                <p>The publication <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi>
                    constitutes the official record of the foreign policy of the United States. The
                    volumes in the series include, subject to necessary security considerations, all
                    documents needed to give a comprehensive record of the major foreign policy
                    decisions of the United States together with appropriate materials concerning
                    the facts which contributed to the formulation of policies. Documents in the
                    files of the Department of State are supplemented by papers from other
                    government agencies involved in the formulation of foreign policy.</p>
                <p>The basic documentary diplomatic record printed in the volumes of the series <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> is edited by the
                    Office of The Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, Department of State. The
                    editing is guided by the principles of historical objectivity and in accordance
                    with the following official guidance first promulgated by Secretary of State
                    Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925.</p>
                <p>There may be no alteration of the text, no deletions without indicating where in
                    the text the deletion is made, and no omission of facts which were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision. Nothing may be omitted for the purpose of
                    concealing or glossing over what might be regarded by some as a defect of
                    policy. However, certain omissions of documents are permissible for the
                    following reasons: <list>
                        <label>a.</label>

                    have been supplemented by materials from decentralized office files, the “lot”
                    files of the Department of State. The editors also examined the record

                        <p>After Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> had
                            briefed the Council, he called on <persName corresp="#p_CARB1">Admiral
                                Carney</persName>, as Acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
                            for the reference presentation. <persName corresp="#p_CARB1">Admiral
                                Carney</persName> introduced General <persName>Lodoen</persName>,
                            and indicated that he would conduct the presentation.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of General <persName>Lodoen</persName>’s report, the
                            President indicated particular concern that our allies undertake a
                            greater proportion of the job of maintenance and repair of weapons that
                            we would provide for them, particularly in time for war. The United
                            States could certainly not be the sole source of such equipment. If it
                            were, as he had once warned certain allied leaders, the United States
                            would in practice be in the position of a dictator. The President added
                            that he believed the United States must do more to make this position
                            clear to its allies.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName>Hoover</persName> indicated some concern with General
                                <persName>Lodoen</persName>’s presentation. He pointed out that in
                            the original concept of force goals in Europe, our strategy was based in
                            part on the ability of the recipient countries to carry their own
                            weight, both in economic and military capabilities. However, said
                            Secretary <persName>Hoover</persName>, he very much doubted if our
                            current strategy, particularly in the Far East, was realistically based
                            on an appraisal of the economic capabilities of the various countries to
                            support the force levels which we had set.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> then pointed
                            out that the Council had before it the task of approving the statement
                            of priorities prepared <pb n="3" xml:id="pg_3" facs="0031"/>by the Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff for the delivery of military end items, which he
                            indicated on a chart.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said that the
                            current statement of priorities contained a significant change. The
                            priority accorded to allied <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> D-day
                            forces had been dropped from the second priority to the third priority.
                            U.S. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> D-day forces remained in the
                            second priority. Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>
                            expressed the fear that the drop in priority for the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> D-day forces would involve a serious
                            delay in <persName corresp="#p_GGAM1">General Gruenther</persName>’s
                            desired build-up of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> air
                            strength.</p>
                        <p>The President, in discussing the problem of priorities in practice as
                            opposed to priorities in theory, said that in point of fact the United
                            States was likely to begin to deliver matériel in the third priority
                            before it had completed delivery of all matériel in the second priority.
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> nevertheless
                            insisted that putting the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> D-day
                            forces in the third priority would seriously slow up the desired rapid
                            build-up of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> air strength. He
                            recommended, therefore, that the allied <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> D-day forces be replaced in the second priority along
                            with U.S. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> D-day forces.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed with Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1"
                                >Stassen</persName> to the point of stating that allied forces who
                            were actually manning the front lines and were stationed in areas vital
                            to U.S. security should be accorded the same priority for the receipt of
                            war matériel as did U.S. forces stationed in similar areas. It was
                            “silly” thought the President, not to have both U.S. and allied <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces in the same state of readiness
                            on D-day.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> commented that
                            the whole problem was one of emphasis rather that of precise priority.
                            He did not believe that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> list of
                            priorities was intended to be rigid.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> replied that the
                            President’s last statement seemed to him to establish the most desirable
                            priority for the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> D-day forces. He
                            reiterated his belief that this was the only way to deal with <persName
                                corresp="#p_GGAM1">General Gruenther</persName>’s problem of trying
                            to build up the air strength in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.
                            The President agreed with Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1"
                                >Stassen</persName>’s remark.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CARB1">Admiral Carney</persName> said that these
                            priorities and, indeed, the whole assistance program, would have to be
                            reviewed in the light of a current strategic concept which was quite
                            different from the strategic concept under which the priority lists and
                            the military assistance programs had originally been established. Such a
                            review, he said, was already under way in the Defense Department.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CARB1">Admiral Carney</persName> expressed
                            agreement with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_AD1"
                            >Anderson</persName>’s earlier statement that the issue was one of
                            emphasis rather than of exact priorities. He added that the United
                            States must take into consideration the capacity of the recipient
                            countries to absorb and maintain military end items from the United
                            States.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0032"/>
                        <p>The President repeated that if these countries demonstrate that they have
                            the capacity mentioned by <persName corresp="#p_CARB1">Admiral
                                Carney</persName>, they should be placed right up in the second
                            priority. He again said that he meant those countries that are actually
                            ready to fight on D-day.</p>
                        <p>Assistant Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_HHS1"
                                >Hensel</persName> expressed agreement to the proposal to move the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> D-day forces into the second
                            priority, but said he doubted whether this move would have very much
                            practical effect on the movement of items. The President said that he
                            was inclined to agree that this would be the case. The President went on
                            to say that this upping of priority should be confined at the present
                            time to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> D-day forces, though
                            perhaps later on Japan could also be moved into the second priority. He
                            indicated that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName>
                            should discuss with the Joint Chiefs the actual wording of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action on this point before the action
                            was submitted to the President for his approval.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> then reminded
                            the Council that there were two other pieces of unfinished business
                            which the Council should consider today in connection with the review of
                            the military assistance program. The first of these was a decision on
                            the long-range force goals for Formosa. The second was a decision as to
                            the amount of assistance to be made available by the U.S. to Turkey for
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 in accordance with the

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> indicated that
                            the Joint Chiefs of Staff were working on the problem of long-range
                            force goals for the Chinese Nationalist armed forces on Formosa.
                            Unhappily, in present circumstances this was a purely academic exercise
                            and would remain so until the situation in the Formosa Straits had been
                            clarified. He therefore recommended that the Council defer action on
                            this matter.</p>

                            to Turkey for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 to meet our
                            commitment to that country. On the other hand, he believed that these
                            funds should not actually be made available to the Turks until receipt
                            of the views of the high-level mission to Turkey, which would attempt to
                            reach conclusions as to the capacity of the Turkish economy to absorb
                            this amount of U.S. assistance without disastrous repercussions.</p>

                            to raise Soviet living standards; (b) more reasonable Soviet position on

                            treaty not yet finalized Soviet intentions seem to be genuine; (c) on

                            threats at West whenever it took measures consolidate strengthen its
                            position. But these measures always were followed by Soviet policies of
                            greater moderation. Soviets now following Lenin–Stalin zig-zag policy of
                            maneuver and West must take care not to relax because of superficial
                            changes in Soviet policy. West was not deterred by Soviet threats—it
                            must not now be deterred by superficial Soviet reasonableness. It must
                            pursue its present course without vacillation, hesitation or
                            weakness.</p>
                        <p>Turkish Foreign Minister commented at some length on dangers of Soviet
                            inspired “peace offensive” which had in effect successfully engendered
                            neutralist and pacifist currents in many countries. Soviet Union by
                            dominating so many countries in Eastern Europe had disrupted European
                            equilibrium and if neutralist trends increased real danger existed that
                            Soviet domination would continue to expand.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> stated that before coming
                            to Paris he had consulted with all party leaders in his coalition
                            Government. They all agreed they were entirely behind him and his policy
                            of firm association with West. It was entirely incorrect to think that
                            Germany had one eye to West and another to East. Austrian developments
                            had no real effect on German public since situation in two countries
                            entirely different. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>
                            commented briefly on opposition of youth in Eastern Zone, stating that
                            partly because of church influence only about 8% of youth now attended
                            Communist inspired ceremonies. He fully agreed with Secretary’s call for
                            continued vigilance stating that Soviet Union would be dictatorship for
                            some time and that dictatorships were always threat to their neighbors.
                            Although there might now be a better climate for international
                            conferences, such conferences must be of long duration since all world
                            problems are intimately linked up and must be considered in time. If
                            conference were called to consider German question this conference would
                            probably be expanded to larger conference at later date to consider
                            other problems; therefore other countries would have to be brought in.
                            In any event, Soviets have not given up their basic intentions and
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> must remain strong, in fact
                            increase its strength.</p>
                        <p>French Foreign Minister briefly commented on need for caution and
                            cohesion and continuance of present <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> policies. Emphasis on Soviet heavy and munitions
                            industries justifies preoccupations of West.</p>
                        <p>Belgian Foreign Minister stated that if there were any tendencies towards
                            relaxation of tensions it was entirely due to successes <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> policies. Any future conference with
                            Soviets must be preceded by careful preparation. Most important of all,
                            West must decide what are objectives of such conference. Western public
                            opinion, somewhat confused, desires such talks but does not know exactly
                            what are Western goals. Public opinion would be badly disillusioned if
                            conference held and no positive results attained. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> advocated that all <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members be consulted in regard to
                            objectives of any future conference, especially as to the defined limits
                            beyond which the Western Powers would not retreat. He paid tribute to
                            firm Western stand at Berlin conference.</p>

                            with Soviets under conditions different from Berlin conference was
                            desirable since West in much stronger position today to resume talks.
                            Also there were indications such as Austria that Soviet policy had more
                            flexibility. US, <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss>, France and Germany
                            all agreed that we should propose a four power meeting with the Soviets
                            although agreement on level of talks had not been reached. Opinion of
                            other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies would be
                            valuable.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> said while Soviet
                            declarations were recently more moderate there was no indication of
                            Soviets abandoning their hold on East Germany and they were also
                            consolidating their military position in the East. He felt that Soviets
                            might direct discussion in any meeting toward European security. The
                            general Soviet idea of forcing US out of Europe was not acceptable.
                            Soviets might propose German neutralization but this also unacceptable
                            since Soviets would insist on controls which would insure control of all
                            Germany. <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> felt at four power
                            meeting West must present constructive program. This might involve
                            mutual assistance treaties with or without limitation of armaments as
                            well as other positive suggestions. If a four power conference failed we
                            should not break off talks with Soviets but should be ready to carry on
                            further exchange of views.</p>
                        <p>Italy thanked <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName>; said that
                            problem of security is indivisible from most of other problems. Soviets
                            seem afraid of German rearmament. Therefore we might reaffirm during
                            negotiations with Soviets our desire for disarmament and consider
                            adopting on each side of Iron Curtain a balanced system of limitation of
                            armaments and forces.</p>

                        <p>He said there is no similarity between German and Austrian problems and
                            we should take firm position immediately that German and Austrian
                            solutions must be different. West should also establish free elections
                            as condition for unification of Germany. A free Austria has positive
                            advantages for the West particularly its example for Satellites.
                            However, Austrian Treaty also gives rise to questions which concern
                            Italy. Question of neutrality and guarantee of Austrian territory raise
                            questions for Austria’s neighbors. Italy accepts a neutral Austria but
                            Austria must be free to participate in international organizations now
                            in existence and free to cooperate on social, political and economic
                            matters. A neutral Austria also raises military problems for the defense
                            of Italy’s eastern frontier which may have an effect on Italy’s force

                        <p>Turkey made reference to statement that he made this morning<note n="4"

                                    >Zorlu</persName>’s warning that the Soviet tactics of
                                enfeebling their smaller neighbors with a view to ultimate
                                domination posed a grave danger to the West, made during the public
                                morning session. See <gloss target="#t_Polto1">Polto</gloss> 2249,
                                    <ref target="#d3"><hi rend="italic">supra</hi></ref>.</note> and
                            expressed appreciation <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName>’s
                            report. Turks could not rejoice about Austria because Soviets trying
                            establish a neutral no-man’s land across Europe in order later to have
                            the military initiative and act against this area which will have low
                            level of armament. On other hand if we oppose Austrian Treaty we would
                            aid Soviet propaganda. Above all Turks believe whole problem of security
                            and disarmament was most important.</p>
                        <p>Dutch said all agreed ultimate aims of Soviet policy to undermine and
                            destroy capitalistic system have not changed. Their immediate aims to
                            achieve above are (a) to undermine unity of West and (b) to prevent
                            German rearmament. In this policy Soviets thus far unsuccessful as
                            Germany now in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The above two
                            Soviet aims have not been defeated. Soviets are still dangerous and
                            their policy involves alternately threats and lumps of sugar. Fully
                            agree with <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> that four
                            power talks will not lead to results in short time. West needs enduring
                            patience and patience particularly hard for Germany which is divided.
                            Some feared Germans would be tempted to yield to Soviet threats or
                            promises and therefore everyone grateful to <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                                >Adenauer</persName> for his determination. Any conference with
                            Soviets will be difficult because we know ultimate Soviet aims have not
                            changed. But we cannot be sure that they won’t eventually change
                            particularly in light of certain Soviet internal weaknesses which may
                            cause them to go further toward meeting the West. One assumption is that
                            Soviets want breathing space to strengthen themselves and overcome their
                            own weaknesses. West is not unwilling to give them a breathing space if
                            it does not endanger its own position and particularly if it does not
                            give up its unity. Therefore, Dutch conclusion is that we <pb n="12"
                                xml:id="pg_12" facs="0040"/>should strengthen Western bonds by every
                            means and if a modus operandi with Soviets is reached we must in no case
                            relax our effort or let our guard down. The present situation has
                            potential dangers of another kind. We have been living under conditions
                            of economic boom longer than at any time in the twentieth century. And
                            in this connection there is no doubt that rearmament has helped the
                            present economic boom. West has made good use of this time and modern
                            economists believe they have found devices to avoid economic crises such
                            as in the thirties. But it would be dangerous to assume economic crises
                            could not occur. Therefore, it is very important that every possible
                            step be taken to strengthen the economic unity between Western
                            nations.</p>
                        <p>Canada expressed appreciation for statements of previous speakers since
                            this gives Canada sense of participation in formulation of policy by
                            those powers with great responsibility. There have been important
                            changes in Soviet policy. While not knowing reason for Soviet changes in
                            tactics it clear Stalin stone-wall tactics modified and in some cases
                            abandoned. Soviet leaders seem to temporarily have abandoned shock
                            tactics of the Revolution for more subtle tactics of gradual absorption.
                            West therefore must change its tactics but not its policy which is
                            working well. West has psychological, political, military and economic
                            strength, to meet Soviets on diplomatic field. We should be more
                            vigilant than ever against easing up and also prevent all efforts to
                            divide us. <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> warmly
                            welcomed decision to take initiative in talks with Soviets. He said too
                            much should not be expected too soon. As to level of talks, “at the
                            summit, the winds were strong and the air rarefied and it was not the
                            best place to work but might well be the best place to begin.” It
                            vitally important that Western participants know what they want to
                            achieve and fully coordinate among themselves.</p>
                        <p>Denmark listened with great interest. While not wishing to arouse false
                            expectations through four power talks public opinion indicates it is
                            expedient to try to meet with the Soviets. It seems therefore important
                            that we take and keep the initiative.</p>
                        <p>Norway agreed with Canada in dual policy of maintaining Western unity and
                            strength and exploiting every possibility to make progress through
                            negotiation. While there is need for flexibility, we must know and fully
                            understand the limits to which we can go in being flexible without
                            giving away our essential and vital positions.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss>. In <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss>
                            there has been long debate between those who support seeking
                            pacification through weakness which is really appeasement. <gloss
                                target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> has resisted appeasement. Soviet
                            attitude re Austria proves that if West is strong it will prevail.
                            However, there must be a proper balance between military measures and
                            economic stability. This <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> has
                            achieved with considerable success. There are those <pb n="13"
                                xml:id="pg_13" facs="0041"/>who argue that any Soviet attitude
                            toward Austria is a trap baited to achieve a greater result. West should
                            take advantage of Austrian settlement but not swallow bait. We must also
                            overcome Soviet propaganda which presents the Austrian settlement as due
                            to Soviet initiative rather than Soviet acceptance of an offer open for
                            many years. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> glad to hear
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s vigorous denial of
                            those who say that Germany entered <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            in order to use possibility getting out of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> as a bargaining point with Soviets to achieve
                            unification. He fully agreed that adoption of new tactics should not
                            involve abandonment of our basic policy and strategy and that we should
                            seek to spread democracy in captive countries. Re four power conference,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> believed this
                            corresponded with deep feeling on part of all people. He could not give
                            composition of conference, but whatever the forum and level, West must
                            enter meeting with a balance between facile optimism and cynical
                            pessimism. A single meeting even of weeks could not solve the problems.
                            We should therefore think of negotiations with the Soviets in terms of
                            an extended period of time during which we would press forward with
                            patience, fairness, and firmness to attain our objectives. All <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries anxious that threat of war
                            be reduced. We seek peace, reduction of tensions, methods of
                            strengthening our unity, and if we push ahead on this course with same
                            moderation and strength we have shown in past few years we will
                            ultimately achieve our objectives.</p>

                            on the Austrian Treaty negotiations in Vienna.</p>
                        <p>The Chairman then proposed adjournment but <persName corresp="#p_SPH1"
                                >Spaak</persName> raised the question of a four-power guarantee for
                            Austria. He said such a guarantee could not be executed without
                            concurrence of Austria’s neighbors and that therefore this was European
                            question in which all were interested. There followed a very confused
                            discussion on the part of a number of Ministers in which some confused
                            Austrian neutrality with the question of territorial guarantee.
                            Secretary got meeting back on tracks by explaining that we are not blind
                            to problems relating to Austria but insofar as we know Soviets seem
                            willing to sign Treaty without pre-conditions. If this is, in fact, the
                            case we will sign. If Soviets pose conditions this would raise other
                            problems. Secretary said that the problems relating to Austrian
                            neutrality and suggestion that there be a territorial guarantee would
                            unquestionably have to be faced but more probably in connection with
                            deposit of ratification. Insofar as US is concerned it has never given a
                            territorial guarantee with the possible exception of Panama where the
                            question of the Canal was involved and it could not give any such
                            guarantee lightly.</p>

                        <p>With respect to comments by several of the Ministers that if Austrian
                            neutrality and territory were guaranteed it might have bad effect on
                            other European states which might seek neutralism, Secretary pointed out
                            that Austrian neutrality did not involve demilitarization. On contrary,
                            we had prodded Soviets who had agreed to remove the limitation on
                            Austrian forces. Therefore Austria would not get a free ride but would
                            be obliged in the first instance to look to its own security and carry a
                            defense burden.</p>

                        <p>Secretary opened by saying he agreed with what many of previous speakers
                            had intimated and what <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName>
                            had stated explicitly that now is the time for the West to take the
                            initiative. It is appropriate to press Soviets for solutions to problems
                            which desperately call for solution. Feeling on part of all our people
                            is that it is time to seize the initiative. Often the people have a
                            sense of rightness and judgment about these matters which is not always
                            rapidly reflected in the views of the political leaders.</p>
                        <p>The question now is what kind of initiative should be taken and how can
                            it be taken without avoiding the dangers referred to by <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> this morning.<note n="3"

                                    >Spaak</persName>’s warning against the dangers of confusing and
                                disillusioning the public if expectations from a conference of major
                                powers exceeds concrete results. See <ref target="#d3">Document
                                    3</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>The first point is that for historical reasons it rests with a few of the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members to take initiative in
                            the initial stage but that any such initiative by a few can only be
                            limited to opening up the problems. No small or limited group of
                            countries can take the responsibility to solve problems in which others
                            have a real interest and are <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0043"
                            />perhaps even more intimately concerned. The present situation is not
                            like that obtaining during the War when it was imperative because of the
                            circumstances that few countries make decisions affecting others. This
                            is not the time for a small group of countries to exercise War powers
                            cutting across the rights of others. To summarize, a few cannot assume
                            to deal with and dispose of the rights of others. All countries
                            concerned must be brought into the solution of problems in which they
                            have a real interest at the proper time.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then asked what a few could do. He felt the most that they
                            could do was to sit down with the Soviets and identify problems calling
                            for a solution and then consider ways and means to bring in those
                            directly concerned. Therefore, Western initiative by several powers must
                            be primarily a procedural and not a substantive initiative. Such
                            procedural considerations involve estimating what problems might be
                            solved by negotiations with Soviets and what problems had best be left
                            for solution in other forums such as the <gloss target="#t_UNO1"
                                >UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary next asked what are problems which might be isolated and
                            identified and to which solutions might be sought by new and vigorous
                            means. In reply, he said that first and foremost was unification of
                            Germany. He believed this must and will be resolved. He did not belong
                            to school who believed unification hopeless. Mentioned that at <gloss

                                    Part 1, pp. 549</ref> ff.</note> most participants believed that
                            hope for Austrian Treaty must be long deferred. It now looked as if
                            Treaty was within our grasp. He believed that same moral forces which
                            had led to present prospect for Austrian Treaty would work against
                            continued division of Germany and would finally prevail. The power of
                            moral influence in the hearts and minds of men is something which cannot
                            be ignored.</p>
                        <p>A second problem which he believed should be discussed with the Soviets
                            was the repression of human and national rights in the captive states.
                            In any negotiation with the Soviets it is imperative to avoid the danger
                            of creating impression that we accept a divided world and the continuing
                            enslavement of the satellites. If we convey any such impression, we will
                            cause millions of people to give up hope. He believed that the
                            repression of human rights in the satellites should be solved not by
                            violence but by the same forces which exerted such an influence in the
                            Austrian case. Today the state of unrest in the satellites is greater
                            than ever before. This is insurance for the West because if unhappily
                            Soviets began a war, their lines of communication would be threatened by
                            satellite unrest. Therefore, West should discuss the position of
                            satellites in talks with the Soviets <pb n="16" xml:id="pg_16"
                                facs="0044"/>in order to let captive peoples know we did not accept
                            their permanent enslavement. Secretary said in alleviating conditions in
                            the satellite states he did not envisage an attempt to create a hostile
                            cordon sanitaire around the Soviet Union but to work toward the
                            establishment of a relationship that is compatible with free and decent
                            relations such as the relationship of Finland.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said atomic threat occupies the minds of all our
                            peoples. In this connection, the President had designated one of our
                            leading officials<note n="5" xml:id="d5fn5">On March 19, President

                            occupy himself with the question of disarmament, which is a very complex
                            subject. He felt that useful work might be done with the Soviets on
                            disarmament perhaps through the <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UN</gloss> or
                            otherwise.</p>
                        <p>The burden of Atlantic community armament is heavy and while it is not
                            possible to reduce this burden now if some new system of arms limitation
                            should be devised the burden might subsequently be somewhat lessened.
                            This might be a task for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>There is also the Far Eastern problem about which he would talk later.
                            Now there are not adequate procedures for dealing with Far East problems
                            but later perhaps some procedure could be found.</p>
                        <p>Secretary summarized by saying above are kind of problems for which there
                            are no quick and hasty solutions. To create impression that they could
                            be solved in days or weeks would be illusory and result in our falling
                            into the trap of letting down our guard. Initially, we should not try to
                            deal with the substance of these complex problems but ascertain how we
                            can go about finding solutions more effectively than in the past. He
                            reemphasized that all who are directly concerned with any problem must
                            participate in its solution, that there could be no deals behind their
                            backs, and that there would be no abandonment of US policies as regards
                            itself or third parties. What was required was to approach our problems
                            with new vigor and hope and devise techniques and procedures enabling
                            orderly but not hasty discussion with the Soviets. He pointed out that
                            as long as matters are under discussion between East and West there is
                            much less likelihood of actions which might lead to the calamity of a
                            general war.</p>

                            “summit” meeting. I am sorry at this unexpected development, but I do
                            not want to see the Austrians in the position where they would from the
                            beginning be in violation of the economic clauses of the Treaty and
                            wholly dependent upon the mercy of the Russians to accept a lesser
                            performance as to which we have no official cognizance and no right to
                            take a position. I feel that either the Austrians should really
                            undertake to comply with the Treaty as written, or if there is a
                            substitute, there should be some kind of a reference to it in the Treaty
                            so that we will be in on that phase of the picture.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that at the

                            had reported on their specific areas of military responsibility. The
                            Standing Group had thereafter reported on the general situation and had
                            presented for the consideration of the Defense Ministers a new three
                            year plan<note n="4" xml:id="d9fn4">Not found in Department of State
                                files.</note> for developing the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> infrastructure and to implement <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> strategy. The infra-structure plan
                            was based on West German membership in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> which had of course somewhat changed the earlier
                            strategy.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that all of
                            the Defense Ministers were in agreement on the serious weakness of the
                            early warning and radar system for Western Europe. The early warning
                            system, such as it was, was based on the individual national states and
                            there was no significant integration.</p>
                        <p>The amount of money called for by the new three year infra-structure
                            proposal amounted to a little over a billion dollars in U.S. currency
                            and was designed to carry out the strategy set forth in <gloss

                                    >footnote 3, Document 6</ref>.</note> Meanwhile, the military
                            people were working on a new strategic concept, designated <gloss

                                in Department of State files.</note> which was a clarification and a
                            forward movement of the old <gloss target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss> 48
                            strategy.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> pointed out that
                            all this “business” might well be importantly affected by what came out
                            of the Geneva Foreign Ministers’ Conference.</p>
                        <p>There had also been much discussion of the German contribution to the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> over-all costs. The Germans
                            themselves were talking in terms of the sum of nine billion marks—a
                            little over two billion dollars in our money. The British and the
                            Americans believed this figure much too low and thought that the Germans
                            should put thirteen to fifteen billion marks in the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> pot. The Germans had <pb n="25"
                                xml:id="pg_25" facs="0053"/>replied that nine billion was all that
                            they could see their way to offering initially or until the next German
                            elections.</p>
                        <p>The several Defense Ministers had all been worried about where they were
                            going to find the funds for their country’s contribution in support of
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Moreover, not a single one of
                            the Defense Ministers present believed that the Soviet threat to the
                            Western world had significantly lessened. On the other hand, they
                            indicated that public opinion in their countries was not of the same
                            mind. Public opinion was accordingly making it very difficult to
                            maintain existing budgetary sights.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> stated that the
                            British defense authorities were doing about the same thing in the
                            United Kingdom that their U.S. opposite numbers were doing here, namely,
                            reducing force levels but not reducing expenditures for defense
                            purposes. Indeed Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                            thought that the next British budget figure for defense might exceed the
                            present level by 100 million pounds sterling, most of which would be
                            spent on new weapons.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> also pointed out
                            that the British were not keeping their divisions in Europe up to full
                            strength. These divisions were maintained at about 70 per cent of their
                            full strength and <persName corresp="#p_GGAM1">General
                                Gruenther</persName> had complained of the situation. While
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that he
                            could not predict that the United Kingdom’s military budget for next
                            year would increase, he did doubt whether the British would reduce the
                            level of their military expenditures significantly.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of his general statement, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that he would be glad to
                            answer any questions.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> inquired how
                            the German contribution related to the discussion of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> strategy. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> replied that the Defense
                            Ministers had assumed that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would
                            go ahead with present plans and that there would ultimately be twelve
                            German divisions for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President inquired whether Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> had at this meeting found any evidence of a
                            “general disenchantment” with the whole <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> concept. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> replied that certainly no such disenchantment was
                            evident among the military people at the meeting. It was for this reason
                            that he did not believe that the military men in general went along with
                            the soft positions that their governments had been taking with respect
                            to the forthcoming negotiations at Geneva on the European Security Plan
                            and German reunification.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that he
                            would sum up by stating that the discussion at the Defense Ministers
                            meeting was, on the whole, pretty realistic. Our own U.S. contribution
                            to the new infra-structure plan (Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> guessed) would be in the neighborhood of 37 <pb
                                n="26" xml:id="pg_26" facs="0054"/>to 40 per cent of the total cost.
                            Currently we were contributing about 42 per cent of the total.</p>
                        <p>While, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, the
                            picture in the Defense Ministers’ mind was generally pessimistic,
                                <persName corresp="#p_GGAM1">General Gruenther</persName> had stated
                            that if the Soviets were to attack now, the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> forces could lick them but that things might not be so
                            hopeful in future.</p>

                            Western positions brought into complete harmony. USSR openly repudiated
                            agreement at Summit by refusing free elections in Germany. Geneva II
                            brought into open rigidity Soviet position re <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> and other satellites. Security proposals of West smoked

                            Showed that USSR could not contemplate election which would jeopardize
                            Communist regimes in East Germany and elsewhere. This estimate, Sec
                            said, was confirmed by Yugoslavs during his recent trip.<note n="12"

                            revelations of Soviet policy are apparent. There seems to be no present

                            is to exacerbate old antagonisms, e.g. USSR identification with Arab

                            Pakistan. USSR possesses three surpluses: arms (those being replaced by
                            newer models), technicians, and words. Sec expects USSR to use all three
                            in stirring up trouble Middle East and South Asia. In summary, year has
                            been typical of zig-zag tactics. First threats, then smiles, then

                                    soldiers by end 1959. Explained naval adjustments in program,
                                    and stressed urgency of adequate air defense. In this connection
                                    expressed concern about construction of airfields in Germany and
                                    asked Council for decisions on infrastructure in January 1956.

                                    do its best to implement recommendations. However, he was not
                                    optimistic about his country, and many others, meeting
                                    requirements of <gloss target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss> 48 within

                                <p>Defense Minister Campney of Canada commented on recommendations
                                    of report as they concerned Canada. Principal recommendation
                                    concerning continuation of mutual aid Canada will examine.
                                    Pointed out that of $1,300 million thus far provided in
                                    assistance to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Europe $300
                                    million was equipment from new production, and $300 million for
                                    air-crew training. Canada expected to reduce slightly its
                                    assistance for coming year. However, all such assistance would
                                    be from new production. In addition Canada has undertaken
                                    substantial expenditure for North American continental air

                                        >Hansen</persName> of Denmark considered AR Report
                                    excellent. Referring to recommendations for Danish Government,
                                    he indicated they already stated [<hi rend="italic"
                                    >started</hi>?] on thorough review their defense effort. Had
                                    established committee for this purpose and was already in
                                    consultation with <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss>.
                                    Although Denmark will support and expedite review, and attempt
                                    remold forces in accordance <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                        >NATO</gloss> military authorities’ recommendations,
                                    emphasized it would be unrealistic to expect Denmark to increase
                                    defense expenditures.</p>
                                <p>Finance Minister <persName corresp="#p_SSF1">Schaeffer</persName>
                                    of Germany then spoke in some detail concerning the effect of
                                    German rearmament upon economy. Emphasized that in economy of
                                    full employment support of defense establishment would need be
                                    at expense other elements. Pointed out that although moneys
                                    would exceed expenditures for first two years of program, West
                                    Germany financial and economic resources would be fully employed
                                    in its defense contribution. Indicated German view that forces
                                    support of other countries, aid to Berlin, and social stability
                                    on border of iron curtain must in real sense be considered as
                                    part of German effort. Concerning need for assistance, he
                                    pointed out there would be considerable production gap for
                                    equipment which could only come from US. He indicated
                                    arrangements had already been made to negotiate to determine
                                    whether such equipment could be supplied, and if so, under what
                                    conditions, including financial arrangements.</p>
                                <p>Defense Minister Handel of Norway indicated Norwegian program
                                    dependent on continuing mutual aid and expressed gratitude for
                                    US and Canadian assistance thus far provided. Finance Minister
                                    Eftaxias spoke of the high percentage of <gloss target="#t_GNP1"
                                        >GNP</gloss> being devoted to defense in Greece and stated
                                    that if Greece eventually could bear larger portion of its
                                    defense effort a long-term program for economic expansion and
                                    growth must be accepted. In the meantime Greece would continue
                                    need for considerable external aid which would enable capital
                                    now absorbed by defense to be turned over to productive
                                    investments.</p>

                                    of multilateral financing, indicated that US intention was not
                                    for discussion groups to make decisions on multilateral
                                    financing but simply to initiate discussion.</p>

                                    Emphasized that all requirements of <gloss target="#t_MC1"
                                        >MC</gloss> 48 and 48/1 could not be financed within
                                    existing levels, and therefore priorities which must be financed
                                    in first instance by individual governments must be identified.
                                    Urged that all governments look far into future as possible
                                    indicating <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> now planning seven

                                    paragraph 3(a) he still believed not appropriate for
                                    incorporation in resolution as discussion financing techniques
                                    involved use of experts which not anticipated would be available

                                presentation urging approval <gloss target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss> 54.
                                Pointed out that there were two factors involved; command
                                arrangements and air defense itself. Stated <gloss target="#t_MC1"
                                    >MC</gloss> 54 addressed only two command arrangements, and that
                                although some countries felt paper did not go far enough, while
                                others felt paper may have gone too far, he believed paper
                                represented appropriate first step. <persName corresp="#p_GGAM1"
                                    >Gruenther</persName> then went on to explain what was
                                technically involved in command communication, indicating immediate
                                necessity for two pilot projects to be established. He stated US had
                                been asked to finance these two pilot projects. Emphasized value of
                                West’s proposal for aerial inspection to prevent surprise attack.
                                Concluded by turning to problem of different nature, pleading with

                            links in command communication system. He indicated this being done,
                            however, upon condition that this equipment will become and remain
                            property of <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss>, and action will not
                            be construed as precedent for financing entire system. Financing of
                            entire system would have to be on a common cost sharing basis.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGAP1">General Billotte</persName> of France agreed
                            with <persName corresp="#p_GGAM1">General Gruenther</persName>’s concern
                            about air defense and indicated France’s acceptance <gloss
                                target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss> 54. However, pointed out that there must
                            be limit to integration of command responsibility beyond which countries
                            would not go as it would involve relinquishment sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>Minister Star of Netherlands took opposite tack from French and although
                            indicating willingness to accept <gloss target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss> 54 as
                            first step, believed <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would need
                            eventually face logic of situation wherein effective air defense could
                            only be accepted by going much further in direction of common command.
                            Believed natural corollary of this development would be extension of
                            infrastructure procedure for financing. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CPAV1"
                                >Cunha</persName> of the Portuguese Delegation regarded <gloss

                            to need for extending scope of this command coordination to include

                            Real problem is how to deal with it. Communiqué this meeting will be
                            especially important as first statement since Geneva II. He
                            congratulated three powers on conduct Geneva negotiations; common
                            interests had been well defended. Soviet moves in Middle East and Asia
                            should not lead West to think European problems solved. Must make clear
                            that Geneva was not end and that West still supports its principles and
                            German unity. West not doing well in propaganda battle and should take
                            steps to improve. Strong and firm communiqué could help.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> made following points: 1)
                            Geneva II showed fears that Soviet policy might split West were
                            unfounded. Three Powers there worked in complete harmony which was
                            greatly helped by German cooperation at all levels. Should pay tribute
                            to staunchness Germans in face Geneva outcome on unity. 2) Soviet
                            rejection Western security proposals Geneva showed attitude Germany
                            unity based on political and not security reasons. Essential drive this
                            point home. 3) Soviet desire disrupt <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> not solely military in purpose. They want destroy
                            organization where Old and New World act in partnership and where
                            likeminded nations can act together. If <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> undermined, Soviets could take over one at a time. 4)
                            West must not accept stalemate but keep up moral, political, propaganda
                            and other pressures on Soviets to solve outstanding issues. In “tearing

                        <p>The discussion under this agenda item was considerably more lively than
                            expected, and indicated a general feeling among many <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members that more consideration than
                            in the past should be given to the development of a collective policy in
                            the political, economic, and psychological fields. Partly as a result of
                            the recent change in Soviet tactics, and partly as a result of the need
                            for types of cooperation other than military, many countries seemed to
                            be groping for ways of implementing Article 2. It should be said,
                            however, than in no instance did this reflect a subordination of the
                            importance of maintaining a high degree of military defensive strength;
                            but on the contrary, reflected an attempt to think through other ways
                            and means of giving long-term substance and content to <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. A brief summary of national
                            statements follows:</p>
                        <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0070"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MG1">Martino</persName> spoke for Italy, stating
                            that recent developments and changes in Russian attitude have
                            transferred problems of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> from
                            purely military field to other fields, thus making an exchange of views
                            on Article 2 extremely pertinent. Pointing out that non-military
                            cooperation under Article 2 covers three aspects, political,
                            psychological, and economic, <persName corresp="#p_MG1"
                                >Martino</persName> noted with satisfaction the growing political
                            cooperation within <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>. He called for
                            further alignment of policies with respect to psychological activities
                            and mentioned desirability of “psychological plan of
                            infrastructure”.</p>
                        <p>Addressing need for further economic and social cooperation, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MG1">Martino</persName> pointed to Russian initiative in
                            helping underdeveloped areas as further reason for <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>’s consideration of ways and means to
                            participate in common action to help underdeveloped areas. He led from
                            this thought into advocacy of common <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> action to build up weaker countries within <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, stating “it is necessary to
                            undertake collective action for development of economically weak areas
                            within the Alliance.” He pointed to need for common European market and
                            said that Italy is not thinking so much in terms of direct action by
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in competition with other
                            international organizations, but rather that <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> should be forum in which action in various specialized
                            agencies should be stimulated. He proposed study of problem at Perm Rep
                            level and discussion at next Ministerial session.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BBJW1">Beyen</persName> spoke for Netherlands. He
                            said it is generally realized that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            more than purely military organization and that development of common
                            way of thinking and living is basis of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. This is more difficult than cooperation in military
                            field. Pointed out that political consultation in <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> had grown steadily. Expressed view
                            that it would not be wise to bring matters into <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> forum if they can be done better in other ways. For
                            example, accomplishments of <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> in
                            field of economic cooperation is partial implementation of Article 2.
                            While favoring coordination of psychological efforts, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BBJW1">Beyen</persName> pointed that this should not

                            should consider other aspects of treaty, but stressing defensive
                            military strength as most important single problem facing Alliance. Next

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> for Canada said that

                            that action thereunder can only be slow and gradual. Felt that accent
                            should be on more thorough exchange political ideas and development of

                        <p>Canada, in suggesting discussions on current economic policies among

                            any new economic paraphernalia. Purpose is to develop better
                            understanding of each others economic policies. Though economic

                            that British intend maintain high quality defense position but in light
                            of limited finances, foreign exchange problems and general strained
                            condition of economy was essential to know how much troop support would
                            be continued after May 5, 1956. Had delayed suggesting meeting with
                            Germans until after German <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            submission. Felt determination of extension of support costs should be
                            based upon equitable sharing of burdens in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. Any inequitable arrangements would lead to political
                            strains and weaken <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> alliance.
                            Stated it seemed possible for Germans “next year” to spend “fair”
                            portion on own forces. Accordingly felt extension of support costs
                            appropriate. Stated that failure to reach agreement on adequate level
                            might have effect upon British defense level. Emphasized that British
                            situation so tight that there was little room for maneuver.<note n="2"

                            year. In view internal political problems would be impossible to
                            increase taxes enough to meet peak year of expenditures. Thus must have

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SSF1">Schaeffer</persName> repeated intention to

                            This must be non-discriminatory.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> emphasized difficulty of
                            looking too far ahead and urged review situation from time to time. Had
                            expected that German forces would be organized earlier. Stated hard for
                            country explain need to keep large military forces away from home during
                            peace. We must explain that this is part of common effort in which
                            everyone is doing best he can. He felt it reasonable to review problem
                            at this time.</p>
                        <p>German Defense Minister Blank stated that <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> has agreed to German 3–4 year buildup from January 1.
                            This decision could not be reviewed. In 1956, 100,000 Germans would be
                            mobilized and German government will need all available funds for this
                            purpose. Next year financial gap will exist, solution concerning which
                            is as yet unclear. Thus if support costs were paid it would mean that
                            German forces could not be established at given sizes within given
                            period.</p>
                        <p>French Finance Minister agreed must (1) be no discrimination against
                            Germans and (2) equitable burden sharing. Stated that the legal aspects
                            of Article 4, Section 4 of Finance Convention indicated possibility of
                            goods and services but also did not exclude the possibility of specific
                            financial sum. Recommended negotiation under Article 4 covering
                            examination of overall estimate of contribution of each power under
                            cost-sharing formula.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SSF1">Schaeffer</persName> repeated opposition to
                            any cash payments and referred to carryover from occupation costs of

                            represent defense expenditure in next budget. This is in addition to
                            other defense expenditures. Stated that if German people were told that
                            German contingents could not be formed as fast as planned because funds
                            needed for forces of other countries that this would have immediately
                            adverse effects on 1957 election, with probable result that <persName

                            under “goods and services” he had in mind the use by forces of barracks,

                            buildup. More money spent on support costs would be result increase
                            requirement for eternal aid. Accordingly <persName corresp="#p_SSF1"

                            There should also be discussion of the gap and of prospects of German

                            Germany to defend all free world. Strategy does not include defense of

                            today, it would not include large part of Germany.</p>

                            “completely unacceptable” to Germany. No legal basis existed under
                            Article 4 and it in fact would be publicly recognized as being
                            discriminatory as no similar conditions existed in other <gloss

                            would increase request for external aid. <persName corresp="#p_GG1"
                                >Gray</persName> asked whether 3.2 was “unacceptable” on fiscal or

                            replied “both”, laying primary emphasis on political. Stated that
                            proposal would require reopening plans for first year of buildup after

                            and stated that if there existed a marked disparity between German and

                            to avoid them, but they could have bad effect on alliance as a whole.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said sudden changes
                            involved real difficulties. Recognized rapid buildup created
                            difficulties for Germans. Sudden loss of support would involve
                            difficulties for <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> and some of
                            different character for US. He appealed for effort to reach agreement in

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SSF1">Schaeffer</persName> stated that German
                            Government could not accept extension support costs regardless of
                            justifications set forth because discriminatory. Should push forward
                            strategy and therefore should put emphasis upon German buildup and not
                            attempt to divert funds. Stated that Federal Republic prepared to render
                            services and goods and commodities as in other host <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries. In case of Germany burden
                            would be considerably larger because of number of allied troops
                            stationed in Germany. As for opening negotiations under Article 4,
                            stated he was prepared provided it was understood there would be no cash
                            payments, and that goods and services would be furnished on same legal
                            basis and same extent as provided by other host countries. Said he was
                            prepared at any time to open negotiations on imports of military
                            equipment and transfer problem, but would welcome negotiation on US aid
                            first, because this necessary to clarify what Germans would have to buy
                            abroad. <persName corresp="#p_SSF1">Schaeffer</persName> stated that he
                            had advised Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>
                            that Germany would submit memorandum about January 15<note n="5"

                            making specific suggestions on additional external aid. He would be
                            prepared to open discussions of Article 4 (on his terms) after that
                            date. In reply to question by <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1"
                                >Lloyd</persName> as to whether Germans expected US reply to

                                corresp="#p_SSF1">Schaeffer</persName> merely commented that it
                            would be “helpful” if this could first be settled.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> stated that support costs
                            and external aid problems dissimilar. Aid is longer term problem.
                            Today’s discussion only had to do with next couple of years. Therefore
                            better to look at next two years and will then keep working together on

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> stated that it would be
                            dangerous to assume that proposed German note of January 15 would aid in
                            solving this problem. US interested in knowing what Germany will buy in
                            US. Was dangerous to assume possibility of additional grant aid that
                            could influence availability of funds for goods and services. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said it would confuse matter to

                            skiing) but would be prepared about middle of month. In reply to

                            realized question of whether Germany could obtain items from US for

                            This would effect transfer problem and German purchases of military

                            and stated that <persName corresp="#p_SSF1">Schaeffer</persName>’s
                            proposals would be discriminatory as Germany would not carry its full

                        <p>There follows a summary of the discussion at the meeting and the main
                            points taken.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion of agenda item 1, significant world developments
                            affecting United States security.]</p>

                                    >NATO</gloss> Council Meeting</hi></p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> said that he
                            would report very briefly on this subject, since he had already reported
                            on the meeting to the President. All in all, it was one of the best
                            meetings that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council had ever
                            had. It was notable for its cohesion, solidarity, and particularly for
                            the sense of continuity. The communiqué that had followed the conclusion
                            of the meeting had had a more dynamic <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51"
                                facs="0079"/>quality and a better propaganda value than any that had
                            preceded it. The members of the Council had shown particular enthusiasm
                            for the statement on new weapons and also on our willingness to offer a
                            pilot operation for the so-called scatter system of communications.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> concluded by
                            suggesting that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1"
                                >Humphrey</persName> might have a word to add.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that the
                            only point omitted by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName> was the obvious effort at the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council meeting to expand the scope
                            of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>’s economic activity, a
                            development which Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1"
                                >Humphrey</persName> thought might or might not be useful. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> replied that of course
                            we could always expect some effort at these meetings to involve the
                            United States in further economic support for <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. His own guess was that these moves were mostly
                            propaganda and wouldn’t come to very much in the realm of genuine
                            economic planning.</p>

                            4 and 5, 1956, was attended by the Foreign Ministers of the 15 member
                            countries. The United States Delegation was headed by Secretary of State

                        <p>The Secretary of State and his advisers left Washington on May 1. In his
                            departure statement, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            stressed the importance of the forthcoming meeting because he believed
                            the North Atlantic community needed “to organize itself into something
                            more than a military alliance” and expected the representatives would
                            begin “to search out new ways to express our common purposes.” For text

                                April 23, where he explored the possibility of strengthening the
                                nonmilitary ties of the Allies, see Department of State <hi

                            and said that a number of people had thought he was suggesting <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> assume responsibility for economic
                            operations. That was not his intention. We were confronted with new
                            types of problems with which <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> had a
                            legitimate concern, and his suggestion was far more fundamental than
                            proposing that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> assume a new
                            economic operating function. He observed that following Stalin’s death
                            Soviet Government embarked upon a new line of: 1) exploiting differences
                            between Western countries; 2) endeavoring wean away newly independent
                            countries through economic offers, and capitalizing upon latent
                            prejudices in those countries, and 3) trying to wreck the West through
                            economic competition. We were now faced with situation in which a
                            totalitarian power was operating in competition with free world economic
                            system, where profits were essential to commercial enterprises. For
                            political reasons Soviets were using their industrial power, cutting
                            down their own requirements and setting prices regardless of commercial
                            considerations. Secretary thought it essential that <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> powers do some careful thinking about
                            this problem and how to cope with new Soviet policy.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Lloyd</persName> stated that he thought
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> could perform usefully in the
                            exchange of information and planning, but he questioned whether it
                            should have any role for economic action.</p>
                        <p>Secretary agreed that it should have no operating role in this field. It
                            was a good body to discuss, on a community interest basis, how the
                            objectives might be achieved. Actual implementation of an action program
                            would fall elsewhere.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Lloyd</persName> observed that one possible
                            course in meeting this new Soviet challenge might be to rely upon United
                            Nations for provision of international aid and to force Soviets to do
                            likewise. He would not favor this course unless it were essential.
                            Alternative might be to set up an organization of “donors” who had
                            capital surpluses available for aid to other countries. He inquired
                            whether the Secretary would prefer this course to some other, such as
                            use of existing institutions like the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1"
                                >IBRD</gloss> and creation of other organizations like proposed
                            African Bank.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said he had been thinking about this problem but had no firm
                            views as yet.</p>

                            Ministers who would study matter over next few months and come up with
                            some sort of conclusions. We were studying it in United States and group
                            engaged in this work would make its report about middle of November so
                            that it would be available before Congress met in January. He hoped

                            was impressed by Secretary’s ideas, he would much rather embark upon
                            wider international discussions after he had made up his mind as to what
                            he would want to do. He suggested possibility of United States, United
                            Kingdom and Canada talking over the problem before bringing in all
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> powers.</p>
                        <p>Replying to <persName>Caccia</persName>’s question, Secretary said US

                        <p>It would involve standing committees on technical assistance, banking

                            bilateral and multilateral arrangements as Colombo Plan.</p>
                        <p>He understood paper would be distributed to other delegations and that

                        <p><persName>Caccia</persName> observed that an advantage to forming small
                            committee, as suggested by Secretary, would be that it could study
                            problem and submit a report to all members of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> for consideration.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Lloyd</persName> agreed it would be much
                            better to have small committee members of which would come to us for

                        <p>Secretary replied he would, and would like rearrange agenda to have
                            matter discussed May 4 rather than May 5 to give more time for

                            suggestion on ground would be difficult for other Ministers criticize

                            war, nor to risk a war. He feels Soviets wish be accepted as respectable
                            member family of nations. Russians still thinking of “steamroller”
                            tactics. However, not military but technical, economic, surplus arms,

                            what is happening inside Soviet Union itself. Middle class emerging and
                            private property permitted. Can Soviet state contain pressures generated
                            by this kind evolution? Objective of Communist domination of world
                            remains same, though tactics changed. New tactics are massive
                            penetration economic, technical, cultural of rest world. Russia has
                            appeal to under-developed and uncommitted countries. Was under-developed

                            and nuclear deterrent, but must review pattern our forces. Must revise
                            and preserve political aspect alliance. Find ways and means of competing

                            met on worldwide basis. Not much time to decide on action we must set in
                            train. Russians have been moving with their new policy for better part
                            of year. Must hold fast to basic concept <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> alliance. Attack on one is attack on all. Our

                        <p>3. Koprulu said peaceful co-existence is Stalinist conception. Return to
                            Leninism means nothing. Previously Stalin had called for peaceful
                            co-existence when Soviets needed peace on their frontiers in order to
                            cope with internal problems. This maneuver had been purely tactical,
                            strategy had remained the same, that of Lenin, world domination. Today
                            parallel situation, Soviets need peace, are resorting to same maneuver.
                            Must draw attention our peoples that Soviet professions of peace not
                            corroborated by facts. If we fail to do this risk compromise our
                            security. If we allow public opinion believe there is chance Soviets
                            sincere, we playing with fire. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"

                            contacts with Soviets are important and West has nothing to lose, since
                            Communist parties in West already propagandize for Soviets. West has no
                            party inside Russia and must penetrate Soviets through technicians,

                        <p>Soviet tactics started to change last year. Trend has continued with less
                            emphasis on violent methods and more on other ones suitable to
                            accomplish Soviet ends.</p>
                        <p>Change inside USSR, manifested by denial of Stalin, could not have
                            occurred without demand from within for liberalization.</p>
                        <p>Must remember Soviet tactics subject to rapid change. Could change back
                            to threats as rapidly. No public control of foreign policy in USSR. Is
                            still despotism, and this important respecting military situation. They
                            appear to rely less on violence, probably due to alliances, which
                            frustrated their aims. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            attitude London indicates change only skin deep and shows danger of
                            Soviet military blackmail and threats if Free World weakens.</p>
                        <p>Likely Soviets may unilaterally reduce military force levels. Need
                            manpower. Soviets like others cannot accomplish all goals at once. They
                            can cut substantially in force levels and still leave Soviets dominant
                            on Eurasian continent. If this happens, should not be taken as signal
                            West can cut its forces. They have advantages of ability to call back
                            reserves and have no logistic problem such as faces United States with
                            transoceantic lines of communication.</p>
                        <p>New tactic of keeping force in hand but in background creates serious
                            problem for allies.</p>
                        <p>Tactics primarily designed disrupt unity of West and bring under Soviet
                            and <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> domination newly
                            independent nations which have one-third world population and vast
                            resources.</p>
                        <p>Must look at strength and vulnerabilities of Atlantic community. This
                            community of four hundred million people based on views of nature of man
                            which led Western civilization to invent, explore and carry its beliefs
                            throughout world, with advantage both to us and to recipients.</p>
                        <p>Most important weakness is West not yet able establish peace system
                            within own members. Recurrent wars with waste of youth and resources
                            appears morally bad to rest of world. Though West dominated half the
                            world, this concept of freedom and rights of man meant this domination
                            was transitory, not permanent. The recent <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62"
                                facs="0090"/>creation of many new states is tribute to Western
                            civilization, but it is not accepted with gratitude by new nations.
                            Resentment, sensitivity and prejudice, based on old attitude of white
                            superiority, expose new states to Communists, who exploits these
                            factors. We are very vulnerable concerning this vast area, once a
                            reserve for the West, which now may become one Communists.</p>
                        <p>Soviets rapidly being industrialized and making offers to new and
                            under-developed states. Profit system faced with statism, which does not
                            count costs. Should remember Stalin not only said war not inevitable,
                            but that Soviets should sit on sidelines, add a push where weakness in
                            West appears and take West piece by piece. Soviets have never repudiated
                            that line.</p>
                        <p>No reason be discouraged. West has vast assets; and its belief in nature
                            of man sound will prevail as it always has against those who treat men
                            like cogs. Fabulous production of United States possible because of free
                            men’s desire. United States now has three times production of USSR.
                            Though Soviet production increasing percentagewise, margin of
                            productivity not likely to change appreciably.</p>
                        <p>Will developments of those who seek freedom be thwarted by victories
                            abroad of Soviet pseudo liberals, who then will not have to grant
                            greater liberties at home? “Winning cold war” could mean evolution of
                            Soviet into respectable member of society of nations, when two or three
                            men no longer able decide to start war, with informed public opinion
                            affecting government decisions. There is a beginning here, which stems
                            from firmness and unity of West. We have passed first decade with no war
                            and some liberalization inside USSR. If we can continue do the same in
                            second decade, liberal forces within will demand more freedom. But if
                            they get victories before they make concessions, West will lose. This is
                            task to which we will say more later.</p>

                                    could employ threats of violence to extract from the free
                                    nations such concessions as would in effect make them subject to

                                        out among themselves, or follow divergent policies vis-à-vis

                                <item>We must maintain such economic relations with the newly
                                    developing countries of the world that they will see that they
                                    can in freedom achieve their legitimate aspirations for
                                    improving economic conditions and a beginning of
                                    industrialization which will tend to diversify their economies.
                                    Today, Communism rules about 800 million or one-third of the
                                    human race. About 1,600 million are free, but of these free,
                                    approximately 1,000 million belong to so-called underdeveloped
                                    countries which are exposed to the Soviet economic tactics. If
                                    those tactics should prevail, the world ratio as between
                                    Communist dominated peoples and free peoples would change from a
                                    ratio of two-to-one in favor of freedom to a ratio of
                                    one-to-three against freedom.</item>

                        <p rend="center">II</p>
                        <p>I think it can fairly be said that of these three tasks only one is
                            adequately organized—that is the first. The North Atlantic Treaty
                            Organization provides an effective mechanism for assuring the strength
                            of the Atlantic community and this organization is supplemented by
                            collective defense arrangements which cover much of the Far East,
                            Southeast Asia and the Middle East. So long as the free world maintains
                            its own strength and unity it can feel that there are adequate
                            mechanisms to defend that unity as against open armed attack.</p>
                        <p>The Atlantic community is not yet adequately organized to maintain union
                            between its members and to ensure harmony of policy of its members
                            toward the Soviet-Chinese Communist bloc. There are a whole series of
                            organizations designed to promote such unity. There is <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> itself. There is the Brussels Treaty
                            for Western European Union. There is the Council of Europe. There is the
                                <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0096"/>Coal and Steel Community.
                            There is the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_EPU1">EPU</gloss>. These represent important unifying
                            efforts, but it cannot be confidently affirmed that these organizations
                            are clearly adequate to ensure against a tragic repetition of the past
                            where the Atlantic community, and particularly Western Europe, has been
                            torn apart by internecine struggles. Already today we see that the unity
                            of our Alliance is seriously disturbed by the Cyprus question. The
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial Council does
                            provide a place to exchange views with reference to the international
                            policies of the members, which are of common concern, but this
                            consultation is sporadic and by no means systemized by any agreement as
                            to what should be brought here in a search for common counsel and what
                            can be dealt with independently without such consultation, nor has
                            Europe yet achieved adequate institutions to ensure the freedom of
                            commerce and the wide markets essential for economic vitality and
                            growth.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the newly developing areas considerable action is being
                            taken, but here again the action is not assuredly adequate to give these
                            countries confidence that they can without dependence upon Communist aid
                            develop their economies in accordance with their legitimate aspirations.
                            Their hopes are perhaps now inflated by Communist propaganda which
                            exaggerates the Communist achievements while it ignores the price paid
                            in terms of human misery and servitude.</p>
                        <p>There are a number of programs such as the Colombo Plan, a series of
                            bilateral arrangements, certain United Nations activities and certain
                            economic appendages to collective security arrangements, all of which
                            concern themselves with this problem, but there is no consensus as to
                            how best to deal with the problem nor is there adequate appraisal or
                            coordination as to such planning as occurs.</p>
                        <p rend="center">III</p>
                        <p>In the light of the foregoing it seems appropriate that this Council
                            should urgently initiate a study of how the Atlantic community can best
                            meet the new problems which confront us and for which, as yet, no
                            adequate solution has been found.</p>
                        <p>A number of specific and interesting proposals have been made.</p>
                        <p>I do not desire at this point to give any precise indication as to what
                            the United States thinks a solution should be other than to say this: <list>

                                <item>The search for unity in the Atlantic community has two
                                    aspects. First we should extend, deepen and regularize the habit
                                    of consultation which has been developing. Only in this way can
                                    we ensure that we will agree and remain agreed on our basic
                                    policies in the period when the divisive tactics of the Soviets
                                    are less crude. <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0097"/>Only in
                                    this way can we ensure that incipient quarrels among the members
                                    of our own community will not grow into proportions which
                                    threaten our own strength and unity. Secondly, the Atlantic
                                    community should constantly strive to develop the possibilities
                                    for greater unity as between its component parts. These
                                    possibilities should be explored at all levels and not assume
                                    that any one formulation is itself sufficient: There are degrees
                                    of unity which can be practically and usefully achieved by a few
                                    but which cannot be similarly achieved by many. This
                                    particularly applies to unities along functional and geographic
                                    lines. There are, however, certain areas where unity needs to be
                                    sought on a broad basis. That notably applies to foreign
                                    policies involving relations with the source of common danger,
                                    but the establishment of this area of unity should by no means
                                    exclude, but should be assigned to promote, other forms of unity
                                    and integration which would preserve the West from a continuance
                                    of internal struggles which have been characteristic of its
                                    past.</item>

                                <item>The efforts of the Atlantic community to sustain the freedom
                                    of the newly developing countries and to maintain friendly
                                    relations with them would not be promoted by any organized
                                    effort of the Atlantic community to develop the seemingly
                                    imposed economic programs upon others. This might be
                                    misrepresented as a revival, in an economic form, of Western
                                    colonalism. Any acceptable way must provide equality for the
                                    underdeveloped countries and the taking of their viewpoint into
                                    consideration at the outset of any planning, not merely at the
                                    end after plans have been formulated. The Colombo Plan is
                                    perhaps the best method yet devised for cooperative planning
                                    between the more highly developed and the less highly developed
                                    countries of the world. However, we cannot realistically ignore
                                    the relationship which exists between defensive military efforts
                                    by certain of the less developed countries and the need for
                                    giving them what the United States calls “defensive support”,
                                    that is economic aid without which an adequate defense
                                    establishment cannot be sustained.</item>

                        <p>The free nations have had what has not been called, but which in
                            retrospect we might well call, a “first postwar ten-year plan,”. It is
                            time to be thinking in terms of a “second-year plan” which will solidify
                            freedom and enable the free peoples so to use their vast moral and
                            material resources that their conduct and example will exert in
                            attracting influence throughout the whole world.</p>
                        <p>I suggest that we might ask two or three of our number to undertake
                            urgently to consult with each of the members of the North Atlantic
                            Treaty and indeed, if they deem desirable, with non-members who are
                            associated with the West in other ways, with a view to reporting not
                            later than next fall how, it seems, the Atlantic community can best
                            further organize itself to deal with the problems that lie ahead.</p>

                            (A). Said <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> must be certain not give
                            impression military effort will be disbanded. Must maintain essential
                            military framework. This he said consistent his earlier remarks that
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries must get full value
                            for defense funds expended, and pattern of forces must be up-to-date.

                            should take others into confidence re intentions in advance. Suggested
                            more attendance by individual Ministers at regular Council meetings.

                                        ><hi rend="italic">Supra</hi></ref>.</note>). Secretary
                            opened by saying that he felt <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is
                            at a critical moment in its life and that there might be
                            misunderstanding between us if it was felt by many of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members that the danger was over. The
                            US does not think so. Secretary then said while there may be be less
                            danger of open armed attack on Europe, danger would be no less than it
                            ever had been if Soviet ever gained a clear military supremacy.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then reviewed world
                            situation in light of increased dangers in Far and Middle East. He
                            agreed with previous remarks <persName corresp="#p_LHM1"
                                >Lange</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Lloyd</persName>
                            that we need to accentuate our efforts of demonstrating strength and
                            vitality of basic values of West. Sec said problem is how Atlantic
                            community can best organize itself not only to continue military effort
                            but also to move into other fields. A change as basic as this requires
                            careful explorations. Secretary then reviewed pros and cons of various
                            economic proposals which had been made, listed the problems of using
                                <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> because of its neutrals,
                            problems of use <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, including its
                            relation to the <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UN</gloss>. Secretary then
                            returned to his view that problem of what Atlantic community should do
                            to meet present day conditions required thorough and exhaustive study,
                            including how to make the most of the many already-established
                            multilateral organizations, and ended his statement by saying he would
                            be greatly disappointed if <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council
                            did not feel time had come for evolutionary development and that a group
                            was needed to study problem very carefully. As far as personnel
                            concerned, he endorsed <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Lloyd</persName>’s
                            suggestion (<persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MG1">Martino</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LHM1"
                                >Lange</persName>).</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HHCS1">Hansen</persName> agreed in general with
                            Secretary’s and <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Lloyd</persName>’s remarks
                            but he said he thought task of economic aid to underdeveloped countries
                            should be left to <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UN</gloss>, but admitted there
                            was not much hope of this happening soon, and since problem is an urgent
                            one, other means would have to be found.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_LHM1">Lange</persName> urged that a precise
                            definition of what committee was supposed to do be made immediately.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> spoke of difficulties
                            committee would face but agreed that <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> is reaching a critical point and said that unless we
                            recognized that while we are right in giving emphasis to non-military
                            matters, this should not obscure fact <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73"
                                facs="0101"/>of other (military) dangers, which if forgotten might
                            mean quick end of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_IBHL1">Ismay</persName> asked if Council would
                            adopt conclusion that a group of their own members should be set up to
                            undertake terms of reference. On Secretary’s suggestion <persName
                                corresp="#p_IBHL1">Ismay</persName> elaborated by calling his
                            proposal interim approval to set up a Committee of Three to undertake
                            work, which would be defined later.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> spoke next and said he had
                            not heard anyone say that military effort should be lessened and he saw
                            no disarmament around corner or any reason to relax. Believes it
                            important that we increase attempts at <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> political solidarity. If we do not have a political
                            understanding, then truly there will exist a crisis in <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. As for economic problems and what
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should do, said for time being
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should concentrate on military
                            and political fields. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> said
                            economic problems so difficult and important he wished to think it over
                            later. General line of <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>’s
                            remarks was that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was not doing too
                            badly in the military and political fields and certainly should not
                            relax in them, but that it should stay out of economic field. Secretary
                            said he disagreed with <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> if
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> thought Atlantic
                            community was doing all it could to strengthen its own unity. United
                            States believes that there was a time when cohesion except in a more
                            positive, more dynamic association. US is willing to associate itself in
                            strengthening of Atlantic community through increased political
                            consultations, but we wish to make sure that what we do is well defined.
                            We can find ways to deal with the situation if other members do not
                            desire to make community a more vital and stronger political force, but
                            there will be a crisis if feeling here is that everything is fine and
                            nothing more has to be done.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: I dictate this as we have
                            recessed at 8 o’clock to reconvene later tonight at 10:30 or 11. It has
                            been a difficult day, primarily dealing with our project and trying to
                            develop further the Atlantic community particularly in terms of its own
                            unity. All of our allies are willing to follow the Italian lead and have
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> turned into an economic
                            organization which can probably extract a little more money out of the
                            United States; but when it comes to doing anything to develop Western
                            European unity or any real cohesion with respect to policies vis-à-vis
                            the Soviet Union, then there is very marked evasiveness. I believe we
                            shall get in some form recognition of the need to develop the purposes
                            of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> along other than military
                            lines, and it has been tentatively agreed to designate as the “Three

                            am afraid, be expressed in rather grudging and minimum terms that hardly
                            are responsive to our hopes or the needs of the situation. However, I am
                            perhaps a bit tired and cynical at the moment and our night session

                        <p>In his opening remarks, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName> emphasized that the meeting he had just attended
                            consisted of the Foreign Ministers of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> nations. Accordingly, the military aspects of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, as such, had not been gone into. He
                            regarded the meeting as particularly important because so much of the
                            future of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> depended upon it,
                            especially the non-military aspects of the future of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> reminded the Council of the
                            sentiment which had developed in recent months respecting the need for
                            greater political unity among the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            powers. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> had
                            responded to this with his suggestion for a discussion of this subject
                            and, indeed, his suggestion had been the principal topic at the recent
                            meeting. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>
                            confessed that he had detected among his colleagues more enthusiasm over
                            the possibility of the United States giving economic aid through <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and submitting its foreign policy for
                            review by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, than to the reverse
                            idea of the other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> powers
                            submitting their policies for review. Moreover, a certain lack of
                            solidarity among the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> powers was
                            quite evident at the meeting. As examples of this lack of solidarity,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> cited the fact
                            that the following important issues had never been discussed by the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> powers: The withdrawal of
                            French <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces from Europe to North
                            Africa; the Cyprus question; Middle East policy; and British action in
                            Buraimi.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> had pointed out
                            to his colleagues at the meeting that the unity of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> could never be maintained if the
                            issues and problems cited above were in each instance treated
                            independently and unilaterally. If this continued to be the practice,
                            the alliance of the Western powers would gradually fall apart, as had
                            happened in the past as the aftermath of a war. As a result of Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>’ warning, and after a
                            considerable battle, the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Foreign
                            Ministers finally agreed to the establishment of a committee of three,
                            the Foreign Ministers of Canada, Norway and Italy, who were to confer
                            with all the member governments of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            and thereafter make a report, perhaps in the early autumn, on what could
                            and should be done, through <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> or
                            otherwise, to create an Atlantic Community Council with the objective of
                            achieving greater unity in Western policy. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> thought that this was a good
                            committee and one which would be sympathetic to the goals we have in
                            mind.</p>
                        <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> said that in view
                            of the fact that he would have to leave shortly to go down to Capitol
                            Hill, he would like to mention at this time a point which he would

                                discussion, scheduled for publication in the compilation on
                                regulation of armaments in a forthcoming volume of <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Foreign Relations</hi>.</note> because it was related to the
                            disarmament problem. His point, said Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>, related to the prospect that
                            the Soviet Union would in the near future possibly announce a unilateral
                            reduction in the conventional armed forces of the Soviet Union. In the
                            course of their visit to London, <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                                >Bulganin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> had given the British fairly clear evidence
                            of the Soviet intention to make some such spectacular announcement,
                            possibly involving a cut of 1,000,000 in the number of men in the Soviet
                            armed forces. Some consideration had been given to this possibility in
                            the course of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> discussions. The
                            British, for instance, had indicated that they might have to respond, in
                            some degree at least, to such a Soviet move if it occurred. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH1">Von Brentano</persName>, the German Foreign
                            Minister, had stressed the adverse effect of such a Soviet announcement
                            on the Federal Republic’s rearmament program. Specifically, the Soviet
                            move fight force the Germans to limit the period of service of the
                            soldiers in their new army to twelve months rather than to the eighteen
                            months which <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName> wanted.
                            Over and beyond these difficulties, such a Soviet move would create a
                            strong tendency for all the other continental <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> powers to twelve months. In general, a Soviet
                            unilateral reduction of its forces would tend to strengthen neutralism
                            and pacifism in Germany. There was no doubt in Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>’ mind that any Soviet move in
                            this area would be focused on the German situation, with the objective
                            of upsetting Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s
                            rearmament program.</p>
                        <p>Parenthetically, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>
                            said that he had the impression that Chancellor <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> was showing some of the signs
                            of age and illness. He appeared a bit cranky and difficult, and given to
                            antagonizing unnecessarily the people with whom he came into contact.
                            Accordingly, the situation was not running as smoothly in Germany as it
                            had in the past, when Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                                >Adenauer</persName> was in full possession of his strength. In any
                            event, the military situation, which the Foreign Ministers were not
                            supposed to be discussing directly, was of such a nature as to underline
                            the dangers and difficulties we would face in maintaining the vigor and
                            effectiveness of the military alliance of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> nations. In Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName>’ view, this made it all the more important to
                            strenghten the non-military aspects of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>When Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> had
                            concluded his report, the President wondered why the continental <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> powers expected the United States and
                            Great Britain to enforce a period of 24 months’ service for <pb n="80"
                                xml:id="pg_80" facs="0108"/>their military personnel stationed in
                            Germany, if the other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> powers
                            reduced their period to twelve months.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said that he had
                            rather recently himself talked to Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                                >Adenauer</persName> and to the German Defense Minister. The
                            Chancellor had told him that the length of service for troops in the new
                            German Army would depend on the justification of the Defense Minister,
                            who had in turn repeated firmly that this period would extend for 18
                            months. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> was
                            therefore at a loss to understand the apparent change in the German
                            point of view.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> replied that
                            whatever had been said earlier to <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von
                                Brentano</persName> had informed him no later than last Thursday
                            that there was no chance of inducing the German Parliament to accept a
                            period of 18 months’ service for the German recruits.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d30fn3">This May 3 discussion between <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName> is summarized in <gloss
                                    target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 10, May 4, scheduled for
                                publication in a forthcoming volume of <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                                    Relations</hi>.</note> The issue had found the lines drawn on a
                            strict party basis, and the proposal for an 18-month period could never
                            be got through the upper house of the German Parliament. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> repeated that the
                            German Defense Minister had not seemed the least concerned about this
                            problem, despite the fact that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJB1"
                                >Conant</persName> had questioned him very closely on the subject.
                            Moreover, said <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>,
                            Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> seemed very
                            well and healthy to him.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> then warned that
                            the expected Soviet announcement might well include a statement that all
                            Soviet forces in East Germany would be removed. This was part of the
                            British “educated guess” as to the contents of the Soviet announcement.
                            In any event, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>
                            believed that Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>
                            and the President’s Special Committee on Disarmament Problems should now
                            be asked to give the most urgent consideration to the nature of the U.S.
                            response to the Soviet announcement. We must not be caught flat-footed
                            when the Soviets made their move.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said that if the
                            Secretary of State so desired, he would be glad to undertake
                            consideration of this problem. Indeed he had already talked to Under
                            Secretary <persName>Hoover</persName> about the matter.</p>
                        <p>Apropos of the likelihood that the Soviets would announce a unilateral
                            reduction of 1,000,000 men, the President commented that after all the
                            Soviets would be doing nothing in the world, in making such a reduction,
                            except to imitate what this Government had done earlier in connection
                            with its formulation of the so-called “new look strategy”. Agreeing with
                            the President, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>
                            further pointed out the heavy demands on manpower in the Soviet Union
                            and the need of the Soviets to put more people into industry and
                            especially <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0109"/>into agriculture. This
                            would certainly be a factor in inducing them to cut the level of their
                            armed forces.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he believed
                            that such a Soviet unilateral cut would mark a definite change in the
                            policy of the USSR, though the purpose behind the move was a different
                            matter. In any event, of recent months the Soviets were trying to “mark
                            down” their war talk. This was in the right direction, even though we
                            did not clearly know the motives behind the change. It was certainly
                            significant that the Soviets had not put on much of a military display
                            at the recent May Day ceremonies. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName> reminded the Council that there had been a fly-by
                            of 20 Bisons in the preparation for the May Day celebration.</p>
                        <p>After further discussion of this matter, the President counselled that we
                            should do a lot of hard thinking on the meaning behind the anticipated
                            Soviet move, and he indicated his agreement with the assignment of
                            responsibility to Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1"
                                >Stassen</persName> for preparation of a U.S. response to such a
                            move. Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> should
                            have the help of anyone he felt he needed to call upon for this
                            task.</p>
                        <p>Thereafter, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>
                            informed the Council of the widespread inclination among our <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies to downgrade in importance the
                            role of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> ground forces because
                            of their conviction that, at least in the initial phases of a future
                            general war, the role of air atomic power would be crucial and ground
                            forces would not have a very important part. On the basis of this
                            reasoning they deduced that there was not much point in developing and
                            maintaining large ground forces. This sentiment was strengthened by the
                            fact that the Russians, while perhaps reducing the total level of their
                            armed forces, were selectively strengthening these forces, particularly
                            in terms of nuclear armament. Since our <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> allies do not have nuclear armament of their own, this
                            fact contributed to the general feeling of discouragement. Finally, as a
                            last discouraging note, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName> commented on the current struggle to secure
                            adequate German financial support for <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> forces based on West German territory.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> observed that
                            these problems were the same that we have been facing for over a year’s
                            time, although they were now entering a more intense phase. We would be
                            faced with a very serious problem if the Soviet Union really does
                            undertake a unilateral reduction in the level of its armed forces.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> referred to the
                            difficulties he had experienced in recent days in defending the Defense
                            Department programs before Congressional committees, which were critical
                            of the adequacy of these programs. He complained that the American
                            people and the members of Congress were engaged in comparing our present
                            military position with the military position the Soviet Union would have
                                <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0110"/>in the year 1960. Of course,
                            for security reasons we were in no position to reveal to the critics the
                            nature of our program for a military build-up between now and 1960.</p>
                        <p>Apropos of further comment by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> on the effects of the recent Soviet economic
                            offensive, particularly as it related to the underdeveloped nations,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> cited with some
                            amusement the situation in Rangoon. The entire harbor of Rangoon and all
                            the docks were choked with cement sent to Burma from the Soviet bloc and
                            which the Burmese had not the slightest idea what to do with. Despite
                            the amusing aspects of the matter, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName> repeated his very serious concern about the
                            Soviet tactics and the difficulty we were experiencing in competing with
                            them.</p>
                        <p>The President admitted that it was a serious problem, but it was in a
                            certain sense a recent manifestation of an age-old problem—namely, the
                            disadvantages which a democracy faced in trying to compete with a
                            dictatorship, which could change its tactics with no more than a
                            moment’s notice. Look at Stalin. A year ago he had been a saint, and now
                            he was a devil.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said he
                            disagreed with the President’s statement that dictatorships could change
                            their tactics and policy with impunity and very little notice. They
                            really couldn’t change over in a minute, and we should not be too
                            worried. After all, American businessmen did not get very excited about
                            a competitor until that competitor really began to bite into their
                            market.</p>
                        <p>Speaking forcefully, the President looked at Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> and said there was one hell of
                            a difference between what the Soviets were doing and business practice.
                            The Soviets were engaged in the great game of international politics,
                            and in that game they didn’t have to show a cent of financial profit.
                            Nevertheless, continued the President, it was hard to explain what
                            advantage the Russians thought they were going to get from the
                            indefinite building up of their war machine. After this war machine got
                            to be a certain size and could do what was required, a further build-up
                            seemed to be sheer waste. The President also expressed great concern
                            about the progress made by the Soviets in their economic offensive to
                            secure the allegiance of the uncommitted and underdeveloped nations. He
                            wondered whether we were going to wake up some morning and find what
                            Egypt, for instance, had slipped behind the Iron Curtain.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> pointed out with
                            emphasis that the delivery of Soviet bloc military supplies to Egypt
                            moved a lot faster than any munitions which we shipped to foreign
                            nations friendly to us. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> replied that we could provide these shipments
                            just as rapidly as the Soviets did if we really wanted to do so. If that
                            was the case, said the President, we certainly didn’t seem to want
                            to.</p>
                        <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0111"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> invited a
                            comparison of the speed with which we delivered it to Egypt. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> replied that no one
                            could tell him that we could not deliver $100 million worth of military
                            materiel to Pakistan in very short order if we really wanted to.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> then asked
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> why in this case
                            the Defense Department had not made rapid delivery to Pakistan.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> was unable to
                            explain clearly the facts of the situation, but reiterated his
                            conviction that prompt deliveries could be made by the Defense
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>The President pointed out that of course the United States had to move
                            more cautiously than the Soviet Union in order to avoid antagonizing
                            people. The Soviets did not have to give a thought to the problem of
                            domestic political support. In a life-and-death struggle, democracy
                            would prove itself superior to dictatorship, but in situations short of
                            such a struggle, dictatorship has many advantages over democracy.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that in any
                            event the Defense Department would live up to the expectations and
                            desires of the Secretary of State. The President pointed out further
                            difficulties which afflicted our military assistance program, and the
                            length of time required by the budget process, the pipeline, and the
                            rest. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> agreed
                            with the reality of all these difficulties, but said that if we really
                            needed to get matériel to one of our allies, such as Pakistan, such
                            matériel could be promptly taken out of the stockpile for the U.S. armed
                            services if the President so desired. If Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> were given authority by the
                            President, he would be able to send promptly whatever it was thought
                            desirable to send. The President said that he doubted if he could
                            legally give such authority to the Secretary of Defense. In reply,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> cited the speed
                            with which military equipment had been sent to Formosa at a time when it
                            seemed likely that the island would be attacked by the Chinese
                            Communists.</p>
                        <p>The President remarked that this was a unique situation, where Congress
                            had provided the requisite authority.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                            said that he was obliged to admit that the carrying out of the military
                            assistance program had been in past years the most poorly organized
                            aspect of the business of the Defense Department. He desired and
                            expected Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> to get
                            this job done more efficiently than had been the case in the past. A
                            major difficulty derived from the fact that, from the point of view of
                            the military services, foreign assistance came last in terms of priority
                            to the implementation of our military assistance program.</p>
                        <p>The President concluded the discussion of the agenda item by stating that
                            it was not enough for the National Security Council to meet once a week
                            to discuss this vital subject. The problem of foreign <pb n="84"
                                xml:id="pg_84" facs="0112"/>assistance should be constantly studied
                            at all times by the responsible departments. Moreover, it would be
                            desirable to bring in outside people—businessmen, educators, and others
                            to assist in helping to solve the problem.</p>
                        <p>At the end of this discussion, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName> left the Cabinet Room, and his place at the table

                            Secretary said that the U.S. Government had now formulated its views on
                            the matter, and he handed <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir
                                Roger</persName> a memorandum setting forth those views, which
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> read.<note n="3"

                            felt that the British proposal was too spectacular and would cause
                            public opinion to feel that a serious crisis exists. The Secretary said
                            that we felt it was much better to start from the bottom, as it were,
                            with the military studies now in process.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> commented that the idea
                            of the British Government had been not to get this matter in the first
                            instance into military channels, which the British felt might not
                            produce the desired results, but rather that it should be dealt with
                            first at a political level.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he had had a long talk on this matter with <persName

                                files.</note> The Secretary said that he thought it would be
                            possible to bring political considerations to the forefront and to make
                            them known to the military authorities in an appropriate way. The
                            Secretary said he did not feel that a Ministerial meeting, which was
                            open to all of the objections set forth in the U.S. memorandum, was
                            needed for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that he felt that political views could be
                            presented informally to the military. He felt certain that if our
                            Governments indicate to the military authorities what is wanted, the
                            latter will cooperate.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> said that he was glad
                            to have the Secretary’s views on this point and that he would direct

                        <p>The Secretary went on to say that he had stressed to <persName

                                corresp="#p_GGAM1">General Gruenther</persName> was in full
                            agreement, that the military posture in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> must not be allowed to fall apart, but must evolve to

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> said that, as regards
                            the timing foreseen in the U.S. memorandum, it seemed to him to be too
                            slow. He remarked that he had already told London that a July meeting
                            was out of the question. <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir
                                Roger</persName> inquired what was meant by the phrase “early
                            autumn”. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TBELIII1">Timmons</persName> said
                            that he felt it was difficult to be more precise at this time, until the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military commanders had had an
                            opportunity to consider the state of the various studies now in process,
                            and to indicate when it might be feasible to complete such studies.<note
                                n="5" xml:id="d32fn5">None of these studies under reference has been
                                found in Department of State files. Presumably they are the ones
                                referred to in paragraphs 3 and 5 of the attached memorandum.</note>
                            The Secretary said he thought “early autumn” would not be before the
                            latter part of September.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> said that on this
                            schedule it did not appear that there could be any consideration by the
                            Council before November, which he felt certain was “too late” for
                            London. He went on to say that the British Government does not feel the
                            situation can be allowed to go along until December. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> then said he felt he should
                            say no more at this time on the question of timing. He would report at
                            once to London the U.S. views, as set forth in the memorandum. He then
                            did add, however, that the U.S. reply does not correspond to the “more
                            radical” views of the British Government. He said that it could, of
                            course, be said that the procedure referred to in the U.S. memorandum
                            was a possible way of facing the problem, particularly if the military
                            authorities are ready to respond to political guidance given in an
                            informal manner. The Secretary wondered if it would not be possible to
                            have an informal meeting between the political authorities of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UKG1">U.K.</gloss>, the U.S., and France, and their
                            military representatives on the Standing Group, to talk over the whole
                            situation toward the end of July or in early August. This could provide
                            an opportunity for giving the military authorities informal political
                            guidance.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary emphasized how imperative it is to avoid public discussion
                            of a proposed review of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> strategy
                            while the mutual security legislation is before the Congress. He spoke
                            of the encouraging developments with respect to this legislation
                            yesterday, but reminded <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir

                            fully in mind and had strongly emphasized it to London.</p>

                                    would be produced by a new directive to the military authorities

                                <item>The United States Government attaches the highest importance
                                    to avoiding publicity on these matters until the Council has
                                    determined appropriate action that could be taken with respect
                                    thereto. The question of the level and type of forces required
                                    to maintain the deterrent and to provide defense in the event of
                                    aggression is a military and political question of great
                                    complexity. Premature disclosure of the fact that a review is
                                    being undertaken might, in addition to the considerations
                                    mentioned above, be misleading as to the outcome of such a
                                    study. In addition, the timing of the disclosure of such studies
                                    and of any reductions that might result therefrom should receive
                                    most careful consideration in light of the status of relations
                                    with the USSR, particularly the negotiations on disarmament and
                                    related matters.</item>

                        <p>The Secretary said he recognized the urgency which the British attached
                            to receiving some word from us regarding their proposal to review <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> strategy, looking to a reduction in
                            conventional forces, and therefore had discussed this matter with the
                            President when he saw him this morning.<note n="2" xml:id="d33fn2">The

                            President is prepared to bring our thinking on this subject to a head
                            during the first fortnight in August so that we would be in a position
                            to discuss this problem with the British about the middle of August,
                            with a view to proceeding thereafter as we might mutually agree to some
                            broader exchange of views with other <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> powers. He added that part of the problem was whether
                            we could deal with the British proposal until such time as we had
                            completed our own thinking in some detail regarding our own problem of
                            the level and composition of US forces. However, in view of the urgency
                            which the British attached to this problem, the President felt that we
                            need not complete in detail our study of all aspects of our own problem
                            before talking with the British. To summarize, the Secretary said, we
                            will try to be in shape to hold discussions with Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> about mid-August.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> expressed deep
                            appreciation and said this news would be most welcome to his Government.
                            He then made reference to the article in the <hi rend="italic">New York
                                Times</hi> this morning indicating that <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Admiral Radford</persName> was seeking an 800,000-man cut in the US

                                    >New York Times</hi>, July 13, 1956, p. 1.</note> The Secretary
                            said it was a terrible article and was obviously based on speculation
                            coupled with some vague knowledge that studies of various assumptions
                            and possibilities were in progress in the Pentagon. The Secretary
                            explained that in approaching the problem of our own forces a number of
                            teams were set up to dela with different assumptions and that his was
                            simply a part of the normal planning cycle. The Secretary thought he
                            could assure <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> that
                            nothing like what was portrayed in the article would emerge when the
                            final solution was arrived at.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> said that one of the
                            problems about studying these matters was leaks, and that London had
                            certainly been guilty of some during planning duties, although he
                            thought the situation had improved in the last three weeks to <persName

                            leaks. The Secretary agreed that leaks create much confusion and said
                            that while we had been unhappy about some of the stories coming out of
                            London, we ourselves were now guilty. However, a statement was issued
                            this afternoon by the Department of Defense to explain the situation and
                            to correct the impressions created by the New York Times article<note

                                must command public confidence if its authority is to be

                            <item>As it seems to me the strategic situation has been evolving since
                                the development of the thermo-nuclear weapon. Two new factors have
                                now been introduced. First, both sides now stand possessed of this
                                weapon, and each now realises the devastation which its use would
                                involve. Second, and perhaps as important, public opinion throughout
                                the democracies has begun to realise that the danger of major war
                                has for this reason receded and that the nature of such a war, if it
                                came, would be very different from anything we have <pb n="91"
                                    xml:id="pg_91" facs="0119"/>known hitherto. As this
                                understanding deepens there is bound to be a growing reluctance,
                                among the peoples of the free world, to accept the social and human
                                sacrifices required for the maintenance of large forces of the
                                conventional pattern.</item>

                            <item>It can be argued that even the Russians are adjusting the balance
                                of their resources. They are certainly doing everything they can to
                                develop the most up-to-date weapons and the means of delivering
                                them. From this it is pretty clear that they believe in the power of
                                the deterrent. Having taken that decision they have decided, it
                                seems to me, to increase their labour force for industrial expansion
                                and correspondingly to reduce their conventional military forces.
                                They are skillfully making the maximum propaganda use of this
                                decision.</item>

                            <item>We have surely to take account of these new elements in the
                                situation. Some no doubt will say that these considerations lead to
                                the logical conclusion that you, at any rate, and perhaps we, should
                                fall back on a peripheral defense. This is not my view. I feel sure
                                it would not be yours. The maintenance of independence and freedom
                                in Western Europe is essential to any policy designed to preserve
                                our free way of life in the world. You know, better than anyone, how
                                the increasing military strength of the North Atlantic Alliance
                                helped to build up political stability in Western Europe, for you
                                did it. It was the forces in being under <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                    >NATO</gloss> Command, and particularly the presence of United
                                States and British forces in Europe, that gave confidence and
                                courage to those who were ready to resist political encroachment by
                                Communism in Europe. Or to put it another way: the political
                                cohesion of the Western European countries in resisting the internal
                                threat of Communism was inspired by growing confidence in the
                                military side of the Alliance. The political need to maintain the
                                solidarity of the European countries is as strong as ever. For this
                                purpose, even if for no other, it would still be important that some
                                United States and British forces should remain on the ground in
                                Europe under <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Command.</item>

                            <item>The military purpose for which these forces are now required are,
                                however, different from those on which the military policy of <gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was first framed. It was
                                originally designed to meet the threat of a Soviet land invasion,
                                and its pattern was established before the advent of the nuclear
                                weapon. Today, the situation is changing. It is on the
                                thermo-nuclear bomb and atomic weapons that we now rely, not only to
                                deter aggression, but to deal with aggression if it should be
                                launched. A “shield” of conventional forces is still required; but
                                it is no longer our principal military protection. Need it be
                                capable of fighting a major land battle? Its primary military
                                function seems now to be to deal with any local infiltration, to
                                prevent external intimidation and to enable aggression to be
                                identified as such. It may be that it should also be capable of
                                imposing some delay on the progress of a <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92"

                                of the thermo-nuclear retaliation which would be launched against

                            <item>The application of this concept would, I think, involve
                                significant changes in the shape and size of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces, and possibly in their
                                deployment. It would certainly have a profound effect on existing
                                plans for reserve forces and for logistic support. I believe that it
                                could lead to a reduction in the numbers of conventional forces
                                stationed in Germany—though I should not wish such a reduction to be
                                carried below the levels necessary to serve the political objectives
                                outlined in paragraph 5 above. A reappraisal of the military policy
                                of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> along these lines is, I
                                believe, necessary and urgent. It is necessary on its merits. It is
                                urgent because we believe that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                                will not continue to command public confidence unless it shows its
                                ability to adjust its policies to accord with changing circumstances
                                and, as I have said, I doubt whether the peoples of the free world
                                will be willing to go on bearing the heavy burden of defense
                                programmes unless they are satisfied that these are directed
                                realistically towards the new situation.</item>

                                President favored a reduction and wrote as follows: “The President
                                said that he was speaking about units reduced in size and overhead
                                but with equivalent strength through increased fire-power as a

                                abandoning them. With this thought, the President expressed hearty
                                agreement, and pointed out that the entire responsibility for German
                                defense could not be construed to be our own.” <persName

                                further work on ways and means of reducing the size of our forces
                                without reducing strength, by the use of tactical improvements in
                                weapons, and effort should likewise be made to reduce the number of

                            that this would have to be studied very carefully as the effectiveness
                            of the units would of course be reduced and many technical questions
                            regarding handling of equipment would be raised. <persName

                            noncommittal. There was some conversation about the possibility of
                            reducing the divisional strength by “X” number of thousands and the
                            possibility that this might amount to as much as 5 to 10,000 based on a
                            divisional slice of 40,000. There was no agreement on this point.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GGAM1">General Gruenther</persName> referred
                            to an extensive study which is being made by the Army involving, he

                        <p>The meeting was concerned with views relating to any reduction of U.S.
                            force strength in Europe, and possible statements to <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> regarding such reduction and related
                            matters, including questions of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            strategy raised by the British and French.</p>
                        <p>The President opened by saying that he felt very definitely that we
                            cannot take divisions out of Europe at this time. The effect on
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> would be unacceptably
                            damaging. He could not agree with a Defense position contemplating such
                                reductions,<note n="2" xml:id="d38fn2">Reference is presumably to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s memorandum for
                                the President entitled “United States Position on the Review of
                                    <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Strategy and Force
                                Levels.” See <ref target="#d37fn1">footnote 1, <hi rend="italic"
                                        >supra</hi></ref>.</note> and statements to this effect at
                            this time. He recalled that he had always supported the idea of reducing
                            our forces after the initial period of crisis was over—he had always
                            considered that they had been sent over to add strength temporarily
                            while European forces were developed. Referring to recent reference
                            indicating that Senator <persName corresp="#p_GWF1">George</persName>
                            had implied a sixth division might be established in Europe out of
                            manpower saved through streamlining, he indicated that these comments
                            seemed to reflect a misunderstanding. He did not plan to go above five
                            divisions, but he did feel that the strength should be maintained at
                            five divisions.</p>
                        <p>The President went on to say that we must make use of every art of
                            statecraft to bring the Europeans to an understanding of our way of
                            thinking regarding our forces there, but for the moment we <pb n="100"
                                xml:id="pg_100" facs="0128"/>could not remove major units. He felt
                            we should examine closely all of our other high priority programs. He
                            mentioned the earth satellite, initially estimated to cost $22 million,
                            now at $60 million, with this latter figure “only a beginning.” He noted
                            that we had not yet dropped any of the four lines of development of
                            ballistic missiles. (Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1"
                                >Robertson</persName> pointed out the figure is now five.) He
                            referred to the major programs of the Air, the Navy, ground forces, and
                            Marines, and thought we should look them all over.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said that to
                            get within a reasonable budgetary range, it appears we must be ready to
                            go down to a strength of about 2.6 million. Careful studies are being
                            made with the aim of cutting overhead. The President broke in to say he
                            agreed strongly on cutting overhead, and particularly on cutting down
                            the strength of the Army division. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said that even if we were to
                            cut out 4,000 men per division in Europe, and make reductions in
                            administrative overhead and support, plus reductions in tactical air
                            strength, and reduction in families accordingly, it will be hard to find
                            the needed savings. He said he wants to keep digging. The President said
                            he has felt since the first atom bomb was dropped that the infantry
                            division should be substantially cut; it shouldn’t be over 12,000 men.
                            He felt that support echelons could be cut down (not incorporating all
                            of the units cut out of the division) since it would be possible to
                            deploy some support units in time of war.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> thought we
                            should tell our allies what we are doing. Information would, in any
                            event, leak out during the budget hearings.</p>
                        <p>The President said he had always insisted that the Europeans should
                            develop ground forces to replace ours. Also he had supported offshore
                            procurement so that they would develop an ability to produce capital
                            equipment and not depend entirely on us. As events developed in the
                            past, however, there was always an unwillingness to put the matter
                            squarely to the Europeans and now it has become extremely difficult.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said that the
                            trends discussed in the Defense paper<note n="3" xml:id="d38fn3"
                                >Reference is to <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s
                                memorandum cited in <ref target="#d38fn2">footnote 2</ref>
                                above.</note> are well reflected in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> papers going back all the way to 1950. It is apparent
                            that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> has not read these
                            papers. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> referred
                            to the problem of cutting off spare parts. Each time this has been
                            proposed, it has been necessary to postpone this action.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> said that we must
                            be fairly specific in our ideas very soon, because the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council will be taking this matter
                            up. He proceeded to a discussion of the points in Section II of his
                            memorandum to the President dated October 1, 1956.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d38fn4"><ref target="#d37"><hi rend="italic"
                                    >Supra</hi></ref>.</note> There was general <pb n="101"
                                xml:id="pg_101" facs="0129"/>agreement on the desirability of
                            streamlining our forces in Europe, and paragraph 3 of the Secretary’s
                            memo was revised to meet the views of the Defense representatives.</p>
                        <p>There was next discussion of paragraph 2 which also resulted in some
                            revision to make it acceptable to the whole group. In the discussion,
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said the
                            original version overstated the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss>
                            position. They were simply adopting the new look, which we had already
                            adopted. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>
                            indicated that it was one thing for us to rely on the new look, not
                            being subject to insurrectionary or conventional attack as the Europeans
                            are, and it is something else to propose it for the Europeans. … The
                            President confirmed that we have simply said that we will proceed with
                            plans and preparations on the basis that, if the Soviets invade, atomic
                            weapons would be used.</p>
                        <p>The President next suggested that we should send someone to discuss these
                            matters with <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>, whose
                            understanding of the problem is apparently incomplete and possibly in
                            error in some respects. An explanation should be given as to how we plan
                            to use atomic weapons. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> agreed that this would be useful and said he
                            would like to do it himself sometime. The President thought it might be
                            well to have the discussion before <persName corresp="#p_GGAM1">General
                                Gruenther</persName> comes back since he has <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s confidence.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> next pointed out
                            the tremendous increase in the firepower of military units that has
                            occurred over the last several years—with one division having a strength
                            much greater than many divisions had in the past. A good deal of cutting
                            down could be considered. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1"
                                >Robertson</persName> suggested that streamlining would not go far
                            enough; further cuts would be required. The President thought that
                            substantial savings could be found through streamlining, but that
                            reduction in number of divisions does not look practicable at this
                            time.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> referred to
                            paragraph 10 of the Secretary’s memo, and indicated he pre-judged the
                            matter on which a position had not yet been developed in the U.S.
                            Government. The Secretary and the President pointed out that the
                            proposal seemed to go beyond the scope of the treaty and its legislative
                            history. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said
                            the Chiefs see some merit in the proposal. It is now up for
                            consideration in a Standing Group paper, and the United States has
                            reserved its position in the matter. The President indicated that the
                            matter could be brought up for consideration, including consideration of
                            possible treaty revision, and suggested an amendment which would leave
                            the matter open for this purpose. No further objections <pb n="102"
                                xml:id="pg_102" facs="0130"/>were indicated to the outline of
                            presentation set forth in the Secretary’s memorandum.</p>

                        <p>On October 12, the Department of State handed to the British Embassy in
                            Washington a memorandum which outlined its reaction to the principal
                            points of substance in the British draft Political Directive and
                            expressed the hope that the views of the United States Government would
                            be considered in the preparation of the final draft. (Memorandum of
                            October 9; Department of State, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MEM1"

                            Government presented their proposed <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> Political Directive to the North Atlantic Council on
                            October 19. In his statement to the Council that day, Representative
                                <persName corresp="#p_PGW1">Perkins</persName> stated that while the
                            United States Government did not think it was possible to prepare a new
                            overall <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> force plan in time for
                            action in December, it believed that the first task of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was to reach a firm understanding on
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> strategy. Such an
                            understanding would in turn permit a careful reexamination of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> force plans. He also stated that the
                            United States had no plans for withdrawing any divisions from Europe at

                            Atlantic Council agreed to Canada’s suggestion that the final Directive
                            be composed of two separate parts: 1) the conclusion of the Soviet
                            trends paper which was an analysis of Soviet intentions, and 2) a brief
                            and clear guidance for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military
                            authorities. The Council also agreed that a working group which included

                            drafting a directive along the lines suggested by Canada. (<gloss

                            cooperation among the Allies, and would draw up a new directive through
                            their military representatives which would “take into account both the

                            December 15, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> issued a

                                <item>Recent actions of Soviets in Hungary and Middle East have
                                    shown they are as brutal as ever and have dissipated the

                                <item>The Middle East crisis must be considered in context of
                                    relations with the less developed nations which is so important
                                    for West. Regarding the British and French action in Egypt he
                                    expressed shock and surprise at lack of consultation and
                                    disregard of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> treaty and
                                        <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UN</gloss> Charter. The British and
                                    French action could only harm relations with the Afro-Asian
                                    nations and Western influence there. He had no desire for
                                    recriminations but felt frank discussion of the crisis was
                                    essential for health of the Alliance. He would talk about
                                    question of consultation later under the report of Three Wise

                                <item>Both the crisis in Hungary and Middle East shed light on
                                    Soviet policy. As Soviet trends paper shows, Soviet policy, like
                                    ours, has been influenced by the atomic factor and danger of
                                    global war. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>

                                    irrational acts we should assume that Soviets still want to
                                    avoid war even though hostile. Hence Soviet effort is not early
                                    military aggression but longer range growth in power and
                                    economic penetration. The <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                                    paper on Soviet growth may overstate somewhat but still shows
                                    that their rate of growth will be rapid and will make them
                                    strong competitor in world markets within decade or so.</item>

                                <item>Hungary has shown how strong is popular opposition to Soviet
                                    domination in satellites. By their statement of October 30
                                    Soviets recognized the strong nationalist feelings and were
                                    prepared to make concessions so long as East European nations
                                    remain within Soviet bloc. They have shown they are ready to use

                                    defections from bloc. The sharp shift in their actions in
                                    Hungary which occurred when Nagy demanded free elections and
                                    renounced the Warsaw Pact shows where they draw the line.</item>

                                <item>These events are likely to have further effects in satellites
                                    which could cause pressures for West to intervene with the
                                    probability of a direct Soviet response and World War III.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that
                                    Soviets would fight for Soviet Union and Warsaw members and that
                                    warning should not go unheeded. The West should not intervene in
                                    such a case. If that is our policy we should avoid encouraging
                                    satellite people toward violent uprisings and stress instead
                                    evolutionary change. The BBC has followed such a restrained
                                    policy. Thus in Poland we should encourage gradual evolution,
                                    not forceful change. Members should discuss issue.</item>

                                <item>In Hungary our objective should be free elections. Certainly
                                    we should not encourage the present government or appear to
                                    condone its actions but we should avoid any concerted break and
                                    seek to maintain our missions in Belgrade so as to keep open
                                    that channel. There is no need to change our policy toward the
                                    other satellites. We can hope by fostering exchanges to
                                    encourage critical attitude among intelligentsia. Britain
                                    intends to concentrate on Czechoslovakia for the present.</item>

                                        advisers and troops in Eastern Europe. In discussing the
                                        situation in Hungary, it stated a counterrevolutionary

                                    a doctrinal battle was in process and doubted whether

                                <item>We should recognize the continuing hostility of USSR and

                                    facing. They have had recent reports of discontent among
                                    students, intelligentsia, and even some army officers which may
                                    be important but we should not indulge in wishful thinking. Our
                                    aim should be to foster growth of critical faculty in Soviet
                                    Union and satellites. Outside we can use the recent events to
                                    destroy the myth that history is on Soviet side or that
                                    Communism is the wave of the future. This should be especially

                                        <item>In the light of this situation it is hard to describe
                                            the Israeli action as aggression, especially when Egypt,
                                            Syria, and Jordan formed a combined command with the
                                            avowed purpose of destroying Israel. France and Britain
                                            intervened in good faith to stop the spread of the war
                                            and succeeded in doing so. Before the ultimatum the
                                            other Arabs had been ordered to join. Thus there is more

                                inflicts. Both morality and expediency now reject deliberate resort

                                    devices, we must all bear in mind that existence of double

                                    Also it bears more heavily upon some more than upon others. US
                                    feels however that we do not need to contemplate that this
                                    double standard will go on forever. We convinced that free
                                    nations should continue to conform to high standards of conduct
                                    which are prescribed by Charter and which indeed were written
                                    into Charter primarily at their behest as expressing ideals
                                    their peoples. They are Article 1 of our Treaty.</p>
                                <p>We believe impact this conduct will become steadily greater and
                                        <gloss target="#t_Sov1">Sov</gloss> despotism will become

                                    pursue with resolution course we have set before ourselves, we
                                    can expect it to prevail and that dangerous division of world
                                    will draw to end.</p>

                                    particularly if each nation does its utmost to secure justice
                                    for others even where its own interests are not directly
                                    involved. There are deficiencies in this respect. Much can be
                                    done by cooperation and resourcefulness. Also we should
                                    recognize fact that since burdens of double standard do not fall
                                    equally upon all free nations, consideration for each other is
                                    not charity. US has in past tried to act in accordance with this
                                    principle, and I hope we shall continue do so for

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> (Belgium) then spoke. Re
                            Soviet policy, he said fact gradually emerging that de-Stalinization has
                            produced no change in basic Soviet policy. He said judging by recent
                            events Yugoslav-Soviet rapprochement is more apparent than real. Basic
                            intent of Soviet policy is to make problems facing Western world more
                            difficult. While Soviet Government does not want to push matters far
                            enough <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0145"/>to run risk of World War
                            III, latter might occur as result of miscalculation. In this connection
                            he said most dangerous incidents might occur in East Germany. Soviets
                            have done nothing to help Middle East crisis but, to contrary, have done
                            all they can to make solution more difficult. <persName

                                >Spaak</persName> wondered if basis for such disturbances did not
                            result from internal situation. He said Soviet boast of great economic
                            power is bluff and Western world should not be taken in by this. He felt
                            Soviets experiencing much greater difficulty internally than we had
                            thought.</p>
                        <p>In underdeveloped countries Soviet deeds have not lived up to Soviet
                            promises. He thought Western nations should have generally agreed policy
                            toward Asian and African countries and described as false concept idea
                            that we should necessarily help all such countries regardless of their
                            feelings toward West. He opposed giving aid to hostile countries which,
                            he said, would not in any case show gratitude. They take attitude that
                            they have the right to such aid and West could reap more spectacular
                            results by limiting aid to countries favoring Western policies.</p>
                        <p>Recent rift in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> has caused
                            considerable disillusionment. At very time that Three Wise Men were
                            formulating recommendations for coordinating policies, international
                            crisis broke in Middle East. He deplored fact smaller European countries
                            faced with problem of choosing between United Kingdom and France on one
                            hand and U.S. on other and described their positions as “most
                            difficult”. Unfortunately no one had thought of convening <gloss

                            said Anglo-French action in Egypt could have provoked chain reaction

                        <p>He then turned to United Nations. He said efforts made at first <gloss

                            there would not inspire any Western European representative with

                        <p>General Assembly is divided on political lines into intransigent majority
                            and minority. It is able to a certain extent to avert war but is
                            incapable of anything “concrete”. He cited unjust cases and denial of
                            right to smaller powers such as Israel and said, <gloss target="#t_UNO1"
                                >UN</gloss> only capable of taking action when series of
                            provocations brings countries to brink of war. He expressed great
                            pessimism regarding future of <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UN</gloss>.
                            Referring to “double standard” he said Soviet champions recommendations
                            of <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UN</gloss> in one part of world and takes no
                            notice of recommendations concerning another part. He asked how <gloss

                            properly.</p>
                        <p>He referred to <persName corresp="#p_LHM1">Lange</persName>’s remarks on
                            colonialism and warned against falling prey to idea that issue of
                            colonialism should govern decisions of Western countries. Under guise of
                            reaction against colonialism, treaties, alliances and human rights have
                            been violated by certain countries. As for dependent areas, it is not
                            question only of independence but of what such areas can do with
                            independence, and it would be capital mistake to urge full independence
                            for some areas such as Belgian Congo which is not prepared for such
                            status. No one believes in 19th century colonialism which must one day
                            be liquidated but there would be no advantage in making dependent areas
                            suddenly independent and responsible for solution of their own problems.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> closed by reaffirming
                            great importance of Atlantic Alliance and need for change in

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ATME1">Averoff</persName> (Greece) referred to

                            against overestimating Soviet economic capabilities. He said Soviets
                            have promised much but have given very little, although they exert great
                            influence even by mere promises. <persName corresp="#p_SDT1"

                            Greek Government rejected his offers and did not make them public for
                            fear of Greek public reaction in favor of Soviet. He said there has been
                            no change in Soviet foreign policy and <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> must continue its military and political defense
                            efforts. He described Hungarian tragedy as “re-awakening” for Western

                            and economic disruption there so serious it will lead to further

                            countries in that area undergoing fundamental evolution and are
                            awakening to status of individuality as nations. We must reckon with
                            this new nationalistic trend. Greece has special interest in Egypt
                            because of 200,000 compatriots residing there. Nevertheless, Greek
                            Government had rejected request for Soviet planes to overfly Greece en
                            route to Egypt. He believed Egyptian Government still wary of Soviet
                            despite its hostility toward West and willingness to profit from Soviet
                            assistance. He said immediate objective of all Western countries should
                            be to assure Arab-Israel peace and thus deprive Soviet Union of reason
                            for interference in area. He concluded by expressing concern for serious
                            economic difficulties confronting Greece and importance to Greece of
                            Cyprus problem which he intended to discuss later in meeting.</p>

                            Middle East crisis. In addition, Europe vitally concerned over
                            developments in Hungary which have made deep and lasting impression and
                            these developments, as well as those in Poland, are of far-reaching
                            significance for future. He agreed with Secretary <persName

                            loosed they cannot be stopped. He said East-West exchanges, now

                            and warned against lowering Western Iron Curtain.</p>
                        <p>Re Middle East crisis, he felt <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            should not dwell on what has passed. While Denmark disappointed in
                            French-British action, Danish Government has refrained from indulging in
                            public criticism. As for solution of Suez Canal problem, he expressed

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HHCS1">Hansen</persName> said that the importance

                            said earlier, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries must take

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_LJMAH1">Luns</persName> (Netherlands) referred to
                            increased political tensions between Soviet and West Europe as result of
                            brutal repression in Hungary and to increased tensions between West and
                            uncommitted nations of Asia and Africa. He deplored latter and said
                            unless we work to improve relations with these countries they would move
                            more and more into Soviet orbit. He advised increased technical
                            assistance on multilateral basis. He said widespread misery and
                            illiteracy in these countries is fertile soil for anti-Western actions
                            and sentiments. Today two words confuse men’s minds: 1) sovereignty and
                            2) colonialism. Newly independent nations set great store by former and
                            have exaggerated ideas re its meaning. Sooner they understand there are
                            always limits to sovereignty better off they will be. As for
                            colonialism, it would appear that anything Western nations do is
                            attributed to colonialism but nothing that Soviet state does is so
                            called. This myth should be exploded. U.S., for example, is well-known
                            champion of anti-colonialism but is no more exempt from criticism by
                            uncommitted nations than other Western European powers. While urging we
                            persist in seeking better relations with these countries, he warned
                            against trying to overbid Soviet Union in encouraging nationalistic and
                            anti-European trends and policies.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Middle East crisis and rift in Western Alliance,
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJMAH1">Luns</persName> said we must not
                            sacrifice future to past. We should make sure no such rift occurs again.
                            Whatever may be said re Anglo-French action, their motives could not be
                            described as dishonorable in any way. Britain and France were not
                            interested in any material gain or in threatening independence of Egypt,
                            fact which contrasts glaringly with brutal repression by Soviets in
                            Hungary.</p>
                        <p>Turning to <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UN</gloss>, <persName

                                target="#t_UNO1">UN</gloss> resolutions. He said they had right to
                            expect during stay of <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UN</gloss> force in Egypt
                            solution to three basic problems: Israel-Arab conflict, Arab refugee
                            problem and Suez Canal. <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UN</gloss> has duty to
                            take advantage of its new strength to cure illness itself and not merely
                            to treat symptoms. If we return to status quo ante <gloss
                                target="#t_UNO1">UN</gloss> prestige will be reduced and one more
                            failure chalked up on <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UN</gloss> record. He
                            lauded <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>’s realistic
                            appraisal of <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UN</gloss> and said high ideals of

                            Francisco have been perverted. <persName corresp="#p_LJMAH1"
                                >Luns</persName> termed <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            necessary to defense of West and said if its effectiveness is to be
                            increased, efforts in military field must be unrelenting and policies
                            must be coordinated by all members. Recent history teaches that
                            negotiating from position of strength is only way to deal with Soviet.
                            In military field he cautioned that reassessment should not be pretext
                            for avoiding responsibilities and commitments and spoke particularly of
                            maintaining level of U.S., British, Canadian forces on continent.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJMAH1">Luns</persName> concluded by
                            expressing hope that present frank exchange of views will bring about

                            he described as “occasional” and “permanent”. He described Suez crisis
                            as “occasional” problem and said that while he did not wish to fix
                            responsibility for crisis, he was obliged to emphasize serious situation
                            created, particularly with respect to rift created in <gloss

                            Alliance. He counseled <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members to
                            look to future and to work to establish mechanism which would help avoid
                            repetition of such situation. He said that danger for Western world had
                            increased and emphasized need for maintaining unity within the Alliance.
                            He praised Wise Men’s report as providing a basis for consultation, but
                            said that apart from consultative mechanism proposed, main thing
                            necessary for success of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is “will”
                            for common action. Future will depend on willingness of members to speak

                            Middle East, where Soviet Union is trying to create local disturbances
                            through subversive efforts, is where present danger lies. Soviet
                            penetration should be subject of study and guiding principles should be
                            established for handling situation. He felt that action should be taken

                            connection with Baghdad Pact deserves urgent study, and <persName

                            Greeks apparently hoped to solve this problem. He questioned Greek

                            for propaganda reasons or whether he proposed a settlement by <gloss

                            Greek-Yugoslav relations would indicate pact has taken on bilateral

                                Lloyd</persName> said that he understood this talk would deal with
                            our position with respect to Germany, in line with what he had indicated
                            on leaving Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                                yesterday.<note n="2" xml:id="d44fn2">At the conclusion of a

                                    >Lloyd</persName> had said that while the British intended to
                                keep four divisions in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, they
                                could not keep troops in Germany unless a way was found to reimburse
                                the British for this expense. To <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                    >Dulles</persName>’ question “Unless the Germans pay for it?”
                                    <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Lloyd</persName> replied, “Unless
                                someone pays for it.” (Memorandum of conversation, <gloss

                                    rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, CF 824)</note> There were two aspects
                            of the problem: (1) military organization and manpower and (2) financial
                            questions. The Chancellor would speak to the latter point.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said that the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> problem had to be approached from two
                            points of view: (1) what was right to do from the European point of view
                            and (2) how to finance it. On the second point, it was paradoxical that
                            we, who had come to Germany as occupying power, and are now there as
                            allies, have to bear a great burden, while the Germans have a good
                            economy, are the greatest commercial rivals to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss>, are without internal or external debt,
                            have no armed forces and no defense budget burdens. The <gloss
                                target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss>, after February, will have a critical
                            foreign exchange problem with respect to their troops in Germany.
                            Because of the strategic and tactical requirement for troops in Germany,
                            the situation is that there is a large <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124"
                                facs="0152"/>foreign exchange cost if the Commander in Chief
                            requires forces abroad, while there would be none if he said they could
                            be stationed at home.</p>
                        <p>Without discussing the military factors, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1"
                                >Macmillan</persName> said, the question was how to find the
                            wherewithal by some sort of pool or monetary arrangement. The location
                            of forces should not put a foreign exchange burden on the <gloss
                                target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> or the whole thing could break down, and
                            very quickly too, he added. We are therefore faced with two questions:
                            (1) what is the best approach to the military question and (2) what is
                            the best approach as to how to make the Germans contribute. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said the US had the
                            same problem and in addition had the problem of dependents, amounting to
                            some 250,000 people who required schools and so forth. Mr.
                                <persName>Head</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_UKG1"
                                >UK</gloss> had a similar problem together with the need for schools
                            and other facilities.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> asked whether the
                                <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> had discussed this problem at the
                                <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss> meeting yesterday.<note n="3"

                                corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> said they had discussed
                            it generally. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            said that the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> had in a way a
                            different sort of commitment than the US. The <gloss target="#t_UKG1"
                                >UK</gloss> had said that it would not withdraw forces against the
                            wishes of the Brussels Treaty Council.<note n="4" xml:id="d44fn4"
                                >Reference is to the consultative council established by the

                                Netherlands, and Luxembourg) of this 50-year alliance.</note> The
                            Secretary considered this a wise international pledge. The Secretary
                            thought the problem was primarily with Germany. He did not think the
                            Germans were playing a game because he has great faith in <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>; but the Germans do suggest
                            that if the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> and the US can run out on
                            their obligations, the Germans can also run out on their obligations
                            which are very moderate by comparison. He again inquired what had
                            happened in the <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss> meeting. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> said that
                            there had not been a discussion of specifics. He had told the <gloss
                                target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss> Council that the balance of payments
                            situation for the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> was very bad and
                            could not go on. He had received no reaction.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> then said that
                            on the military side the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> was
                            committed to have four divisions and a tactical air force, The size of

                                >UK</gloss> commitment. The <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss>
                            Divisions of 18,500 men is the largest in the world. The German Division
                            is about 10,500 men. If the fire power of the <gloss target="#t_UKG1"
                                >UK</gloss> Division were improved, <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1"
                                >SACEUR</gloss> might reconcile himself to a strength reduction. The
                            air force already has greater fire power. The problem is with the
                            soldiers. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> said
                            that the US is now arming <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0153"/>its
                            forces with atomic weapons and asked if the US had any plans along those
                            lines for the Germans.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> referred the
                            question to <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> who
                            said we did not have any such plans. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> remarked that the Germans could
                            not have atomic weapons under the Treaty. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that the Germans were
                            forbidden from making atomic weapons but were not forbidden by the
                            Treaty from buying them from the US.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> said that the
                            strategic concept contemplated that everyone should have an atomic
                            capability. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            responded that that was the implication of <gloss target="#t_MC1"
                                >MC</gloss> 48—that we should plan on the assumption that atomic
                            weapons would be used. This subject might come up under the agenda of
                            the Ministerial Meeting in connection with the Political Directive.
                            Present US legislation does not permit us to give atomic warheads to
                            others in peacetime. We can, in peacetime, give weapons which can
                            deliver atomic warheads. Mr. <persName>Head</persName> remarked that the
                                <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> was already buying the Corporal.
                            But, added Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, the
                            giving of warheads in peacetime is restricted. We are studying the
                            problem of increasing the capability to use such weapons. We are
                            prepared to make samples of weapons that can deliver atomic warheads
                            available for research and production. We are studying what can be done
                            under the present legislation with respect to training and use of atomic
                            weapons. In addition, the Secretary said, there are policy questions of
                            cost, strategy and so forth as to what is to be done.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that we do
                            not wish our capability to be so exclusively dependent on atomic weapons
                            that there is no measure of flexibility. We must have a measure of
                            flexibility although our main reliance must be on atomic weapons in the
                            event of major attack.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then asked to
                            what strength the US was cutting its divisional organization. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> replied that we were
                            cutting to about 12,000 for the infantry division from the old figure of
                            about 17–18,000. He said the process was slow.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Head</persName> said that there was a time lag for the
                                <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> with respect to availability of
                            atomic warheads. The <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> has lagged
                            behind on having atomic warheads available. It does not have this
                            increased fire power available to it now. The <gloss target="#t_UKG1"
                                >UK</gloss> must reduce manpower in order to balance costs if its
                            forces are to be armed with the best weapons available.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that there
                            were two problems, as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1"
                                >Macmillan</persName> had noted. First there was the question of
                            what is a sound strategic concept. The US felt that no unsound strategic
                            concept should be forced on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> to
                            meet financial problems. The US could not support the view that he
                            believed the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> had once suggested that
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should go entirely on a
                            “trip-wire” basis, nor <pb n="126" xml:id="pg_126" facs="0154"/>could
                            the US accept the idea that there was no need for substantial manpower
                            because any attack would set off massive retaliation and in that provide
                            a sufficient deterrent. While in about 90% of the possible situations
                            nuclear retaliation would cover the situation, there are, he said,
                            particularly with respect to the partitioning of Germany and perhaps
                            with respect to Berlin, certain types of risks requiring the presence of
                            German troops. Secretary said the trip-wire theory would, he feared,
                            perhaps mean that there would be no German troops at all. The idea of a
                            defense build-up is unpopular in Germany as it is in Japan. In addition,
                            from an economic standpoint, the Germans are thriving. This is
                            particularly true because they have no defense budget and are receiving
                            foreign exchange from the presence of foreign forces there. The Germans
                            should consider these factors seriously.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> noted that the US
                            commitment was for a “fair share”. In view of what the Germans are
                            doing, he said he was not at all sure that the large effort that the US
                            is making was justified under that formula. The US is doing more in
                            percentage of gross national production, manpower, length of service,
                            and in many ways are contributing more than the Germans as, he supposed,
                            was the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that in
                            relation to manpower, and assuming a 500,000 man German contribution,
                            the US was contributing almost twice as much as the Germans. In
                            addition, our defense effort was very expensive in light of new
                            developments, <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>, bases and other
                            aspects.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> said that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> was correct: there
                            should be no rigging of the strategic directive to excuse a reduction in
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said we must face
                            up to the British financial problem. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said the US was in the same
                            boat. We had a 1.5 billion dollar balance of payments deficit for the
                            last year and a half. This cannot continue. Our largest single item is
                            troop maintenance abroad.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said that he wondered
                            whether we cannot work out some sensible plan between the trip-wire and
                            the World War II type of organization. After we found that this took a
                            certain number of thousand men, we would then have to figure how long it
                            would take to develop plans on that basis, and see what the Germans
                            could contribute until they could make their proper contribution.
                            Thirdly, we must try to see how to meet the foreign exchange problem to
                            avoid inequality for nations whose troops were stationed abroad.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said the fact
                            seemed to be that the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> and the US
                            provide the only real effective manpower strength on the continent, and
                            asked <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> if that
                            was not right. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>
                            said that that was substantially right. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> noted <pb n="127"
                                xml:id="pg_127" facs="0155"/>that the French forces were in North
                            Africa and there was little contributed by the others. The largest
                            strength was contributed by the two non-continental countries.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> added that the
                            Germans have a manpower shortage, are in an economic boom, do not like
                            the draft, and are looking toward the election. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said the defense effort is about
                            the right to have elections. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> said that the problem was that electioneering for
                            the Germans starts a year ahead of the election. We must consider the
                            possible consequences of this election; it would not be good if the
                            Socialists came into power.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that we
                            think the German build-up plans are sensible. They are taking in
                            careerists and technicians first and will have a good force. Mr.
                                <persName>Head</persName> remarked that their term of service was
                            for only one year. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> said it was graduated, with eighteen month terms
                            for technicians. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                            said our experience was that one needed two year service for technicians
                            and that careerists were required for that work.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> asked what the
                            Germans were paying for British troops. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> remarked that it was politically
                            difficult for them to admit supporting <gloss target="#t_UKG1"
                                >UK</gloss> troops and that the payments must be concealed somehow.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> agreed that
                            payments could not be called “support”. But unless some fund of some
                            kind was established, the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> could not
                            leave its people in Germany.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> asked if the
                            Germans could buy equipment from the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss>.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said the Germans
                            were in a strong economic position that was growing stronger. He said
                            the <gloss target="#t_EPU1">EPU</gloss> might come to an end as the
                            Germans grew still stronger. He felt that <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                                >Adenauer</persName> was fully honorable in his statements, but he
                            feared the German army would not exceed 150,000 men. The Germans will
                            not halt their economic boom and favorable financial position. The
                            British people, who after all won the war, cannot accept that the
                            Germans are treating the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> like dirt
                            while they have things their own way. They will not agree to keeping
                            British soldiers in Germany if the Germans do not play the game. It may
                            take a little longer for the US, but ultimately the US may feel that
                            way, too. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said he
                            had felt that way for a long time, but that some of his colleagues did
                            not agree with him.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that we all
                            recognized the problem that faced the <gloss target="#t_UKG1"
                            >UK</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that
                            because the <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss> had been too long
                            delayed, we had had to step into the breach for five years or so, we
                            thought, but now it seems we cannot take a single man out without
                            creating a large problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> said the
                            answer, from his point of view, might lie in four divisions of about
                            10,000 men each together with the flotation of some sort of fund to help
                            the financial situation. <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0156"/>These
                            divisions should also be supported by atomic weapons or have US atomic
                            forces brigaded in their support.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he thought
                            that the latter was already being done. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Admiral Radford</persName> said it was not being done yet but he
                            has been considering this. He referred to the example of <gloss
                                target="#t_SETAF1">SETAF</gloss> which backs up the Italian forces
                            with atomic power. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                            said we might need other light units which would be similiar to corps
                            artillery. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said
                            that it might be a 5–6,000 man unit or perhaps it could be a little
                            smaller. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said he
                            liked the idea of “atomic corps artillery.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> said that the
                            atomic support might be supplied in that way or by some system that
                            would supply atomic warheads in case of a crisis. Mr.
                                <persName>Head</persName> said that the British were already trained
                            with regard to Corporal, and the Foreign Minister’s idea would fit in in
                            that respect.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he thought that
                            smaller divisions backed up by special corps would be the military
                            answer. We should get away from talking about numbers of divisions just
                            as we had to get away from talking about numbers of wings.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> asked if the
                                <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> and the US were in agreement on
                            the political directive. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn
                                Lloyd</persName> turned to <persName corresp="#p_SSC1">Sir
                                Christopher Steel</persName> who said yes, we were very close. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> had a comment, and the
                            Admiral remarked that he felt the political directive went a little too
                            far in stating that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> force must
                            have an atomic capability. He agreed fully that it was desirable that
                            they have this capability and assured all that he was suggesting no
                            qualification or shift in present policy. After much discussion by all
                            the principals, it appeared to be the consensus that the idea might be
                            expressed that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> force “should
                            have” or “would have” or “might have” an atomic corps and that this
                            would be better.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said suppose we have
                            the directive, then what? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn
                                Lloyd</persName> said that we might then ask the Standing Group what
                            the procedure would be and what forces would be required. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> asked Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_PGW1">Perkins</persName> to comment. He said
                            that there was no decision on what the steps would be after the
                            directive was accepted. The US thinks the process should be undertaken
                            by the Military Authorities. This might take considerable time under
                            normal procedures. <gloss target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss> 14<note n="5"

                            after that would Commanders’ plans be turned to. He suggested that

                            that perhaps the procedure could be shortcut in light thereof.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said, and Air
                            Marshal <persName>Dickson</persName> agreed, that we must recognize in
                            all frankness that the political directive will not reduce
                            requirements.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SSC1">Sir Christopher Steel</persName> said that
                            the Standing Group might ask governments to suggest what forces they
                            would be able to provide over a long period of time. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> responded that this would mean
                            that the answer would be zero. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn
                                Lloyd</persName> appreciated the Secretary’s fear that there might
                            be a general exodus.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> remarked that <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was based on the principle of an
                            internationally balanced force. Some nations could better provide
                            certain things than others. He noted that the French forces were all in
                            North Africa and none were in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He
                            asked what the Germans were going to do if, between the US and <gloss
                                target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss>, we were to make a move. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> asked if the Germans
                            were not the key. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn
                                Lloyd</persName> said they probably were and that we should face
                            them on a common basis.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said we might start
                            from a budgetary point of view. Suppose there were 250,000 men and no
                            foreign exchange problem. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1"
                                >Humphrey</persName> asked if the Germans should pay for all forces
                            in Germany. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said he
                            thought so as far as local expenses were concerned.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> said that the
                            British now have a cost of 70 million pounds a year for local expenses
                            in Germany. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said
                            that if they cut their strength in half, they would not reduce their
                            local cost by 50%, but rather would cut to something in the nature of 40
                            million pounds a year. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn
                                Lloyd</persName> said that counting carry-over the Germans were
                            supplying between 35 and 40 million pounds for support costs this
                            year.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> said that a
                            large force would cost the Germans a lot and they might have to buy some
                            equipment overseas. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>
                            said he was not anxious for the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> to be
                            the source of military production for Germany while Germany got all the
                            commercial contracts. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                            remarked that the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> has full
                            employment, so military production would affect commercial
                            production.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> raised the
                            question of research and development. The <gloss target="#t_UKG1"
                                >UK</gloss> is now budgeting 210 million pounds a year in this area;
                            the Germans are budgeting nothing. A possibility would be to bring the
                            Germans in on the British research and development program as some sort
                            of shareholders. But, he understood, this raised questions with respect
                            to US security regulations. Some Germans, he said, particularly
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH1">Brentano</persName>, are anxious to find some way
                            to come up with the money the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> needs.
                            This idea might be appealing in view thereof. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that if the Germans were
                            dealt in on <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> research and development
                            and not on US research and development, we would have no problem. But,
                            said Mr. <persName>Head</persName>, it <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130"
                                facs="0158"/>is very important that the US and the <gloss
                                target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> should get much closer in this
                            field.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> asked what
                            defense people Germany had with them here in Paris. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said that they had
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> and General
                                <persName>Speidel</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1"
                                >Selwyn Lloyd</persName> said that the British were having a working
                            lunch with the Germans tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said suppose the US,
                            the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> and Canada sat down and worked
                            out the proper forces that they should contribute to <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. This could be followed by talks with
                            the French and maybe others and then with the Germans.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> said that the

                            cash situation, it might come to that. He referred to two escape clauses
                            in the British assurances, the one having to do with “equivalent
                            fighting capacity” and the other with the financial ability of the

                            respect to the former, he said four reduced divisions might be
                            equivalent fighting capacity if they had an atomic fighting capacity
                            behind them. He then read the pertinent part of the text of the British
                            assurances. He said that if <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>
                            would certify equivalent fighting capacity after a cut in British
                            strength, he thought that in all probability <gloss target="#t_WEU1"
                                >WEU</gloss> approval could be obtained.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> noted that even with
                            the full German contribution and an atomic capacity for <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces, we would merely meet the
                            present <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military requirement, and
                            it would be very hard to get the Military Authorities to say they could
                            do with less. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said
                            they need not say that. They should merely adopt the “equivalent” line.
                            Then we should make the Germans contribute for the cost of forces in
                            Germany.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> said that the

                            Atlantic Council to review the financial aspect. However, it was
                            probably better not to start that off before all fifteen nations.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> asked if he
                            were not afraid it might start off a pattern of action. Mr. <persName

                            rather to the overseas nations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> said that expenses overseas were not popular with
                            us either. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said that
                            he sought a balance and a compromise rather than any extreme
                            position.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> agreed but asked
                            how this could be obtained. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn
                                Lloyd</persName> said that atomic deployment was the key. Secretary

                                >Dulles</persName> said he understood the <gloss target="#t_UKG1"
                                >UK</gloss> believed they needed some atomic capacity from the US in
                            order to make their reduced forces the equivalent of their present
                            force. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> said
                            they needed some arrangement for atomic capability, either by way of
                            corps support or, as Mr. <persName>Head</persName> interjected, some
                            arrangement to provide atomics in case of emergency.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he thought some
                            exploratory review with the Germans would be helpful, and maybe with the
                            French as well. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>
                            thought it might be done between the US, <gloss target="#t_UKG1"
                                >UK</gloss> and Canada.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> said that if
                            you were to suppose a figure of X hundred thousand men between us, the
                            question would be how to make it an atomic force.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that the US
                            is committed by the fact that we have told the Germans on pretty high
                            authority that we have no intention of withdrawing forces. The President
                            is impressed by the fact that the political presence of troops in Europe
                            is very important. So he has given, indirectly, if not directly,
                            assurances against any present program for withdrawal.<note n="8"
                                xml:id="d44fn8">See <ref target="#d37">Document 37</ref>.</note>
                            This assurance, however, does not apply to streamlining. He asked
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> how rapid
                            the process of streamlining would be. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Admiral Radford</persName> said it could be speeded up. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he thought it
                            might take about two years and <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> agreed. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> said that we are committed against any abrupt
                            alteration. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said
                            that we do intend over a period of time to reduce in strength.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said that these
                            matters presented both advantages and disadvantages. He asked if there
                            could not be some sort of phased plan for both of us and the Canadians.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> pointed out the danger
                            of public speculation based on staff studies, as had happened last
                            July.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> remarked that the
                            army believed the streamlining would not result in total savings in
                            manpower, as corps units might be heavily increased. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that [the] Admiral and he
                            knew better, and Air Marshal <persName>Dickson</persName> said that this
                            had a familiar ring.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> said that if
                            there was no understanding with the Germans, the <gloss target="#t_UKG1"
                                >UK</gloss> might have to raise this matter in <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. This would not be good as a shot in
                            the arm for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> at a time when we are
                            all trying to strengthen <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that it
                            appeared that the next move lies with the Germans. The question is how
                            much of a political shock would the idea of reduction be to them and how
                            much would they be willing to pay to avoid it. He said the US is willing
                            to use its political <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0160"/>influence
                            to support the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> position, and to take
                            the same position, although over a longer period of time. He said he was
                            not complacent with the present arrangement. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that he hoped the US
                            action would not be too much later.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he thought
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> had some
                            comments on the German build-up. The Admiral said he believed the
                            Germans would have a very efficient small army. They would have five
                            divisions at 80% strength by June, and two more by the end of the year.
                            They have many problems but are overcoming them. On the other hand, it
                            is true that they are getting a free ride for the period while they have
                            no forces. Air Marshal <persName>Dickson</persName> said that
                                <persName>Speidel</persName> put emphasis on the effectiveness of
                            their build-up, and <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> said that his conversation with <persName
                                corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> yesterday had provided further
                            details on the seven divisions. Then <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Admiral Radford</persName> drew attention to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s point that the German build-up
                            would, however, merely meet present <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> requirements. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> remarked that the requirement was based on
                            planning of five years ago. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> said that the planning had resulted in cuts from
                            the Lisbon force goals.<note n="9" xml:id="d44fn9">For documentation on

                                >Admiral Radford</persName> agreed that the German plans for the
                            draft were sensible and clever, considering the position in which the
                            Germans found themselves. The Germans would have a pretty good army by
                            the end of next year and the question is what can be done in the
                            meantime.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> asked whether, if
                            the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> divisions were cut from 18,000 to
                            10,000, this would meet the problem from the military side. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said it would meet
                            the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> budget and manpower problems, but
                            not the foreign exchange problem. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> said that we could probably work out some scheme
                            to do that. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>
                            laughingly suggested that we have German forces stationed in Scotland in
                            order to put the shoe on the other foot.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that we were
                            planning to reduce the number of men in our divisions for our own
                            purposes and saw no reason why the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss>
                            should not do the same, and perhaps do it faster. The <gloss
                                target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> should work with <gloss
                                target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>, perhaps with US help, to get him
                            to accept that reduced <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> forces would
                            provide equivalent fighting ability. Perhaps some pressure on <gloss
                                target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> might have to be exerted. <gloss
                                target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> must of course be alive to the
                            realistic facts involved. <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133" facs="0161"/>And,
                            in so far as the cut in forces would reduce the foreign exchange
                            problems, this should help.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> said the <gloss
                                target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> would try the Germans out at lunch
                            tomorrow. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> cautioned
                            that things should not be left to drift into February or the <gloss
                                target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> would have to do something about the
                            situation. Mr. <persName>Head</persName> said that a preliminary talk
                            with <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> might be very desirable.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> suggested
                            that the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> consider giving full
                            publicity to the increased capacity of their streamlined units.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            said that the US would give very full consideration to the thoughts
                            expressed.</p>

                        <p>I think my remarks covering nearly an hour went over quite well. I tried
                            to pass over lightly specific reference to the British and French
                            adventure and praised them for accepting the <gloss target="#t_UNO1"
                                >UN</gloss> recommendations as to withdrawal. Both <persName
                                corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Lloyd</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PCP1"
                                >Pineau</persName> made what I thought were rather feeble defenses
                            of their action, which <persName corresp="#p_LHM1">Lange</persName> had
                            rather openly attacked. Also he raised the issue of colonialism.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> came to the defense of
                            the British, French and colonial powers. However, so far there are no
                            serious fireworks and there is every evidence ranks will be closed.
                            However, one general sentiment which I gained from practically all of
                            the delegations was the feeling that the United Nations was failing and
                            that it had gotten into the hand of new countries without the sense of
                            political responsibility. I sensed a tendency to want to try to build up
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> as a rival to the United
                            Nations. My own statement included quite a strong defense of the United

                            fair solution within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and otherwise
                            had failed. Greece felt that it had been very restrained on its handling
                            of matter and had taken all efforts for conciliation with <gloss
                                target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> and Turkey. Only response had been
                            criticism in Commons and threats in Cyprus. Greece still desires just
                            and peaceful solution. (2) In regard Cyprus Greek Govt was only
                            fulfilling its moral obligation to Greek Cypriots so as to avoid other
                            countries such as Syria exploiting situation. Strong measures in Cyprus
                            have inflamed situation. Cypriots cannot understand why their fight for
                            freedom should be considered as banditry and treated with brutality.
                            Greek Govt will continue support Cypriot people but will take full
                            account interests of others. It is not asking for any right of veto on
                            decision of Cypriots. If Greeks insist on veto Arabs, seeking intervene,
                            will assert same right and will seek neutralize Cyprus with support of
                            Soviet and Afro-Asian Bloc.</p>

                                >Lloyd</persName>’s expression of satisfaction over careful,
                            scholarly and wise job, adding we can profit much by adoption of report
                            which he hopes will occur, but also by continuing keeping before us
                            wisdom contained therein.</p>
                        <pb n="141" xml:id="pg_141" facs="0169"/>
                        <p>Secretary noted there were a few phrases with which U.S. not wholly in
                            agreement and said he would clarify these points. As example cited
                            paragraph 47 noting that statement that there “cannot be unity in
                            defense and disunity in foreign policy” goes too far if taken literally.
                            Foreign policies all over world need not be in harmony as prerequisite
                            for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense but he deduces that
                            this was not in fact intent of authors. He acknowledged, of course, that
                            some degree disunity would jeopardize defense and noted that report will
                            help us avoid this difficulty.</p>
                        <p>Referring paragraphs 51 and 52,<note n="13" xml:id="d47fn13">Paragraph 51
                                listed the Committee’s recommendations in the field of political
                                consultation. Paragraph 52 recommended that the Foreign Ministers,
                                at each spring meeting, appraise the political progress of the
                                Alliance.</note> Secretary noted this might seem to call for
                            consultation in Council before adoption any foreign policy or any
                            pronouncement affecting others. This is principle we would strive apply
                            within reason and limits our constitutional processes although literal
                            application not possible. Referred to procedures in U.S. Government for
                            policy formulation including <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> and
                            consultation by executive with Congress and congressional committees.
                            Secretary also noted institution of press conferences, corresponding
                            roughly to question period in Parliament, where pronouncements rarely
                            are of new policy but often so represented. Each member has some
                            problems of this sort and U.S. would presume that adoption of report not
                            intended cut across these established procedures.</p>
                        <p>Like some other members, Secretary noted, U.S. also has worldwide
                            responsibilities and is member collective security associations, each
                            association calling for consultation. Such arrangements exist with 44
                            countries, 30 of which not represented on Council. Matters of more
                            direct concern to others cannot be put up for prior consultation in
                                <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>. U.S. cannot have hierarchy of
                            relationships among allies around world. Nevertheless, Secretary
                            believed this involves no practical conflict with recommendations of
                            report.</p>
                        <p>Secretary added consultation must not prevent timely and effective action
                            by governments. Within U.S. Government consultation already required
                            with so many departments and agencies that effectiveness of action
                            already often interfered with and therefore we have added difficulties
                            in way of consulting. Mean [<hi rend="italic">Must</hi>?], nevertheless,
                            take into account views friends and allies as far as we are aware of
                            them. Important, therefore, that Council look into problems in advance
                            and viewpoints members be made known to all in case quick action later
                            required. U.S. ready discuss and explain policy on any foreseeable
                            problem in world in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> as, in fact, it
                            has already done with regard situations Korea, Formosa, Japan and
                            others. Under such an arrangement, if China should attack Taiwan,
                            Council would know <pb n="142" xml:id="pg_142" facs="0170"/>in advance
                            our likely reaction if we did not consult before reacting to attack.
                            Secretary General perhaps should have responsibility calling attention
                            of members to troublesome matters before necessary take action on them,
                            as we do in U.S. in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>. Would welcome
                            adoption this procedure in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and
                            believe might avoid member seeming act without approval of allies in
                            emergency.</p>
                        <p>Secretary recalled saying last April it would not be good drift into
                            ill-defined relationship which could create more ill will than solve
                            problems. If adopting report means U.S. will do nothing in world without
                            consulting <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>, this will lead to
                            confusion, misunderstanding and descrimination.</p>
                        <p>However, in context given by comments of three authors, believe it clear
                            this not intended.</p>
                        <p>Secretary expressed strong hope U.S. Government that recommendations of
                            Wise Men will not be taken as substituted for closer military,
                            political, economic relationships European members of Atlantic
                            community. Referring to Coal and Steel Community and possibility Common
                            Market and others, Secretary noted greater unity in Council is no
                            substitute for even more far reaching unity between certain members
                            where circumstances and geography make this appropriate.</p>
                        <p>As matter personal privilege, Secretary referred paragraph 96<note n="14"
                                xml:id="d47fn14">Paragraph 96 stated that the Council’s Committees

                            reports and questionnaires and assistance from delegations. Proposals in

                            Secretary General’s position as mediator were reinforced. <persName

                            both parties not fully agreeable and cooperative. Finally, he agreed
                            with U.S. that nature development of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                            not intended as criticism. He separated action of approving report from
                            agreement to publish, noting that if publication decided on French would
                            require certain amendment in addition to those required to permit their

                            mentioned Far East, Middle East and North Africa. Felt this point should

                            Then raised question of whether resolution approving report could be
                            adopted. Not decided at this point and it was ultimately agreed to put

                            considered in other forums. <persName corresp="#p_CPAV1"

                        <p>Secretary again spoke for approval of report. Would not commit us all to

                            resolution might be changed to obviate difficulty which was apparently

                            disturbances in satellites, said Soviet capability to mount attack not

                            appears unchanged. While satellite situation has not improved Soviet
                            posture, it has lead to actions and threats whereby risk of general war
                            increased. Soviet has flexibility to quickly reverse its intentions.
                            Danger lies in Soviet miscalculations combined with its enormous
                            military capability.</p>

                        <p>Head spokesman for <gloss target="#t_UKG1">U.K.</gloss> said <gloss
                                target="#t_UKG1">U.K.</gloss> played part in initiating Directive

                            thinks Directive should now go to standing group who should consult
                            governments and Supreme Allied Commanders as to how to give effect to

                            considerations. Had two specific comments: (1) <gloss target="#t_UKG1"

                            new weapons. No one can afford to maintain both current numbers of
                            personnel and new arms, nor afford to have old arms vis-à-vis Soviet
                            capabilities. This means must have less men and better equipment
                            including tactical atomic weapons. But must not rely on machinery alone.
                            Considerable manpower in shield is needed for foreseeable future. <gloss
                                target="#t_UKG1">U.K.</gloss> will supply substantial proportion
                            thereof. Chancellor of Exchequer will wish to speak later on

                            these questions which adds to importance of Directive. Statement on
                            assumption of stationing of forces of U.S., <gloss target="#t_UKG1"
                                >U.K.</gloss> and Canada in Europe of greatest importance.</p>
                        <p>However, shield forces are too weak and only way to strengthen them is
                            with atomic weapons. Public opinion recognized this, and availability of
                            tactical atomic weapons necessary to give public confidence. … They
                            should be integrated at corps or army level, and warheads could remain
                            in hands of nations now possessing them.</p>

                            tactical atomic weapons should be available down to divisional

                            confirmed by recent events. Shield forces must have high efficiency.
                            This requires constant modernization for both conventional and new
                            weapons. Only common effort can accomplish this, and it should include

                            Said everyone aware that nuclear weapons are required to implement
                            forward strategy which is necessary if Europe not to be overrun. A
                            strong and solid shield of forces of all Allied nations is required.
                            Only thus can surprise attack with conventional weapons, accepted as
                            possibility in Part 1 of paper, be deterred. We must realize that a
                            swift occupancy of Western Europe might lead to hesitancy to use atomic
                            weapons.</p>

                            limited to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area, authorities
                            should know magnitude of Soviet threat to <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> area and deal with it perhaps in framework Baghdad
                            Pact. Turkish Prime Minister has said we must have contact between

                            created in 1948 to meet pressing and immediate danger and has so far
                            been successful as Russian advances in Europe have been halted although
                            not reversed. Last forward move was in Czechoslovakia. Intervening years
                            have brought immense change in character of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. Instead of occupying armies now have permanent
                            alliance based on equality mainly for defense but also for other
                            purposes joining nations of Europe with two great nations of North
                            America.</p>

                        <p>But founders of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> could not have
                            realized full financial and economic implications. There are different
                            effects on different members. These depend not on forces which are made
                            available, but on chance of location of where these forces are to be
                            stationed. This is based on military considerations. Financial and
                            economic consequences thereof are very important.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_UKG1">U.K.</gloss> forces are stationed overseas in
                            Germany. This requires local costs of 60–70 million pounds a year.
                            Arrangements for support costs expire soon, and unless some fresh
                            arrangements are made soon, foreign exchange burdens will fall solely on
                                <gloss target="#t_UKG1">U.K.</gloss> This poses very serious problem
                            for <gloss target="#t_UKG1">U.K.</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_UKG1">U.K.</gloss> has had some preliminary discussions

                            problem will be reached through negotiation as it cannot accept

                            particularly fitting as <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> forces

                            problem will exist re troops stationed abroad. This problem should be
                            studied in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and some equalizing
                            fund or other multilateral solution found to long term problem. Should

                                <gloss target="#t_UKG1">U.K.</gloss> spending 1.5–1.6 billion pounds
                            a year. This highest proportion of money for any European member.</p>

                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area are 160 million pounds a year.
                            Two-thirds of <gloss target="#t_UKG1">U.K.</gloss> research and
                            development element is for defense. Fifteen percent of metal goods
                            production is for defense and this affects industry and export. For last
                            four years <gloss target="#t_UKG1">U.K.</gloss> has spent 400 million

                            effort has two dangers. By reason large contribution to defense, <gloss

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> concluded, saying he had
                            spoken long and frankly at turning point of Western Alliance. While he
                            had listed difficulties to be faced, he could give assurance <gloss

                        <p>Secretary spoke next. Said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> will talk later on annual review and give details
                            current U.S. approach.<note n="6" xml:id="d49fn6">See <ref target="#d51"

                        <p>On Directive, Secretary said he shared view of <persName corresp="#p_MH1"
                                >Macmillan</persName> that thorough review <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> defense planning needed to determine how within
                            resources likely to be available defense effort of Alliance and each
                            individual member can best achieve most effective pattern of forces.
                            Problem of resources likely to be available is difficult one.
                            Considerations <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> had
                            referred to must realistically be taken into account.</p>
                        <p>U.S. plans continue very large effort, and perhaps overall effort
                            appreciably greater than last year in terms of dollars. How to do this
                            to best advantage particularly re <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            is difficult problem.</p>
                        <p>Secretary referred to paragraph 3 of Directive,<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d49fn7">Paragraph 3 stated that for <gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                            protected. Said he fully agreed. This is area where primary
                            responsibility rests on U.S. maintenance and also protection of this
                            force is very heavy burden and part of contribution U.S. can
                            appropriately make. Recognized U.S. has facilities in other countries
                            where we rely on assistance and good will of allies as contribution to
                            this part of defense effort.</p>
                        <p>Secretary referred to last sentence of paragraph 4 reassumption U.S.,
                                <gloss target="#t_UKG1">U.K.</gloss>, Canadian forces will continue
                            be stationed in Europe. Said it is intent of U.S. to continue station
                            troops in Europe and fully comply with spirit and understanding of
                            statement under which they are here. In this respect he referred to
                            President’s assurances of March 10, 1955 and read paragraph 3
                                thereof.<note n="8" xml:id="d49fn8">For text of <persName

                        <p>Re reference to “fair share” in President’s assurances, Secretary stated
                            following figures (1955 calendar year statistics):</p>
                        <p>Total U.S. defense expenditures were $40.5 billion or 11.2 percent <gloss
                                target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>. Of 13,700,000 male population 18–30
                            years old, three million or 21 percent under arms. U.S. has 24 months
                            period of service. U.S. ground forces in Europe constitute one-third of
                            M-day ground forces in Central European area. U.S. supplies 75 squadrons
                            or 1,605 aircraft which is 25 percent of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> aircraft in all Europe.</p>
                        <p>We now have task to adapt <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense
                            to needs of modern warfare. Must have atomic weapons for not only
                            strategic but also <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0182"/>tactical
                            purposes. But this burden cannot be added to burden already assumed.</p>
                        <p>U.S. proceeding to streamline its divisions to make them fit effectively
                            into pattern of modern warfare, a practice being generally adopted.
                            Maybe presence of atomic weapons and units may permit reduction in
                            manpower without loss of effectiveness. That is for military authorities
                            to consider. But this cannot add additional defense burden to one that
                            already exists.</p>
                        <p>Given conditions that may arise in Europe, <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> should not rely wholly on atomic weapons, although
                            proper to say we have primary reliance on them. Conventional forces are
                            necessary, and burden of supplying conventional forces should
                            increasingly be assumed by Europeans. This will, of course, be
                            consequence of German build up.</p>
                        <p>U.S. has no present intention or plans cutting across Political
                            Directive, which we support. U.S. believes it should be acted on with
                            all speed.</p>
                        <p>There remain problems that can only be resolved as we get responses to
                            Directive. Given unity of spirit, determination and resolution by all
                            members to build common defense to deter war and if need be to repel
                            attack, treaty programs can be accomplished without impairment of
                            economy of any member. Impairment of economy could have as serious
                            consequences as lack of military preparation.</p>
                        <p>New weapons, costs and concept all require review. If adequately followed
                            up, U.S. will do what is necessary to enable us to maintain an equal and
                            fair participation in this essential task.</p>
                        <p>Greece spoke next. Said forward strategy should be used in south,
                            including Greece, and expressed hope this could be studied.</p>
                        <p>Staf spoke for Netherlands. Was concerned at problem of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> intelligence which was insufficient
                            in recent crisis. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> commanders
                            lacked necessary intelligence because they were dependent on national
                            intelligence. Understood commanders were making proposals on this
                            subject and urged all to meet <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            needs to greatest extent possible.</p>
                        <p>Further, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> governments did not get
                            sufficient information from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> on
                            which to base national action. Netherlands had to take decisions by
                            itself while had expected guidance from <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. Also, on increase of forces issue, had received
                            advice from commanders after specifically requesting, but specific
                            request had been necessary. New procedure is required to give guidance
                            to subordinate commanders and Defense Ministers after consultation in
                            Council.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> is physically available for

                            did not lie with <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss>. <gloss

                                >NATO</gloss> should have it, as would be beyond our capacity.
                            Military authorities depend on intelligence provided by members. In
                            normal times this is sufficient. But in critical times, countries,
                            particularly large ones who are principal sources of intelligence,
                            become preoccupied with own requirements. During recent sensitive and
                            critical period there had been complete breakdown on receipt useful
                            intelligence at <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss>. He has raised
                            this directly with <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss>’s and has had
                            immediate responses which he believes will bear fruit. Is taking action
                            to provide positive link so flow will be prompt and adequate providing
                            all support. Strongly prefers and urges nations to make intelligence
                            available on cosmic basis so it can be distributed to all. However,
                            understandable some may wish to protect certain data and expressed his
                            anxiety to receive such data on private or restricted basis if this
                            necessary, which limitations he would observe. On Staf’s comment on lack
                            of guidance from <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss>, said it true
                            that for first few days did not supply guidance that should have been
                            given. Major reason was lack of intelligence and in addition had not
                            recognized need for advice early enough. Had given advice on third day
                            even though only on basis limited intelligence and continued give
                            guidance considered necessary.</p>
                        <p>Made strong plea to Council to get behind providing intelligence that was
                            required. Emphasized that all <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            expenditures on men, material, and infrastructure was useless unless he
                            had intelligence on how to employ it.</p>
                        <p>Chairman, on behalf Council, thanked <persName corresp="#p_NGL1"

                            Need for forces still apparent and in this spirit Dutch had decided
                            create second active infantry division. More shield forces still needed.
                            Problem of annual recurring costs urgently needs solution. Dutch believe
                            solution possible only on multilateral basis.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> spoke for Germans. Recent
                            events showed need for greater political unity and political strength of
                            West than ever. Germany cannot ignore anxiety of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> at small German contribution for
                            common defense which supplies defense of Germany. Reaffirmed that
                            changes in German plans do not change determination of German Government
                            to accomplish build-up in accordance with recommendations made. Will
                            continue to discuss and plan with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            authorities. Will proceed on assumption that technical as well as
                            political reappraisal will be taken into account. Despite action of
                            Parliament on 12-month term of service, government now sponsoring
                            legislation that would allow 12 to 18 month term depending on category
                            with 50 percent increased reserve service as well as providing for
                            standby forces. These measures are taken for the shield in Central
                            Europe to which 12 German divisions will contribute. They will have most
                            modern equipment and great flexibility. Will be largely motorized, and
                            suited to all kinds operations. Must be equipped with most modern
                            weapons available.</p>
                        <p>Germany believes Soviet long-term aims are against Central Europe. Action
                            in Middle East is merely step on way to Berlin and Paris. German forces
                            alone cannot deal with threat. Therefore Germany welcomes reference to
                            shield forces in Political Directive. Statement therein about US, <gloss

                            so any aggression can be met if need be with atomic weapons. Gratified
                            French statement intention return divisions from North Africa in 1957.
                            Recent lesson Hungary has increased willingness German people to
                            contribute fair share. Agrees to resolution on annual review.<note n="6"

                        <p>Canada has given $1.4 billion in mutual aid, of which approximately $1
                            billion in equipment and not in training. Training will decrease for

                            Atlantic Council meeting December 14 on item V of agenda.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Verbatim text:</hi></p>
                        <p>The United States believes without reservation that the solidarity of
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and its combined military
                            strength are essential to the defense of the individual <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nations and as a necessary bulwark to
                            preserve freedom in the world. Unfortunately, as recent events have
                            indicated too clearly, the objectives of the Soviets have not as yet
                            changed and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> continues to be a
                            necessary deterrent to their aggressive intentions.</p>
                        <p>Soviet military capabilities for land, sea, and air warfare have
                            increased as the industrial development of Russia and the satellite
                            nations has progressed. The Soviets are known to have atomic weapons and
                            increasing capabilities to deliver them. They are also devoting a
                            disproportionately large part of their economic effort to capital goods
                            expansion which is largely for military purposes rather than for raising
                            the standard of living of their people. This growing military capability
                                <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0187"/>of the USSR accentuates the
                            need for a continuing effort on the part of each of us to make certain
                            that this increasing threat is being properly countered.</p>
                        <p>Many, with reason, are coming to believe that the rise of Communism has
                            reached and passed its peak and millions of people throughout the world
                            are coming to realize that international Communism is not the path to
                            security, social justice or happiness for individuals, nor the road to
                            independence, prosperity and peace for any nation. Granted that these
                            beliefs are justified by a careful analysis of current events, this in
                            itself does not mean that the danger of military action has lessened. In
                            fact, it may well mean that over the next several years the danger may
                            even be increased.</p>
                        <p>Effective internationally balanced forces must remain a prime objective
                            of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. It should not be our aim to
                            seek to achieve completely balanced and self-sufficient forces within
                            each <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> country’s military
                            establishment. The total of national military efforts should
                            increasingly reflect the approved <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            military concepts that land, sea, and air forces must be provided in
                            such strength and be so deployed that an aggressor will be discouraged
                            from undertaking any type of aggression. Any changes in <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> force structure should, of course, be
                            made under approved <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            procedures.</p>
                        <p>The United States Army is beginning to reorganize its divisions, using
                            improved and more powerful weapons. The Chief of Staff of the United
                            States Army has discussed the implications of the new United States Army
                            divisional organization with the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            Military Committee.</p>
                        <p>Atomic fire support for ground combat operations has been strengthened in
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> by the addition of the
                            Southern European Task Force which provides the first specialized ground
                            atomic force designed for use in support of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> operations.</p>
                        <p>The modernization of the United States Navy through its shipbuilding and
                            conversion program, is resulting in continuous improvements in its
                            anti-submarine warfare and fleet air defense capabilities. In addition,
                            over the past several years the striking power of the fleet has been
                            increased manyfold. In this regard the Navy’s atomic capability in both
                            offensive and defensive roles has played a major part.</p>
                        <p>All tactical bombers and fighter bombers of the United States Air Force
                            assigned to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> are now trained and
                            equipped to deliver atomic weapons. It is our view that this development
                            has increased many times the deterrent effect of the military forces
                            available to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> commanders. While not
                            specifically assigned to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, the
                            Strategic Air Command, which is being modernized and strengthened, is a
                            vital deterrent force.</p>
                        <p>The continued improvement of the effectiveness of the air defense system
                            for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is a matter of importance. The
                            need exists <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0188"/>for affirmative
                            action by all member countries if we are to achieve the ultimate goal of
                            an effective integrated air defense system. We must insure that required
                            radar stations are placed in continuous operation. The Forward Scatter
                            Communications System should be completed at the earliest feasible date.
                            Requirements for skilled technicians must not be overlooked. Substantial
                            improvement in the combat readiness for air crews is essential.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military structure is built
                            around the individual national capabilities of its members. In
                            developing adequate <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces it must
                            be appreciated that, regardless of the weapons available, there is no
                            magic formula for greatly increasing military strength and at the same
                            time substantially reducing military expenditures. I am personally very
                            conscious of the fact, for as many of you know, we are now in the
                            process in the United States of finalizing our military budget for the
                            coming fiscal year.</p>
                        <p>The United States Government has indicated on many occasions the
                            importance it attaches to having the forces of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> properly equipped. The manner and extent to which
                            modern weapons will be incorporated into <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> forces must, of course, be determined in conjunction
                            with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military authorities and with
                            what the countries themselves can afford in their own overall military
                            programs. The ability of the United States to assist in a modernization
                            program for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is dependent to a
                            considerable degree on the willingness and the increasing capability of
                            the other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries to provide
                            most of the maintenance support for their own forces. In certain
                            individual cases, alternative commitments may be required of countries
                            whose forces are to be modernized.</p>
                        <p>Our belief in the need for continual modernization of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces is reflected in the United
                            States fiscal year 1957 Military Assistance Program. We intend to
                            propose a similar program for fiscal year 1958. The types and amounts of
                            weapons programmed for the current year will be made known to the
                            individual countries after negotiations with appropriate governmental
                            authorities.</p>
                        <p>Previously approved appropriated funds have been made available to
                            provide an initial amount of <gloss target="#t_Nike1">Nike</gloss>
                            ground equipment. Current programs include air-warning equipment, <gloss
                                target="#t_Nike1">Nike</gloss> surface-to-air missiles and control
                            equipment, <persName>Honest John</persName> rockets, Matadors,
                            air-to-air rockets and improved anti-submarine warfare equipment. The
                            United States will, of course, provide technical and training assistance
                            where required to the individual countries receiving these weapons.</p>
                        <p>Our experience with modem weapons generally indicates that technical
                            personnel who are willing to make military service their career will be
                            required to master their complexity. The training of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces, particularly with respect to
                            utilization, maintenance <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0189"/>and
                            logistics problems associated with modern aircraft and modern weapons
                            requires increased emphasis by all of us.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the delivery of new weapons under its Military Assistance
                            Program and to assist those of our allies who are willing and able to
                            develop their own modern weapons system, the United States is prepared
                            to make available promptly certain items of modern weapons and equipment
                            along with appropriate technical data to assist in the development and
                            production of such weapons and equipment. This will further the
                            objectives of equipping <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> with
                            modern weapons and will make better use of the vast pool of scientific
                            and technological skills and resources that already exist in <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries.</p>
                        <p>The initiation of this program will require special arrangements to
                            establish satisfactory provisions for security and for the exchange of
                            information between the United States and the individual countries. The
                            United States will consult as appropriate with the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military authorities and the
                            International Staff in the assessment of national capabilities regarding
                            utilization and production of new weapons.</p>
                        <p>The United States confirms the view expressed during the February 1956
                            military meeting<note n="2" xml:id="d51fn2">No record of this meeting
                                has been found in Department of State files.</note> that expensive,
                            unnecessary duplication and uncoordinated production of weapons in
                            Europe should be avoided. We recognize that practical obstacles have
                            impeded progress in this field in the past. The initiative for the
                            development of appropriate plans for production rests primarily with the
                            countries involved. It is difficult to see any final long-term solution
                            for such military and economic problems except on the basis of
                            coordinated or integrated production in Western Europe.</p>
                        <p>Countries in the best position to proceed should do so, coordinating
                            their production plans and anticipated needs among themselves for
                            maximum efficiency. They should keep <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> informed of their plans, accomplishments and
                            requirements. They should welcome the participation of other nations in
                            their production programs through subcontracting, licensing or other
                            arrangements.</p>
                        <p>Progress has been made during the past year in bringing into focus many
                            vital problems which confront the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            Alliance. Each country must furnish to the common effort whatever it is
                            best able to do within the limits of its national capabilities. All of
                            us must increase our military effectiveness by carefully appraising the
                            relative merits of weapons and equipment to make sure that our forces
                            are equipped with the right ones. We must also practice efficiency and
                            economy so that increased costs of the required new weapons and
                            equipment will not become an intolerable burden. Improved training <pb
                                n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0190"/>and utilization of personnel
                            must be a necessary ingredient of our policies.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> must remain the bulwark of Western
                            defense for the deterrence of military aggression. It must continue to
                            be alert to the fundamental danger to all its members. It must do its
                            full part in the great effort toward maintaining peace in the world.
                            Only by the realization of the continuing nature of the Soviet threat
                            and the magnitude of the task for which <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> was created can we retain our common heritage.</p>

                        <p>At the concluding session of the North Atlantic Council Ministerial
                            meeting on December 14 at 5 p.m., it was decided that the date of the
                            next meeting should be determined by the Permanent Council. The Council
                            then revised and approved the communiqué. In his concluding remarks,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> expressed his
                            great appreciation to Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MG1"
                                >Martino</persName> and the International Staff for the effective
                            way in which the meeting had been conducted. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> stated: “Many people had said that this would be
                            one of most important if not most important Council meeting ever held.
                            Events had proved correctness of this forecast. Perhaps there had been
                            nothing spectacular so far as public concerned. However, Committee of
                            Three Report, if followed up, would be regarded in future as great
                            turning point of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Political
                            Directive also most important and had been most difficult such action
                            Council had taken since Lisbon. Also, as byproduct of meeting, members
                            had been able to bury if not entirely resolve their differences. United
                            States thus regarded achievements of meeting as of great importance.”

                            said that pressure for such a meeting did not develop.<note n="3"

                                November 16. In his December 3 memorandum of his conversation with
                                the President, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> wrote
                                that he felt that the era of tripartite meetings had about drawn to
                                a close and he hoped to avoid any such meeting in Paris. He told the
                                President that it was increasingly difficult to maintain the
                                illusion that France was one of the great world powers, and that
                                this was increasingly an irritant to countries like Germany and

                        <p>He said that the biggest difficulty had been the desire of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries to have U.S. policy made in
                            the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council. He had stressed that
                            we stand ready to discuss policies—and prefer to do so earlier rather
                            than later—but that we could not commit ourselves to anything of this
                            kind. The President interjected that the others obviously could not
                            either, for constitutional reasons.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries had suggested a communiqué
                            implying that all the countries, the U.S. included, had concerted a
                            policy of handling the Middle East situation. When Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out how such a statement
                            would appear to world opinion and asked them to reconsider their
                            proposal, they dropped this provision. The Secretary said it was
                            difficult to find and to follow the narrow path between, on the one
                            side, strengthening <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and, on the
                            other, avoiding the appearance of “teaming up” and taking positions in
                            the <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UN</gloss> as a bloc.</p>
                        <p>He said the Council had adopted the Report of Three,<note n="4"

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that one good
                            feature of the meetings was the evidence of closer German relations with
                            the British and French. The Germans readily accepted the principle of
                            giving another year of financial support to the costs of British forces
                            in Germany. The French and the Germans seemed to be working well on the
                            Saar problem. The British are moving towards support of the common
                            market (although on the basis that the Suez incident has shown that they
                            can no longer act as an independent great power; the President said that
                            no one can).</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> commented on the
                            great change that has occurred regarding the significance of satellite
                            forces. The sixty satellite divisions can no longer be regarded as an
                            addition to Soviet forces—in fact they may immobilize certain Soviet
                            forces.</p>

                                disagreed with the proposals. (Memorandum of conversation by

                            regarding these proposals, particularly with regard to the possibility
                            that they might be followed by actions in other countries. As you <pb
                                n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0194"/>know, I discussed this matter
                            with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName>
                            when he was in Washington two weeks ago.<note n="3" xml:id="d55fn3"

                                Washington, March 3–7, for talks with U.S. officials on topics of
                                mutual concern.</note> I pointed out to him that we must recognize
                            that the British are under a serious economic and financial strain and
                            that we had reluctantly and after much effort come to the conclusion
                            that a reduction in British forces on the continent was unavoidable. It
                            seemed to me that we should try to make the reduction as gradual as
                            possible and as consistent as possible with the military views of <gloss
                                target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>As you know, <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> has made certain
                            recommendations with regard to the British proposals which he considers,
                            if adopted, would go a long way toward mitigating the effects from a
                            military viewpoint, provided that other countries maintain their force
                            goals. I believe that, if it were publicly known that the British had
                            generally met <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>’s views, this
                            would do a great deal to avoid the psychological and political effects
                            of the proposal which have concerned us all.</p>
                        <p>I feel that, after we have done all we can, we must make the utmost
                            effort to avoid an open break over this matter, which I feel would have
                            the most grave effects on the alliance. I doubt very seriously that the
                            British would be able to agree to a postponement by a full year of their
                            plans, as you have proposed. It seems to me that we must also consider
                            what the effect would be of announcing a review of our over-all <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense position in the light of the
                            British proposal. If the public gained the impression that the <gloss
                                target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> proposals raised issues of such
                            seriousness, we might well have set in motion the very forces which we
                            have been anxious in all of our considerations of the British proposals
                            to avoid.</p>
                        <p>My own view is that we should reach an agreement now on the best position
                            which we can get the British to accept. This I think will enable us best
                            to preserve our unity. I hope that you will give these thoughts your
                            most earnest consideration in connection with the instructions given to
                            your representatives in London.<note n="4" xml:id="d55fn4">On March 27,

                        <p>The North Atlantic Council began its meeting with a public session on the
                            morning of May 2 where Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                                >Adenauer</persName> welcomed the Foreign Ministers. Secretary
                            General <persName corresp="#p_IBHL1">Ismay</persName> then reported on
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>’s achievements in the previous
                            5-year period. Following that session, the Council met in four plenary
                            sessions on May 2, 3, and 4. The Foreign Ministers spent the first three
                            sessions discussing the significance for <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> of trends in Soviet policy, developments in Europe,
                            the Middle East, and other areas, and the question of disarmament. The
                            Council noted that since its last meeting, the Soviets had launched a
                            campaign to induce public opinion in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> countries to oppose the modernization of defense
                            forces in the Alliance. The representatives denounced Soviet attempts to
                            intimidate the Alliance, but stated with satisfaction that the Allies
                            had not been deluded and had firmly replied to these Soviet
                            maneuvers.</p>
                        <p>In a lengthy statement on May 3, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> stressed the need to make <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> a durable alliance. He said its
                            members must not only guard against assaults and attacks from without,
                            but also be aware of strains within the Alliance. He spoke of
                            disagreements and differences among the Allies over the Middle East,
                            Cyprus, and the British Government’s plan, announced in the White Paper
                            on defense policy published on April 4, to cut drastically its defense
                            budget, to rely on the nuclear deterrent, and to reduce its forces on
                            the continent. (For text of the White Paper, see the <hi rend="italic"
                                >New York Times</hi>, April 5, 1957.) The Secretary of State argued
                            that they must prevent problems of the moment from disrupting the
                            solidarity of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and reiterated his
                            pleasure that the members had lived through the worst period of
                            strain.</p>

                        <p>The Council discussed the question of balance between conventional and
                            atomic weapons, reiterating the position taken the previous September
                            that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> must be in a position to meet
                            any attack which might be launched against it. To reassure the Allies in
                            light of the British Government’s decision to reduce their forces on the
                            continent, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> stated that the
                            President had no plans to withdraw United States forces from Europe.</p>
                        <p>The Council agreed <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>’s defense policy
                            did not preclude limitation of armaments. But as <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> reported to the President on May
                            3, the continental countries, excluding Germany, were fearful of any
                            nuclear disarmament because it might have left them dominated by Soviet
                            ground forces and dependent upon German ground forces for their
                            security. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> stated that
                            there was much concern that the West would adopt atomic disarmament
                            measures which were not foolproof and which were not equally connected
                            with a dependable limitation of conventional armament. “Indeed” wrote
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, “if the point of view
                            reflected here were to be controlling, there would not be a chance, in
                            my opinion, of any disarmament at all. I argued for controlling what was
                            controllable and not abandoning the task because some elements were
                            perhaps uncontrollable.” (<gloss target="#t_Dulte1">Dulte</gloss> 5 from

                        <p>At the final meeting on May 4, the Council discussed and praised the
                            Secretary General’s report and approved the final communiqué. The
                            Council expressed satisfaction that useful progress and concrete results
                            had been achieved in political consultation under new procedures
                            inaugurated as a result of the recommendations of the Report of the
                            Committee of Three on Non-Military Co-operation in <gloss

                            for his 5 years of service to the Alliance, the Council adjourned.</p>
                        <p>In summing up the meeting for the President, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> wrote that the Council meeting had been a good
                            one, perhaps the best of all he had attended. He said there were points
                            of discord, most notably over the question of British troop withdrawals
                            from Germany and Cyprus. Some of the basic issues which had been avoided
                            before were discussed more openly at the meeting “with a greater degree
                            of frankness and unstudied expression than has been the case
                            heretofore.” (<gloss target="#t_Dulte1">Dulte</gloss> 5 from Bonn, May
                            3; Department of State, Central Files, 320.5774/5–357)</p>
                        <p>Upon his return to Washington on May 7 from the meetings in Bonn and
                            Paris, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> issued a brief
                            statement which expressed his satisfaction with the scope and tone of

                            all seemed to boil down to one, that is, do we need conventional forces
                            in this nuclear age? To this his answer was unequivocally yes. He went
                            on to describe <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>’s mission in
                            terms existing <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> doctrine; then
                            described Soviet threat, indicating main changes were in introduction
                            atomic capability into Soviet forces and increasing strength submarine
                            fleet.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> then bore down on
                            importance of shield forces, stressing relationship between shield and
                            “conventional forces”. He described aspects of shield as (a) consisting
                            of all services; (b) having a dual capability; and (c) being deployed in
                            forward area. Functions of shield he described as (a) to defend peoples
                            and territories; (b) to complete the deterrent; and (c) to provide
                            “essential alternative” to employment of ultimate capability. This last
                            point <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> elaborated at
                            considerable length, stressing that it was up to governments <pb n="171"
                                xml:id="pg_171" facs="0199"/>concerned to decide whether they wished
                            to avoid situation in which, if <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            line were breached without use of force (which might be result of too
                            thin a shield), they would have to make hard decision of being first to
                            use force in order restore position. He stressed point that, if <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> has only token shield forces, <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> invites local action, and further,
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would have to depend
                            principally on massive retaliation. He stated frankly that he dwelt on
                            these political questions because he wished it understood that <gloss
                                target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> military study is based in part
                            on interpretation of Political Directive and it was up to Council to
                            tell him if he was wrong on these fundamental assumptions.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> then spoke of importance
                            of early warning of attack through intelligence sources, which he said
                            had been somewhat improved since last November. Stressed <gloss
                                target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss>’s complete dependence on national

                        <p>Progress of early warning radar and communications system was described
                            as satisfactory, but alert system still has gaps which should be closed.
                            On air defense, <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> said that
                            study reveals air defense system with limited aims, i.e., defense of key
                            points, which is necessitated by staggering cost of blanket air
                            defense.</p>
                        <p>On national service, he said study does not support conclusion reached in
                            1952 on uniform training and length of service, but indicates
                            desirability more flexibility, although generally longer training is
                            indicated because of more complex weapons. Dwelt at some length on
                            concept of collective balance of forces, stating that very little
                            progress had been made on this concept to date, but that now with new
                            weapons <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> can make progress in this
                            direction and thereby greatly conserve its resources.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> then turned briefing over to
                            other <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss> officers who, working from
                            charts, described conclusions of study by services. Also gave
                            interesting picture new logistic requirements developed on concepts
                            nuclear war.</p>
                        <p>Air Marshal Constantine (United Kingdom) summarized, stating aim of study
                            was to find minimum force requirements to carry out <gloss
                                target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> mission through 1963 and to plan
                            that this study represented his best military judgment of what the
                            Alliance should have, tempered by acute awareness of limits on
                            resources. It was up to governments, of course, to make the decisions
                            implied by the study.</p>

                            would like to begin with summary of some of the major political
                            consultations undertaken in the Council. He referred to the change in
                            the length of Belgian military service, disarmament, and the Middle
                            East.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the Belgian decision to reduce the term of its
                            military service, he commented this was, in fact, a unilateral decision,
                            worked out by the Belgian government before informing <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He said this was a bad procedure and
                            that decisions should not be taken and <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> informed afterwards.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the disarmament talks, he said the <gloss
                                target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> consultations had not delayed
                            operations in London. He said the August 29 proposal, in fact, was a
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-approved one.<note n="3"

                                August 1957. This resulted in the full endorsement by the other

                                (Washington, 1960), pp. 868–874.</note> He said the success of the
                            operation should not be exaggerated since, in the case of disarmament,
                            divergencies were ironed out, but there had been no real differences in
                            view.</p>

                                >Spaak</persName> said that all of the delegations had contributed
                            to the discussion and had indicated some ideas on how to counteract
                            Soviet efforts in this area. He said while some of the ideas have been
                            good ones, the discussion had not yet gone very far. … <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> said that, in general, he had
                            found good will existed and the desire for meaningful consultation. He
                            noted that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> machinery was
                            somewhat heavy, as the Ambassadors, of course, had to get instructions
                            from their governments; while some operated quickly, others were very
                            slow, and this created a gap in the timing of instructions.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> added another feature of
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> political consultation was
                            that it involved a number of the smaller countries on matters on which
                            they had no policy, not previously having been concerned therewith. In
                            this connection, he noted that all of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> countries had been willing to declare their solidarity
                            with Turkey, had not the Turkish case been transferred to the <gloss

                        <p>Passing to economic problems, <persName corresp="#p_SPH1"
                                >Spaak</persName> said that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            had recently become involved in a number of these, of which he thought
                            perhaps the Iceland case was the most important.<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d58fn5">Reference is to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                    >NATO</gloss> loan to Iceland. According to the agreement
                                reached under <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> aegis and
                                subject to later agreement on terms, the United States had stated it
                                was willing to lend $5 million to Iceland for economic and financial
                                reform. A discussion of this loan is in a briefing paper on Iceland,
                                PRS D–5/7a, undated, in Department of State, Conference Files: Lot
                                62 D 181, CF 935.</note> He expressed the hope that Iceland’s
                            conditions could be met, mostly, of course, thanks to U.S. assistance,
                            but also with the help of Germany and Canada. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> developed the thesis that no
                            Western agency suited to this type of problem exists. He characterized
                            the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> as “too technical and too
                            scientific”. He said the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> offered
                            splendid advice but Iceland wants assistance. He thought <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should develop further in this
                            economic-political field.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> also referred to the
                            difficulty of Lebanon in selling her apples and pears. He said that
                            while <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was not set up to cope with
                            problems of this type, it nevertheless had reached a solution by
                            coordinating the activities of various countries. In this case he noted
                            France and Germany purchased the fruit crop, while orders were also
                            placed by U.S. military authorities in Germany. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> said the case of disposing of the
                            Sudanese cotton crop was more difficult, because the price was high, and
                            again there was no Western organization to meet this problem.</p>
                        <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174" facs="0202"/>
                        <p>Passing to the military aspects, <persName corresp="#p_SPH1"
                                >Spaak</persName> discussed first the British forces problem. He
                            said the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> appeared ready now to leave
                            its 5,000-man strategic reserve on the continent. However, this was a
                            relatively secondary problem compared to the British conviction that, as

                            Germany could meet the mark costs. He said the other four occupying
                            countries—U.S., France, Belgium, Holland—must not take it as a precedent
                            if Germany were to meet the British request for payment of mark costs,
                            since, in that case, there would be little chance of Germany’s accepting
                            the British request. He said a grave crisis would arise if British
                            troops were withdrawn from the continent, and that the Paris and London

                            had been meeting in Paris. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>
                            noted that this task force would have a report for the December
                            Ministerial meeting, but he concluded this approach was both too vague
                            and insufficient.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> concluded his presentation,
                            saying this was an outline of the most striking problems he had found
                            since he had taken over as Secretary General five months ago. He touched
                            finally on the Cyprus question, which he said was somewhat separate. In
                            this connection, he said he had been in touch with all of the parties
                            principally interested over the past two or three months. He thought his
                            discussions had been useful in clarifying the problem and hoped that in
                            a few months more he might be able to propose a solution.</p>
                        <p>In replying to <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>, the
                            Secretary said that, first, we considered the Belgian troop reduction
                            problem as finished. He concurred in <persName corresp="#p_SPH1"
                                >Spaak</persName>’s view that disarmament discussions in <gloss
                                target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> had been useful. <pb n="175"
                                xml:id="pg_175" facs="0203"/>He thought this demonstrated an
                            encouraging capacity for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> to play a
                            role, and that this discussion had encouraged a number of nations to
                            take part in disarmament decisions when they otherwise would have played
                            no part therein. While all of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            countries were perhaps not directly concerned, most of them were,
                            particularly the Germans.</p>
                        <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we shared the view that <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> should not project itself into the Middle East and
                            that we should discourage the idea that the Baghdad Pact is a projection
                            of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He said we did not want to
                            give the Soviets an opportunity to allege that <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> had imperialist designs. He thought, therefore, we
                            should be cautious in any action with regard to what is a Middle East
                            affair. The Secretary added that we were not enthusiastic for a <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> declaration on the area, as it might
                            prove beneficial to Soviet propaganda. However, he said we would have
                            voted for such a declaration, had the other nations, particularly
                            Turkey, agreed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should attempt
                            to find solutions to politico-economic problems and said he was prepared
                            to discuss in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> at the proper time
                            how this should be done. He said many things had been discussed in the
                                <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>, and frequently most effectively
                            without publicity. He referred specifically to the purchase of Sudanese
                            cotton, and said this presented a problem because <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was not a pre-emptive buying agency,
                            and furthermore, for the U.S., there was the question of disposing of
                            our own surplus cotton. He thought, perhaps, there should be some modest
                            organization which would call these problems to the attention of the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members. For instance, he
                            thought perhaps it could be examined to see if the French could not
                            substitute Sudanese cotton purchases for those from Egypt. He said this
                            whole concept could be discussed at a future time whenever M. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> wished.</p>
                        <p>Passing to the military problems, the Secretary said he would not comment
                            on the British problem much at this time. He noted this had been
                            discussed with <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn
                                Lloyd</persName><note n="9" xml:id="d58fn9">Prime Minister <persName

                                22–25, 1957, for discussions with President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>.</note> and it was hoped
                            by the U.S. that the 5,000-man strategic reserve would be kept in
                            Europe. He said getting the Germans to pay all of the Deutschemark costs
                            of the British forces in Germany was a solution but created difficult
                            precedents. However, he thought the precedent for us would be less
                            difficult if the British need to acquire Deutschemarks were attributed
                            to foreign exchange difficulties. Germany certainly was delinquent in
                                <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0204"/>her own military build-up
                            and perhaps she should therefore contributes by paying the full British
                            Deutschemark costs.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary covered the question of contributions to <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. When the British announced in
                            December 1954 they would leave four divisions on the continent, we
                            indicated we also would keep a fair share of the total forces on the
                            continent. However, since that date, while our forces have remained
                            constant, the contributions of others have decreased. In 1954 it was
                            envisaged there would be a French contribution of 14 divisions, and 12
                            German divisions to go with the 5 American and 4 British divisions. Now
                            Germany would have only 5 divisions by the end of 1957, and the
                            Secretary noted the <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>
                            report only called for 4 French M-day divisions. Therefore, the relative
                            U.S. share has increased. Furthermore, the U.S. bears the full burden in
                            the field where only we can really contribute—missile development, etc.,
                            though there is some small British contribution. Therefore, the picture
                            was that our ground forces contribution was expected to remain unchanged
                            while others were cutting forces. Our percentage contribution to ground
                            forces was now nearly double what was envisaged in 1954. Both the French
                            and Germans have fallen short in supplying ground forces, and neither is
                            able to assist in the atomic field. The Secretary concluded that this
                            was a difficult problem for us. He referred to Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PGW1">Perkins</persName>’ statement to the Council on
                            September 18<note n="10" xml:id="d58fn10"><persName corresp="#p_PGW1"
                                    >Perkins</persName>’ September 18 statement is mentioned in

                                September 18. (Department of State, Central Files,
                                033.1100–GE/9–1857)</note> as an indication we were trying to
                            continue our emphasis unchanged, but, he reiterated, others were
                            reducing their forces.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> then referred back to
                            previous statements on the Middle East, and said the purpose of his
                            suggested <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> declaration was merely
                            to reassure Turkey, as well as European public opinion. He believed the
                            problem was somewhat altered since the <gloss target="#t_UNO1"
                                >UN</gloss> had now taken over its handling.</p>
                        <p>On the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> forces problem, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> thought this should definitely be
                            worked out as a foreign exchange question, and not a budget or general
                            financial problem. He said he would try to hold the British to their
                            commitment but noted that under the Paris Agreements, the <gloss
                                target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> could cite the foreign currency
                            situation to justify force reduction. However, the <gloss
                                target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> had not taken this step, presumably in
                            order not to cause alarm regarding sterling strength, although this was
                            the only legal basis, under the 1954 accords, to justify withdrawals. He
                            noted France could not accept <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss>
                            withdrawal from the continent, because the French had accepted German
                            rearmament under the 1954 treaties only on grounds there would be U.S.
                            and <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> forces in Germany to
                            counterbalance the expected German army.</p>

                        <p>However, <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> said, the U.S.
                            problem was the most difficult of all. <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> has not even reached the minimum figures required by
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> in his recent report.
                            He noted most of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nations were
                            lagging, especially the Germans, while the French of course were short
                            in their contribution because of Algeria. He said it was extremely hard
                            for <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> to operate with the
                            shield forces not in place.</p>
                        <p>Passing to the question of scientific research, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> said it was obviously wasteful
                            for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> to duplicate research. For
                            instance, the British and French were doing research in fields we had
                            passed some years ago. This way he said money was spent for the same
                            task in various <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries. This
                            situation must be eliminated, and research organized. <persName

                        <p>The Secretary said our discussions with the British were in terms of
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> as a whole. He agreed with the

                        <p>M. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> said the situation was
                            such now that we must attempt some dramatic steps even if they had
                            failed up to now. He reverted to his fear it would not be possible to
                            meet the requirements of the <persName corresp="#p_NGL1"
                                >Norstad</persName> report. He said he was obviously faced with the
                            possibility of the reduction of U.S. and <gloss target="#t_UKG1"
                                >UK</gloss> forces on the continent and a lessening of effort on the
                            part of the continental members; therefore, he regretfully concluded
                            that the situation was getting worse rather than better. It appeared a
                            critical difficulty was the expense involved, and economies must be
                            made.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> continued saying that three
                            years ago the <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss> had failed, but now
                            all the generals wanted integration in the military field. National
                            forces no longer were feasible. For example, it was ridiculous for there
                            to be an independent Belgian Air Force. Furthermore integration would
                            save money. The need was to have a single European Air Force. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> stated that the world situation
                            made it necessary to succeed now in endeavors we had never attempted
                            before. He said we must recapture the initiative from the Soviets.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> then suggested that, when
                            the U.S. does announce modifications of its forces on the continent,
                            this should be the time to make an eloquent plea to the European nations
                            to do more. He said he understood the U.S. problem, and hoped our
                            decisions could be used in a positive way. He said a system of national
                            priorities must be established. National markets were too small and we
                            could not afford one British plane, one French plane, etc. Sacrifices of
                            national prestige must be made or we will be unable to afford what we
                            need. <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0206"/>He noted the dangers of
                            chain reaction. He said the Belgian troops service question was
                            dangerous in this context but nothing compared to a U.S. withdrawal from
                            the continent. This, he said, would be the end of the present defense
                            system as we know it, and which the military commanders say is
                            essential.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated we continued to attach importance to the shield, and
                            added we had no plans to withdraw our forces though there may be
                            adjustments. He agreed a chain reaction should be avoided, and that the
                            Europeans should be induced to contribute more. If the other <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nations want the U.S. to lead the
                            Soviets in the missile race, then they should do more in other fields.
                            Perhaps the Soviets got ahead because the U.S. was spending too much on
                            its ground forces in Europe. He concluded that we should have
                            substantial ground forces in Europe, however, for the foreseeable
                            future, and agreed that a full-scale withdrawal would present a major
                            psychological problem.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary added another reason for more substantial European
                            contribution was the German problem. If the other Europeans wanted
                            German forces integrated, they must provide something for them to be
                            integrated with. He said it would be undesirable for the German forces
                            to exist alone. He reiterated the primary U.S. contribution should be in
                            the special fields where we have the lead.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> said we should not let the
                            idea persist in Europe that the U.S. would contribute all of the modern
                            weapons while Europe would contribute only manpower. … He also referred
                            to the problem of using scientific manpower, and asked if it would not
                            be possible to bring European scientists to the U.S. to utilize them
                            here.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> noted there had been
                            some resistance in Germany, for example, to moving their scientists
                            here, and they had the feeling their contribution should take place
                            there. He said, however, our own position was flexible. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> then referred to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>’s earlier comment that the
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> report had a
                            requirement for over … atomic units in 1963 as compared with … at
                            present. He pointed out that present U.S. law requires the nuclear
                            components to remain in U.S. hands although the delivery systems can
                            become part of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>’s armament. … He
                            thought the important point was to have the complete weapons system in
                            place. Obviously, he continued, greater strength could be achieved if
                            each contributed what he was best qualified to contribute, and in this
                            connection the primary U.S. contribution should be in the missile and
                            modern weapons field. This does not mean Europe would contribute only
                            foot soldiers; furthermore, the infantryman is no more exposed than
                            anyone else now.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> said that, as a Belgian, he
                            agreed with all of the foregoing. However, there was a problem in
                            connection with the four larger <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            European countries, who want to manufacture modern weapons <pb n="179"
                                xml:id="pg_179" facs="0207"/>themselves, and do not wish to depend
                            one hundred percent on the U.S. Therefore, others would try what the
                            British are already doing, and the French are attempting to do,
                            resulting in duplication. If this trend continued, the shield forces
                            would get thinner and thinner to the point where it would be
                            questionable if they should be retained at all. If the shield is
                            obviously insufficient, it becomes more difficult to justify. He said
                            before the war the military commanders at least thought their forces
                            were sufficient, though this proved incorrect in the French case, but
                            now the military commanders felt their minimum requirements were not
                            being met. He felt this would lead to a feeling of hopelessness.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> stated we expected to
                            maintain five divisions in Europe this fiscal year, though there would
                            be some adjustments in order that we might concentrate on the very
                            expensive items. We will assist in equipping other forces as well. We do
                            not wish to block their national programs but the outcome must be a
                            whole and not separate parts. He concluded agreeing on the importance of
                            integration in the military field.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said it was essential all members of the Alliance have full
                            trust in each other, and the other members must trust the U.S. and
                                <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> to carry out the tasks for which
                            they are best fitted. He said this spirit must pervade the Alliance.</p>
                        <p>M. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> said some of the
                            difficult and delicate tasks must be left to the Europeans. All of the
                            weapons manufacture and contribution to the infrastructure program must
                            not be left to the U.S. He said again that the answer was greater
                            military integration which would effect important savings. He then asked
                            what we had in mind for the December <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> meeting.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he hoped the present talks with <persName
                                corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> would lead to something which
                            could be projected for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He said we
                            expected to authorize Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWR1"
                                >Burgess</persName> to make an announcement very soon regarding the
                            atomic stockpile. Perhaps, he added, in December we would be in a
                            position to announce something even more far-reaching. He said there was
                            a great need to rationalize our effort, prevent duplication and effect
                            economies. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> must be organized on a
                            basis of mutual respect. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>
                            said the spirit of potential nationalism in Europe was bad and he agreed
                            each of the nations must trust others to contribute what they best
                            can.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> outlined the sample
                            weapons program of making available designs and small quantities of
                            certain advanced weapons to those who wanted them. This has thus far
                            been on bilateral basis, and agreements have been concluded with those
                            who could produce these weapons and needed them. He said conclusion of
                            multilateral agreements for this program would require additional
                            integration, which we were more than willing to see.</p>
                        <pb n="180" xml:id="pg_180" facs="0208"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> said now was perhaps the
                            time to force integration and greater cooperation among the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members. The military commanders
                            emphasize the need for strength. He thought we could speak frankly to
                            the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> and France regarding their
                            special problems. He said there was now a trend towards military
                            integration in Europe but it would be two or three years before it
                            produced many results.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary General then turned to the Cyprus question. He said he was
                            puzzled by the Greek acceptance of the proposal to make Cyprus a member
                            of the British Commonwealth. He said <persName corresp="#p_ATME1"
                                >Averoff</persName> had agreed to this with him, and had said it was
                            also acceptable to Makarios. However, he supposed the problem for the
                            Turks was the eventuality the Cypriots decided to leave the
                            Commonwealth, since they cannot accept a solution which is just a step
                            towards enosis. He thought it should be provided that if the Cypriots
                            became a member of the BC and then wished to leave, there would be a
                            conference to discuss their new status.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said the British would accept almost any solution
                            acceptable to the Greeks and Turks. He said they wished to retain a base
                            in Cyprus but also wished to be rid of the responsibility for the
                            island. He noted that the resolution of the Labor Party made it more
                            difficult for the Greeks to proceed now. However, he did not think the
                            Greeks should rely on that, because if the Labor Party came to power
                            they would have the same Turkish problem, and probably would not be able
                            to carry out their present ideas.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> said partition was a bad
                            solution, and hoped that, after the Turkish elections, Turkey would be
                            more reasonable. He also said U.S. assistance with the Turks might be
                            required. He said the British and the Greeks, especially <persName
                                corresp="#p_ATME1">Averoff</persName>, certainly wanted a solution.
                            The Secretary concluded this a dangerous problem within <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> which should be solved promptly.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said there was little to say about German reunification
                            now, because Gromyko had just told him that the Soviets would not
                            participate in any conference about Germany.<note n="11"
                                xml:id="d58fn11">The portion of the memorandum describing <persName

                            consideration of the question. The Secretary said the move to enlarge
                            the Disarmament Committee was not serious. With regard to the
                            Subcommittee, he said there also were various moves to enlarge it,
                            including the addition of a neutral chairman. He said some new formula
                            for proceeding <pb n="181" xml:id="pg_181" facs="0209"/>was being

                        <p>The President opened the conversation by expressing his faith and
                            confidence in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He felt that
                            things are looking much better for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> agreed. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> said he was very much struck by
                            the replies of the European Socialist Parties to <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s recent letters.<note n="2"

                                preserve peace in the Middle East.</note> He said that certainly no

                            good.</p>
                        <p>In reply to the President’s question about the progress toward European
                            integration, <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> said that
                            things are going well in connection with the Common Market and <gloss

                            <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> replied in the negative,
                            saying that consideration by the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>
                            of the free trade area in Paris recently produced very good

                                with the six-nation European Common Market.</note> The Secretary
                            explained <pb n="182" xml:id="pg_182" facs="0210"/>that some people are
                            worried that the British might use the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                >GATT</gloss> to nullify the effects expected from the Common
                            Market. He said it is our opinion the Common Market must be preserved at
                            all cost, with or without a free trade area.</p>
                        <p>There was some discussion of the economic situation in Germany and
                            France, the President remarking that the Germans are increasing their
                            gold reserves while those of France are falling. The President observed
                            that France is most strategically located in the heart of Europe and
                            that economic problems, accentuated by the Algerian situation, have
                            produced a grave situation. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> said he had talked to <persName
                                corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> today about Algeria and
                            that the latter had informed him that the British will vote with France
                            on the Algerian matter in the United Nations.<note n="5" xml:id="d59fn5"
                                >A memorandum of this conversation of October 25 is scheduled for
                                publication in the compilation on the United Kingdom in a
                                forthcoming <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volume.</note>
                            The Secretary said that we and the British had recently told the
                            Tunisians jointly that we would supply the arms that the Tunisian
                            Government had requested. We felt that if the two of us took this action
                            there was less possibility of France “lashing out” at either of us. He
                            was glad to note that the situation had quieted down along the
                            Tunisian-Algerian border and hoped this would provide the opportunity to
                            solve this particular problem to the satisfaction of France and Tunisia.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> felt that the French
                            had made a mistake in not using Bourguiba, who is obviously ready to
                            play along with the West and with France.…</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that it is
                            very fortunate that <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> is here
                            at the same time as Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1"
                                >Macmillan</persName>. The purpose of the meeting with <persName
                                corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> was not to forge an
                            Anglo-American alliances, but to strengthen our alliances everywhere and
                            particularly the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This fact is being
                            pointed up in the joint declaration to be issued later in the day<note

                                corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>. The President said he was very
                            glad to have Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> in
                            Washington at this time, since a purpose of the meeting with <persName
                                corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> was to devise ways and means
                            of strengthening <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and giving
                            greater confidence to the peoples of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> countries. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1"
                                >Spaak</persName> said that it is important to give the impression
                            that all of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is interested in these
                            matters.…</p>
                        <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> said that if the United
                            States reduces its ground forces in Europe in the near future it would
                            have a very bad reaction in Europe. He was assured by the President
                            that, while the number <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0211"/>of men
                            in divisions might be reduced, there will be no reduction in actual
                            strength for a long time. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1"
                                >Spaak</persName> recommended that the United States make a very
                            strong statement in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> regarding the
                            “fair share” concept. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> said that we had made such a statement in London,
                            based on the assumption that the various countries in Europe would
                            supply their share of the forces.<note n="7" xml:id="d59fn7">Reference

                                    Part 2, p. 1357</ref>.</note> The Germans will only produce five
                            divisions by the end of this year, the French apparently are down to
                            four divisions, and the British are reducing their forces. As a
                            consequence, we are now supplying two times our share of European
                            defense. The President said that six or seven years ago there was fear
                            of a resurgent Germany; now we are very anxious to get them to make a
                            greater effort in the military field. If the European Defense Community
                            Treaty had been adopted, he said, there would be no trouble today. He
                            felt that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> now has a
                            mandate from the people and should be able to move ahead more quickly.
                            He agreed that nothing should be done which might hurt morale in Europe,
                            but said the Europeans do not seem to remember the conditions on which
                            our troops were sent to Europe, namely, until such time as the French
                            and German forces were built up to adequate strength. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> felt the time had come to say
                            these things in the North Atlantic Council, and he cautioned against
                            basing any reductions in Europe on purely budgetary reasons. The
                            President expressed the belief that if the Algerian question could be
                            settled, these problems in central Europe would solve themselves.</p>
                        <p>The President said he had recently seen <persName corresp="#p_MGFJ1"
                                >Malagodi</persName>, head of the Italian Liberal Party, who had
                            told him that Soviet intervention in Hungary, in fact, had helped the
                            Communist Party in Italy.<note n="8" xml:id="d59fn8">The memorandum of

                            Soviet Union had impressed many Italians. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1"

                            Europe. He thought this was extremely important psychologically. He said
                            he had just met with Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_MENH1"
                                >McElroy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_QDA1"

                            told them that, if a cut were made into U.S. combat elements at this
                            time, such action would constitute a <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> incident even greater that the British action of a
                            year ago. A few men could be cut out but the battle group should not be
                            reduced.</p>
                        <p>The President recalled that we have five divisions and four separate
                            regiments in Europe and that it has been agreed not to cut these but to
                            cut out some headquarters and support units. In fact, he felt we were
                            augmenting our fighting strength. On the point of cutting out
                            headquarters, <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">General Norstad</persName>
                            reported that he is consolidating two Air Force headquarters (USAFE and
                            12th Air Force). He is trying to do the same for the Army, and is also
                            cutting out one <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> echelon of
                            command. In addition, he is turning back a large portion of the tactical
                            air units since tactical missiles are now displacing them. He said he
                            had asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName> to agree
                            that, if it becomes necessary to cut manpower, he (<persName
                                corresp="#p_NGL1">General Norstad</persName>) would have the right
                            to decide where the cuts should be made. He felt that now is no time to
                            make substantial cuts in units in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.
                            He recognizes that no one can plan in detail as far ahead as 1961.</p>
                        <pb n="185" xml:id="pg_185" facs="0213"/>
                        <p>The President agreed that we should not deal in figures so far ahead. He
                            thought that Defense should give <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">General
                                Norstad</persName> a reasonable quota of men, but should not attempt
                            to say which specific units or organizations should be cut out.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">General Norstad</persName> conclude on
                            this point by saying that we now have a plan that will unify <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>—something they can believe in.</p>
                        <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>The President said that we ought to search out every useless expenditure,
                            and added that personnel is basically the most expensive category. He
                            felt that once Defense had specified cuts to be made, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGL1">General Norstad</persName> should say where they
                            would be achieved, but should also make clear that our military power is
                            constantly growing. <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">General
                                Norstad</persName> said we could do this very effectively, since the
                            power of our units is increasing; he added, however, that the Russians
                            are increasing their total power at the same time, so that relatively
                            the position is by no means so clear.</p>
                        <p>The President said he had thought it a good idea to organize small atomic
                            groups which might form a theater-wide organization under <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGL1">General Norstad</persName>’s control. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGL1">General Norstad</persName> suggested that I should
                            look at a message he had sent to the Chiefs of Staff on this
                                matter.<note n="4" xml:id="d60fn4">Not further
                            identified.</note></p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NGL1">General Norstad</persName> suggested that, if
                            the President visits Paris this fall, he should stay at his former
                            quarters in Marnes-la-Coquette. The President indicated that he would
                            get in touch with <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">General Norstad</persName>
                            and see what action would be best if he should decide to go. It might be
                            simplest for him to stay in the Embassy, particularly considering that
                            he would probably not be in Paris for the full meeting. After further
                            thought, he said that if Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> accompanies him, he might well take <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGL1">General Norstad</persName> up on the offer.</p>
                        <p>In concluding the session, <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">General
                                Norstad</persName> stressed strongly that if the President comes to
                            the meeting, he must have something firm and definite to say. It would
                            not be effective simply to come and put out a communiqué. In this
                            connection, he said that although the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> stockpile idea is no longer new, that could be the
                            announcement the President would make.<note n="5" xml:id="d60fn5">In a
                                memorandum of conversation of October 28, <persName

                                end of the conversation with <persName corresp="#p_NGL1"
                                    >Norstad</persName> and that they spoke briefly about the
                                communiqué which had been drafted by the Department of State for
                                presentation to the heads of government at the December <gloss

                                    corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> noted: “I said <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> might not be enthusiastic
                                about the aspect of it which sought to create a greater
                                acceptability of long range striking power—the ‘sword’ as against
                                the ‘shield.’ I gave Korea as an illustration of the need. <persName

                                with that but felt that each situation had to be judged on its own
                                merits. We spoke briefly of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                    >NATO</gloss> ‘stockpile’ and <persName corresp="#p_NGL1"
                                    >General Norstad</persName> expressed the opinion that having

                            Chancellor, before which I had an hour’s conversation alone with him.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>, though invited, felt
                            Chancellor might talk more informally and freely if he were not present
                            and so excused himself. Chancellor referred first to the great
                            importance of the coming meeting,<note n="3" xml:id="d61fn3"><persName

                            inspiration must come—if not, this would be the end of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, to use his words. He felt it
                            essential that steps be taken to integrate <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> better. The vertical organization was complicated and
                            the appearance of a unified force was given, but the reality was a
                            number of separate national forces. It was nonsense that there was not a
                            United European air force, French, German, Dutch, Belgian, operating
                            under <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The whole thing should be
                            organized as <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss> was planned air and
                            ground combined and integrated force. As presently organized, it would
                            all collapse before a Russian attack.</p>
                        <p>Next he talked of the great need for political consultation in <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He was critical of US policy, which
                            on several occasions had brought <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            close to the risk of war without consultation with those whose interests
                            and strength were allied with ours—witness Suez, the Jordan air lift,
                            Tunisia, etc. He referred also to the turning down of financial help to
                            Turkey which he claimed the USSR was now providing for industrial
                            development. There should be political consultation in <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> with the American representative of
                            course taking the lead. He complained that there was no long range
                            knowledge or authority reposing in the American representative to deal
                            with serious developments. <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                                >Adenauer</persName> seemed to think the President should bring
                            forth proposals in this field at the forthcoming meeting.</p>
                        <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0215"/>
                        <p>Next, he strongly stressed the air of doubt surrounding US participation
                            and interest in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> as a result of the
                            military-scientific advances of the USSR. He brought up <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s attempts to split the
                            Western alliance and then proposed that the period of the treaty now
                            prescribed for twenty years i.e. approximately 10 years from now, be
                            extended at the forthcoming meeting so that the opportunity for
                            denunciation under Article 13 be postponed till 1978.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d61fn4">Article 13 of the North Atlantic Treaty noted that
                                after the accord had been in force for 20 years, any party might
                                cease to be a member 1 year after notice had been given to the
                                United States, which would inform other members.</note> This he
                            thought would breathe new life into the treaty, discourage attempts of
                            the Russians to break it apart, and generally be about the best answer
                            possible to growing doubts and skepticism as to the vigor of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He would urge that the President
                            propose this. He would support it and he thought France would. He had
                            talked about this with <persName>Maurice Faure</persName> of France, who
                            he said was in favor of it. By doing this, the whole problem of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would be removed from discussion both
                            in international and national politics.</p>
                        <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>He liked the idea of the President’s reiteration of adherence to <gloss

                            institutes and some comforting comments on fundamental US economic

                            we discussed and which I shall briefly touch upon in the following
                            paragraphs.</p>
                        <p>You may well imagine that I am much concerned about certain aspects of
                            the present situation. By this I am referring to the occasional
                            disaccord which makes itself felt within the alliance, to the
                            psychological uncertainty resulting from the launching of the Sputnik
                            and to the deficiencies appearing in our military organization. The
                            forthcoming Ministerial Meeting on top level must, if it is to be of any
                            purpose at all, provide the basis for a very substantial reform, the
                            details of which the Council may decide upon at subsequent meetings.</p>
                        <p>First I feel that a strong reaffirmation of the Atlantic Alliance and its
                            moral and political aims would be urgently required. It might perhaps be
                            desirable, over and above the reaffirmation of the existing alliance, to
                            make some gesture which would demonstrate that any hope of our
                            adversaries for a disintegration of this alliance is [in] vain. This
                            could be done by the Heads of Government, headed by the President of the
                            United States, expressing their unanimous will to make no use of the
                            possibility to be released from their obligations after ten years. It
                            should be made clear to the world that this alliance is not conditioned
                            by any prevailing situation but that in any case it has grown into a
                            genuine and lasting political community. In my opinion we need such an
                            affirmation of the durability of our alliance beyond 1968 because only
                            in this way we can convince our peoples that, indeed, we attach very
                            great importance to common efforts in the field of fundamental and
                            applied research, the result of which can only be obtained within very
                            long periods of time.</p>
                        <p>For the same reasons it is so important that the forthcoming <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting reaffirms and extends the
                            obligation of member countries to mutual consultation. Unfortunately we
                            had to learn that the decisions of last year based upon the report of
                            the Three Wise Men<note n="4" xml:id="d62fn4">Regarding the Report of
                                the Committee of Three on Non-Military Co-Operation in <gloss

                            not always been complied with. We must endeavour to change this.
                            Particularly Article 4 of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                                Treaty<note n="5" xml:id="d62fn5">Article 4 stipulated that the

                                threatened.</note> should be so interpreted that a genuine
                            obligation to consult is established in all cases in which political,
                            economic or military actions of a member country might lead to conflicts
                            which would directly or indirectly bring one or all of us into the
                            danger of grave complications. Never before have there been so numerous
                            causes of conflict in the world. They are apt to put the alliance within
                            a few hours before the question of war or peace. Only if we mutually
                            agree in time and before-hand <pb n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0217"
                            />on all existing possibilities, can we preserve unity and prevent the
                            alliance from disintegrating in the face of a question vital to us
                            all.</p>
                        <p>It must therefore be our aim to bring about to an ever increasing extent
                            a common foreign policy in all questions decisively touching upon the
                            fate of the community and its partners, and this should be a foreign
                            policy which is supported by all member countries and which can be
                            accounted for in their parliaments and before public opinion.</p>
                        <p>It will be necessary in this connexion to give the Permanent
                            Representatives of the member countries to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> Council more powers and more comprehensive
                            instructions. They must always feel themselves empowered, especially
                            during acute crises, to take part in the formulation of proposals and to
                            negotiate thereon. For this purpose they should be in particularly close
                            contacts with their cabinets.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore we should seek closer military cooperation. In this connexion
                            the consequence should be drawn from the dangers arising from the
                            present world situation and from the advance of technical achievements
                            that no nation is any longer in the position to act alone and that,
                            therefore, any country must fall in line with the others even if this
                            would mean giving up certain sovereign rights.</p>
                        <p>In this connexion I would name some especially urgent and concrete
                            examples: <list>

                            </list></p>
                        <p>We probably all agree that we must considerably increase the efforts of
                            the Atlantic Community in the field of scientific research and
                            technology by long term planning. I therefore feel that political and
                            military cooperation should be accompanied by joint research. Here, too,
                            a genuine distribution of tasks should be made. In particular it would
                            be the task of the European member countries of the Alliance to form
                            certain centres of activities in some fields of research and thus to
                            contribute to a lessening of the burden on the United States.</p>
                        <p>However important a reaffirmation and a strengthening of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defence preparedness are, the
                            consultations and results of the Ministerial Meeting at top level should
                            not be of an exclusively military nature, for this would only provide
                            the opportunity to Soviet propaganda to mark us as “war mongers” and to
                            distort and to falsify our aims. Therefore, I feel that it would be of
                            utmost importance that in the declaration at the end of the Ministerial
                            Meeting suggested <pb n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0218"/>by Mr.

                            coexistence of all peoples. In this declaration we should also address
                            the peoples of the non-committed world who expect from our meeting a
                            convincing interpretation of our relations with them.</p>
                        <p>I am very glad to see the President and yourself in Paris again in order
                            to consider these and other questions in the customary atmosphere of
                            friendship and mutual trust.</p>

                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brentano</persName> said that
                            he was anxious to exchange views with the Secretary on matters which
                            will be the subject of discussion and action at the December meeting of
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He said that he had talked to
                                <persName>Maurice Faure</persName> in Paris before <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCP1">Pineau</persName> came to the United States and
                            had talked more recently to Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_PG1"
                                >Pella</persName> in Italy. He was glad to say that there had been a
                            large measure of agreement on basic questions.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he would like to express some thoughts on <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>’s basic problems. The <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries face a threat directed by a
                            single will, the Soviet Communist leadership. Soviet Communism controls
                            one-third of the people of the world. It has a freedom of action which
                            we do not enjoy and which does not respond <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191"
                                facs="0219"/>to any moral control or to public opinion. This creates
                            a most difficult problem for the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            countries to meet. We cannot pool all of our sovereignties and work as a
                            single unit but must find a way to concert our efforts within the limits
                            inherent in the situation. He referred to U.S. relations with various
                            organizations such as the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>, <gloss
                                target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and other bilateral ties involving
                            some forty-two nations in all. We cannot give a veto power to each of
                            the forty-two countries because this would result in immobility. We must
                            find a middle ground.</p>
                        <p>We cannot, for example, agree <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to act without
                            consultation in the North Atlantic Council, for two reasons. We do not
                            wish publicly to give the impression that <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> has primacy over the rest of the world, although this
                            may be true de facto, since it is the most vital alliance and offers us
                            the greatest support. Also, we must sometimes act very quickly and,
                            while we are anxious to see the North Atlantic Council develop into a
                            useful consultative body, we do not wish to have our capacity for action
                            destroyed. We feel that all members of the Council should be prepared to
                            discuss policies in all parts of the world, but the requirement for
                            taking action may sometimes prevent us from consulting beforehand. For
                            example, though some thought was given to rejecting a recent Soviet note
                            on the Middle East which we considered to be insulting to the United
                                States,<note n="2" xml:id="d63fn2">For text of the Soviet note of
                                September 3, 1957, which condemned the use of force in the Middle
                                East, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>,
                                October 14, 1957, pp. 602–603.</note> it was decided to discuss the
                            matter in the North Atlantic Council. Obviously the appropriate moment
                            for returning the note to the Soviets, if we had wished to do so, would
                            have been lost as a result of long consultation in the Council. This was
                            not an important matter but served only as an illustration.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary referred to the Tunisian arms question, relating the
                            development of events from September to November 12 when the French
                            agreed to supply arms to Tunis. Unfortunately, the French proposed a
                            condition to the Tunisians which the latter could not accept. Perhaps
                            this was a wise move on the part of <persName corresp="#p_GF1"
                                >Gaillard</persName> who apparently felt that his Government would
                            fall. The Secretary said it would have been impossible to bring these
                            matters before the North Atlantic Council.</p>
                        <p>We have a practical problem of trying to hold together about fifty free
                            nations in the Near East, the Far East and elsewhere. The machinery is
                            only good if it works and does not impede progress. We have made good
                            progress in the North Atlantic Council but it should be borne in mind
                            that it is not always practicable to discuss everything on a
                            multilateral basis. Sometimes matters are better discussed <pb n="192"
                                xml:id="pg_192" facs="0220"/>bilaterally, particularly since some of
                            the North Atlantic countries may not be able to make any contributions.
                            We must have the confidence and trust of our allies if we are to
                            exercise the power which we have to give leadership to the
                            organization.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            is a most dangerous and unpredictable individual, unlike Stalin, and he
                            can be opposed only by an ability to act quickly. We are not asking for
                            a blank check from our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners
                            but, he pointed out, if we wait in all cases to consult them before
                            reacting to Soviet maneuvers the opportunity to make a riposte might
                            vanish.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brentano</persName> said he agreed with the
                            Secretary’s analysis. The Eastern bloc is united by force and by fear.
                            Never before was there as powerful or unpredictable a figure as
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> at the helm in
                            Russia controlling both the party and the army. This makes for a
                            psychological malaise in the free world. Now we are approaching a summit
                            meeting of the North Atlantic Council with a very short time to prepare
                            for it. It must be a success; it would be very demoralizing if the
                            public received the impression that nothing had happened at such a
                            meeting.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brentano</persName> said that the United
                            States plays the essential role in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            and that no one wants to restrict U.S. action. He realized that the
                            United States has gigantic obligations. The problem is how to establish
                            a common policy and how to bind the others in a partnership in the
                            organization. In no case would Germany wish to restrict United States
                            freedom of action. He was thinking in terms of what can be done to make
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> active by coordinating the
                            policies of its members in various areas. He referred here particularly
                            to the 1948 Treaty of Bogota which set up an organ of consultation and
                            which might provide a formula acceptable to the European countries which
                            would oblige them to consult under certain conditions and circumstances.
                            He said that discussion in the North Atlantic Council had not been too
                            profitable and that <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Blankenhorn</persName>’s
                            reports of the Council meetings were very depressing.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that perhaps we can do more than has been done in the
                            past about consultation. He recalled that in the spring of 1956 he had
                            appealed to the Council for action to strengthen the consultative
                            process and the Three Wise Men exercise had resulted. We were
                            disappointed in the outcome of the Wise Men’s report. The recent
                            appearance of the Soviet Sputniks may have the good result of impelling
                            us to do things which could not be done before because we were not
                            sufficiently aroused.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the United States is not alarmed at recent
                            developments in the Soviet Union. We had known all along that the USSR
                            was developing a scientific military base and we cannot stop Russia from
                            becoming an increasingly important military and scientific <pb n="193"
                                xml:id="pg_193" facs="0221"/>power. Perhaps we had made a mistake in
                            not publishing more about our knowledge of this situation which now has
                            taken people by surprise. We must strike back and we have the will and
                            the means to do so. The launching of the Soviet satellites may prove
                            costly to the Soviets in that they have created a condition in which the
                            free world is now willing to move further in the direction of
                            unification.</p>
                        <p>The meeting was then adjourned to the State Department where the
                            discussion was resumed later.<note n="3" xml:id="d63fn3">See the

                        <p>The Secretary said he had already expressed, in the previous conversation
                            in his home,<note n="2" xml:id="d64fn2">See the memorandum of
                                conversation, <ref target="#d63"><hi rend="italic"
                                >supra</hi></ref>.</note> his great satisfaction that Herr <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName> had been able to come to
                            Washington for a discussion of the forthcoming <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> meeting. As he had said in his earlier discussion with
                            Herr <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName>, he knew that
                            the two Governments were in agreement on objectives. It was useful to
                            discuss how to give effect to these objectives. He know that the German
                            Federal Government wished to contribute to the success of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting. The United States wanted to
                            learn of the German ideas. For his part, he would be glad to inform Herr
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName> of the American
                            ideas as they had developed to date.</p>

                            Meeting</hi></p>
                        <p>Herr <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName> suggested that he
                            should begin by explaining the German ideas. He could say what the
                            Federal Government and the Chancellor in particular thought about the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting. In doing so, he did
                            not wish to prejudice the discussions which would take place at the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meetings. He thought it would
                            be useful, however, to lay before the Secretary and members of his staff
                            the general ideas of the German Government on the subject.</p>
                        <p>Herr <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName> said that the
                            meeting was awaited with great expectation by the free world. Much would
                            be expected from the meeting. The German Government did not feel that
                            the meeting should deal exclusively or even primarily with military
                            matters. The <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Governments should
                            make clear that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> desires to seek a
                            peaceful solution to the problems confronting the world. Concrete ways
                            should be found to reach these objectives. The declaration issued at the
                            meeting should lay stress on the common purpose of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries in seeking freedom,
                            independence, and the preservation of national integrity of all peoples.
                            It should also refer to our relations with the Soviet Union. The public
                            should be informed that the Heads of Government had come together not
                            just because of technical developments but because of the failure of the
                            disarmament talks. It should be made clear that the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Governments are ready to proceed with
                            disarmament when agreement is reached on controls. Such a declaration
                            would appeal not only to public opinion in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> countries, but also to the under-developed
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Herr <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName> said that he
                            would like to outline what the German Government thought could be done
                            in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Community. He suggested
                            that the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>–<persName

                                    59</ref>.</note> could serve as a model for the declaration to
                            be issued at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting. He
                            thought that is should deal with the following points.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Political Consultation in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                    >NATO</gloss></hi></p>
                        <p>The first was political consultation. Herr <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von
                                Brentano</persName> said there should be no misunderstanding on this
                            point. The <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Governments must
                            emphasize that they have a common policy and that more will be done in
                            this field in the future than heretofore. It must be emphasized that
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is more than a military
                            alliance. He said that the Germans knew that consultation must be
                            noncommittal as to certain areas. He did not feel that any institutional
                            changes were necessary in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, nor did
                            he contemplate that at the end of discussion <pb n="195" xml:id="pg_195"
                                facs="0223"/>in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> there would be
                            any voting. However, something must be done to remind the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Governments that they must do more.
                            There must be no more unpleasant surprises. He suggested that Article 39
                            of the Bogota Treaty could serve as an example of what might be
                                done.<note n="4" xml:id="d64fn4">Reference is to the Charter of the
                                Organization of American States, concluded at the Ninth
                                International Conference of American States at Bogotá, Colombia, on
                                March 30, 1948.</note> The provisions of this Treaty provided for
                            effective consultation without committing governments beyond what could
                            realistically be asked.</p>
                        <p>Herr <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName> said that the
                            powers of the permanent representatives to <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> should be enlarged. They should receive instructions
                            from their governments which would enable them to engage in meaningful
                            consultation. The powers of the Secretary General should also be
                            enlarged as had been proposed last December. He should be authorized to
                            get in touch with the individual member governments, to ask questions,
                            and to take a greater degree of initiative.</p>
                        <p>Herr <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName> said these steps
                            would help to form a common policy and would remove the feeling which
                            exists in many quarters that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is
                            disintegrating. He said that reports which had been received from the
                            Annual Review made clear that we could not go on as we had up to now.
                            The Secretary asked Herr <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von
                                Brentano</persName> to elaborate on this last remark. Herr <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName> said that the reports which
                            the German Government had received on the Annual Review were very
                            depressing. There was a let-down in the military effort. In saying this,
                            he did not omit the Federal Republic, which he recognized had neglected
                            to do things in the past which should have been done. In the Annual
                            Review one country after another was appearing to say that it could not
                            do this and that. There is a lack of common will on the part of the
                            Europeans to defend themselves. He remarked that they could not of
                            course do this without American help.</p>

                        <p>Herr <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName> said that the
                            second main subject which should be dealt with was basic research. The
                            French had made a proposal on this subject, for which he wished to
                            express the support of the Federal Government. Great changes had taken
                            place within the world. The Soviet Union has enormous resources of money
                            and manpower. Fortunately, the United States also had such resources.
                            Europe, too, could make a contribution in this respect, but the
                            individual European states were too small to do this by themselves. They
                            should therefore agree on a program of common research going beyond
                            national boundaries. The center of this effort must, however, be the
                            United States. Herr <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName>
                            said that this proposal was <pb n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0224"/>not
                            put forward for selfish motives. It was essential that research, both
                            basic and applied, be carried on. However, the Europeans could carry it
                            on only in cooperation with the United States. He knew that there were
                            difficulties of a legal character in the United States, but difficulties
                            existed to be overcome.</p>
                        <p>Herr <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName> said he had
                            discussed this matter with Signor <persName corresp="#p_PG1"
                                >Pella</persName>, who was in agreement. He believed that the <gloss
                                target="#t_Benelux1">Benelux</gloss> Governments would also agree.
                            The idea was to establish a European center of armament research, which
                            could be directed to those matters of particular interest to European
                            countries. He cited by way of example the development of an intermediate
                            range missile with a range of 2000 kilometers. Herr <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName> said that the Europeans did
                            not wish to compete with the United States, but rather to relieve the
                            United States of some of its burdens. However, they could only do this
                            with the help of the United States. He realized that the matter could
                            not be settled at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting.
                            There was for example the question of the protection of security, which
                            was extremely important. However, agreement should be reached on the
                            principle. Its application could be worked out in a meeting of Foreign
                            Ministers at a later time.</p>

                        <p>Herr <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName> said that the
                            third principal point which should be dealt with at the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting was the subject of military
                            organization. We should try to reach a greater measure of integration in
                            some fields. For example, there still are separate French, Belgium, and
                            Dutch air forces. He said this was medieval. We could no longer afford
                            to have separate forces. More should be done also in the way of
                            standardization of weapons. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> could
                            make recommendations and put pressure on the Governments to do more.
                            There could be sharing of tasks. There should also be greater
                            integration in training.</p>
                        <p>Herr <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName> said that another
                            subject in this field was that of the Supreme Command. He did not doubt
                            the competence of the members of the Standing Group. However, they were
                            too dependent on their governments. The Standing Group should be given
                            greater independence. As matters now stand, they do not think in terms
                            of the alliance as a whole.</p>

                            wished to speak about atomic weapons. He said that the Federal Republic

                        <p>Herr <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName> said he would
                            also like to make some comments on procedure to be followed at the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting. The Federal Republic
                            thinks that the meeting should not take up the routine matters normally
                            dealt with at the December Ministerial meeting. The Annual Review
                            resolution should be approved before the meeting. He suggested that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">General Norstad</persName> should give a
                            briefing on the present military situation and on the measures which
                            needed to be taken. Finally, all member governments should give the
                            Secretary General in advance of the meeting a basic outline of the
                            proposals they would make.</p>
                        <p>Herr <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName> said that he
                            would give the Secretary on the following day a separate paper covering
                            the points which he had outlined.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary thanked Herr <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von
                                Brentano</persName> for the expression of his views. He thought that
                            his own thinking was very much in harmony with what Herr <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName> had expressed. He said he
                            would like to comment on some of the specific suggestions which had been
                            made and perhaps to add a few thoughts of his own. The Secretary said he
                            agreed it was of the utmost importance that the declaration to be made
                            at the meeting should not deal exclusively with military matters and
                            that it should indicate the great concern of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Governments for the peace,
                            independence, and welfare of all peoples. The world situation should be
                            put in true perspective. People forget what has happened. They have
                            heard a great deal of propaganda about <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> being an aggressor military bloc. We should explain
                            again why <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> came into being. The
                            primary reason was because the Soviets used their veto to prevent the
                            Security Council from exercising its functions. Had the Security Council
                            been able to function effectively, there would be no need for regional
                            security organizations. The United Nations Charter had contemplated this
                            possibility and had left open the alternative of the establishment of
                            regional organizations. The immediate reasons for establishing <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> were, of course, the Soviet actions
                            in Greece, Czechoslovakia, and Berlin and, following the signature of
                            the Treaty but before the organization was established, the attack on
                            the Republic of Korea.</p>
                        <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0226"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was
                            designed to meet the threats which had been made by the Soviet Union
                            against various countries, a situation which had continued up to the
                            present and to some degree had been intensified. One <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> country after another had been
                            threatened with attack if it did not submit to the will of the Soviet
                            Union. It was only for these reasons that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> countries had banded together to protect
                            themselves.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he thought there was another point which should
                            be made in the declaration, which had been mentioned in the letter from
                            Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> which Herr
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName> had given him.
                            There had been brought together in this way in the Atlantic Community a
                            group of countries which had ties which went back many centuries. They
                            were bound together by ties of race, culture, and religion. We should
                            look on this organization as something going beyond its original
                            purposes and as a permanent drawing together of the nations of the North
                            Atlantic Community. The dates which were specified in the Treaty were
                            not really of significance. We should look on <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> as a more or less permanent organization.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Disarmament</hi></p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he thought the idea suggested by Herr <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName> of referring in the
                            declaration to the failure of the disarmament talks was a good one. We
                            should make clear where the responsibility for this failure lies and our
                            readiness at all times to agree to disarmament provided it is controlled
                            and that there are no adverse political effects. He said that it was his
                            own personal conviction, which he was not certain it was wise to reflect
                            in the communiqué, that it was extremely difficult to bring about
                            disarmament in the face of injustices in the world, such as the division
                            of Germany. Such injustices, whether we like it or not, contain the germ
                            or at least the possibility of war. The Eastern European countries are
                            kept under control by the Soviet Union only by military might.
                            Situations like this make it very difficult to see how agreement on
                            disarmament can be reached. History indicates that one does not obtain
                            disarmament unless there is confidence. Disarmament must be voluntary.
                            It cannot be imposed. The Secretary cited the Washington Arms Conference
                            as an example. The United States, which was desirous of disarmament,
                            actually went below the armament levels fixed by the Treaty. Japan, on
                            the other hand exceeded them, although this process was concealed. In
                            this particular case, the limitations were rather simple and dealt with
                            identifiable units.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said it was his conviction that it was very difficult to
                            separate the problem of limitation of arms from the settlement of some
                            of the political problems which are a danger to the peace or, in the
                            case of the Soviet Union, are the very reasons for the maintenance <pb
                                n="199" xml:id="pg_199" facs="0227"/>of armaments. However, it may
                            be possible to find some areas where we could agree to some limited
                            disarmament.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said it would be impossible to go into this matter in
                            detail at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting. The
                            declaration should say that we stand on the London position and should
                            point out that disarmament rarely comes about in the kind of political
                            situation which now exists or through a world body.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Negotiations with the Soviet Union</hi></p>
                        <p>The Secretary said the declaration should also mention the obstacles in
                            the way of negotiating a settlement with the Soviet Union in view of its
                            long record of broken promises. There is a feeling in some countries,
                            which is cultivated by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            and Soviet propaganda, that this is a terribly long and hard process and
                            costs lots of money. People wonder why we can’t achieve relaxation of
                            tensions some easier way. The difficulty is that the price which the
                            Soviets attach is very high. In the case of Germany, the Secretary said
                            he could not imagine an agreement except on terms which would give the
                            Soviet Zone regime the possibility, even the probability, of controlling
                            all of Germany. The Soviets terms would involve leaving all of Eastern
                            Europe under their control. The conditions which they would require in
                            the Far East would mean Soviet and Chinese Communist control over the
                            Pacific area. Furthermore, we would have no assurance that they would
                            not use these advances as a basis for going further. This was, in fact,
                            what had happened at Yalta. They had been given an advanced position.
                            They broke their promises and used this agreement as a basis for further
                            advances.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said there were some people in the West who were so eager
                            for relief from burdens that they were inclined to engage in wishful
                            thinking. We should take the occasion of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> meeting to make clear that we would like nothing
                            better than to achieve tranquility. However, unless and until the
                            Soviets showed more indication of willingness to observe their promises
                            than they have in the past, it would be reckless indeed to look to such

                        <p>The Secretary said he thought the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            meeting should also have a look at economic problems. He did not think
                            that one should try to make <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> into
                            an economic body. There were useful economic bodies such as the <gloss
                                target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_CSC1"
                                >CSC</gloss> already in existence, and there would soon be the
                            Common Market and the Free Trade Area. He did not think that <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would be a good instrument to use for
                            giving aid to under-developed countries. It was under suspicion as being
                            under the influence of the colonial countries. He <pb n="200"
                                xml:id="pg_200" facs="0228"/>thought it would be useful, however, to
                            indicate the concern of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            Governments that the new nations should be able to achieve economic
                            independence; the declaration might call on the member governments to
                            give assistance to these nations.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Cold War Aspects of Economic Problems</hi></p>
                        <p>The Secretary said another subject which might be looked at was what
                            might be called the cold-war aspects of economic problems. Perhaps
                            something could be done to improve our organization for coping with such
                            problems as Icelandic fish, Lebanese apples, and Sudanese cotton. These
                            were situations where the action required in itself was not expensive
                            but failure to act might be very expensive in terms of its cost to
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. It might be useful to have a
                            committee of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> charged with this
                            type of problem. The Secretary remarked that he was expressing largely
                            his personal views. The staff work on the preparations for the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting had not been completed, and
                            he was expressing thoughts which were novel to his associates, who would
                            no doubt tell him they were not workable. While this might be so, he
                            thought the discussion would be more fruitful if it proceeded in this
                            vein.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Political Consultation in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                    >NATO</gloss></hi></p>
                        <p>Turning to the subject of political consultation, the Secretary said that
                            he thought progress had been made in this field as a result of the
                            report of the Three Wise Men, but primarily as a result of the Suez
                            crisis. This crisis was an object lesson in the results which could flow
                            from some of our associates striking out on their own, knowing they
                            could not count on our support. The United States had tried, perhaps not
                            wholly adequately, to be loyal to the concept of political consultation.
                            He thought we had contributed considerably to the process. We had tried
                            to keep our representative in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            fully informed, although we had not always been able to do so. No doubt
                            we could do better. The Secretary said he had remarked to M. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCP1">Pineau</persName> that this was a subject on which
                            it was hard to prescribe rules. What is necessary is to make political
                            consultation a habit. Acquiring this habit had its own problems for us
                            in Washington. We were farther away from the Council than other
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would welcome suggestions as to ways for more
                            intimate consultation. However, he did not think we could or should be
                            asked to consult to a degree which would make it impossible for us to
                            act promptly and decisively in case of need. We would not act promptly
                            and decisively except pursuant to policies known to our Allies. However,
                            there are situations in which promptness is essential. We could not be
                            tied down to such a degree that we could not act for a couple of weeks
                            while leisurely consultation was going <pb n="201" xml:id="pg_201"
                                facs="0229"/>on in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Sometimes
                            within that time the situation would have developed to a point where the
                            only remedy was general war. The enemy might be engaged in a probing
                            action. If this were promptly met, he would draw back. If it were not
                            dealt with promptly he might have committed his prestige to an extent
                            which would make it difficult or impossible to draw back. The Secretary
                            said he thought this point was of particular importance in relation to
                            Berlin, which he regarded as a great danger spot. The Soviets were
                            pushing at us more and more. The time might well come when we would have
                            to act quickly and strongly in Berlin.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that we have heavy responsibilities in other
                            parts of the world. We had taken certain action, for example, in the
                            Formosan Straits. He was aware of the fact that we had been criticized
                            for doing so by some of our Allies. This criticism came from people who
                            did not know the facts. As a result of what we did, the situation had
                            been calm for two or three years, and Quemoy and Matsu were still being
                            held. If, before we had acted in that situation, we had had to consult
                            for a week or two, the whole area might have been lost.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that as he had stated previously, there was no aspect
                            of our policy which we were not prepared to discuss and to be questioned
                            on. However, when we had to act pursuant to these policies, we would
                            have to have the confidence of our Allies that we would not act
                            recklessly. We might act boldly, but we would not act recklessly.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he agreed that it would be desirable to increase the
                            authority and stature of our representatives in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. This was somewhat harder for us than for the Germans,
                            since it was difficult for the American representatives to return to
                            Washington to attend meetings of the Cabinet and of the National
                            Security Council. He thought it was also sound to enlarge the powers of
                            the Secretary General. He did not think we would have to do much on this
                            subject. M. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>, who was a
                            dynamic personality, would do it himself.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said there was one suggestion on which he would welcome
                            Herr <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName>’s views. It
                            might be helpful if the Ambassadors of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> countries could meet with the Foreign Minister in a
                            particular capital for consultation if a specific occasion for doing so
                            arose. He said that if the need arose he would be prepared to meet with
                            the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ambassadors. No matter how
                            capable the permanent representatives were and in our case we had
                            capable representatives, there was no substitute in some circumstances
                            for getting information first-hand, since everything could not be
                            conveyed by cable. He thought that this procedure might be particularly
                            applicable in Washington, London, Bonn, and Paris. In Paris, of course,
                                <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0230"/>the French Foreign Minister
                            could meet with the permanent representatives in the Council.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary said he was a little at a loss as to what to say on
                            military matters. He would ask Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1"
                                >Smith</persName> to speak on the question of basic and applied
                            research, since he was somewhat better posted on this subject. He did
                            not wish to comment on matters of military organization in the absence
                            of representatives of the Department of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Nuclear Weapons</hi></p>
                        <p>As to nuclear weapons, the Secretary said it seemed to us that it would
                            be a very wasteful use of our combined assets if at this stage one
                            country after another were to undertake the long and expensive process
                            of trying to make such weapons.…</p>
                        <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>Making these weapons is, of course, a very costly process. United States
                            production was increasing both the quality and quantity. We were getting
                            them clean and making them smaller. We were doing this at enormous cost
                            and it would be folly for all the countries of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> to attempt to do this.…</p>

                        <p>With regard to the procedure at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            meeting, the Secretary said that the question of acting on the Annual
                            Review prior to the meeting would be discussed again on the following
                            Tuesday. He hoped that it would be decided to dispose of the Annual
                            Review before the Heads of Government meeting. He thought that Herr
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName>’s suggestion
                            regarding <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">General Norstad</persName> was a
                            good idea. He believed that this sort of thing had been done before and
                            thought we would go along with whatever the majority wanted. As to the
                            declaration, it was important that work should be done in advance. The
                            declaration could not be written in the last few hours of the meeting as
                            is usually done with a communiqué. He thought that M. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> was perhaps preparing a draft for
                            discussion by the permanent representatives. If it were to be done by
                            one person, M. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> was probably
                            the best choice. The Secretary said he hoped he could get to Paris a day
                            or two before the meeting, perhaps on the previous Sunday. It might be
                            useful if some of the Ministers were in Paris before the meeting and
                            could work with <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>.</p>

                                    >NATO</gloss></hi></p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> to
                            discuss scientific cooperation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1"
                                >Smith</persName> said that as he understood it, Herr <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName> had referred to three
                            principal areas: (1) basic research; (2) applied research; and (3)
                            design of long-range missiles. He thought that these presented different
                            degrees of difficulty. As to basic research, we were studying the report
                            of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Task Force. We were in
                            general agreement with it and thought we could be quite forthcoming at
                            the Paris meeting. The field of applied research involves problems of
                            greater difficulty, but they were ones which we believed were
                            manageable. He thought we would have proposals to make in this area. The
                            third area presented even greater difficulties, although we felt that
                            good results were well within the order of possibility. It would be
                            quite ridiculous if we did not tap European and particularly German
                            talent, in view of the role Germany had played in the missile field. On
                            the other hand, there were other problems involving proprietary rights,
                            for example. One should not expect too rapid progress. He said that the
                            United States would approach this matter sympathetically at the
                            meeting.</p>
                        <p>In addition, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> said that
                            reference had been made to a joint venture with the French and Italians.
                            As to this point, he could only echo what the Secretary had said. He did
                            not think that this would be an economical use of resources. He
                            suggested that agreements under Section 144(b) of the Atomic Energy Act
                            might be a more practical approach. He pointed out the problem of
                            designing warheads for ballistic missiles was extraordinarily complex.
                            It had taken the United States ten years to develop a warhead for the
                            intermediate range missile. The Secretary asked how much money it had
                            cost us, remarking that it was probably between ten and twenty billion
                            dollars. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> said that we
                            would have to take our entire investment into account. He thought that
                            the cost could reasonably be estimated at $12 billion.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary said that Herr <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von
                                Brentano</persName> had spoken of the Annual Review. He had been
                            frank enough to recognize that the Federal Republic had been delinquent
                            to some extent in connection with its own build-up. He hoped that some
                            reassurance could be given to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            meeting on this point. This was something which was always being thrown
                            at <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and at us, because we were to
                            some extent partners of the Federal Republic. He hoped that something
                            could be said on this subject by the Chancellor. A good <pb n="204"
                                xml:id="pg_204" facs="0232"/>many countries, including the United
                            States, would want to hear what the Federal Republic was proposing to
                            do.</p>
                        <p>Herr <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName> said that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">General Norstad</persName> was satisfied
                            with and agreed with the plans for the build-up of the German forces.
                            However, the new German Minister of Finance had drawn a very serious
                            picture of the German financial situation when the matter had come up.
                            Herr <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName> suggested that
                            Herr Etzel should come to the United States and talk with the Secretary
                            and with the Secretary of the Treasury on the subject. When the German
                            build-up had been discussed in the Defense Council, it had been
                            estimated that the cost for 1958 would be <gloss target="#t_DM1"
                                >DM</gloss> 14 billion, for 1959 <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss>
                            17 billion, and for 1960 <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 21 billion.
                            This was to be compared with an existing budget level of <gloss
                                target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 9 billion. It was not clear how these
                            sums could be raised. They would have to be raised in part by increasing
                            taxes. This might cause difficulties with Parliament, but the Federal
                            Government was resolved to push forward with the build-up, not only
                            because of its Treaty obligations but because it felt there was an
                            urgent need for doing so.</p>
                        <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Relations between Regional Security
                            Organizations</hi></p>
                        <p>The Secretary said one suggestion we were thinking of was some way of
                            interlocking the various regional security organizations. This could
                            perhaps be done by having observers from the various organizations
                            attend meetings of the other organizations. This would have both
                            advantages and disadvantages. The fact of the matter was that the world
                            is becoming interlocked. While it is possible to have local wars, there
                            is a danger that a local war would give rise to a general war. The idea
                            of observers had been suggested by one of the organizations. We had
                            reached no conclusion about it and had mentioned it to no one else. In
                            fact, it had not yet been carefully considered in our own Government.
                            The Secretary said he did not know whether it was wise or not, but he
                            thought it was worth considering.</p>
                        <p>Herr <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName> said that this
                            was a new proposal on which he was not prepared to comment. In general,
                            he thought it was useful to have contacts between the organization and
                            to exchange information. Some of the areas involved overlap. He thought
                            the idea of observers was perhaps a good one.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles</hi></p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he should perhaps say something about the question of
                            supplying <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>s to other <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries. As he had said in his
                            conversation with Herr <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von
                                Brentano</persName> at his home, long-range <pb n="205"
                                xml:id="pg_205" facs="0233"/>bombers will be the most effective
                            means of delivery until 1960. The United States has marked superiority
                            over the Soviets in this field. Our missile program will be making good
                            progress in 1960. We could accelerate it somewhat. If this were done, it
                            would be more for psychological than for military reasons. By extreme
                            effort, we could accelerate it to a point where the missiles would be in
                            production in a little over a year. This would be extremely costly,
                            however, and whether it would be worthwhile to spend the necessary money
                            to accelerate to that degree had not yet been decided.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that these missiles involve two aspects. One is the
                            production of the missile itself and the other is the creation of an
                            ability to use it, which involves both establishing necessary
                            installations and training people in its use. The second matter is
                            extremely expensive in itself.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he thought we should be in a position to supply <gloss
                                target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>s to <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. We already have arrangements with the United Kingdom,
                            which were made at Bermuda. We could make arrangements with other
                            countries if <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> thought it
                            desirable and if the country wanted it. Both of these conditions were
                            essential. As he had said, the preparations for receiving and being able
                            to use an <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> were complicated and
                            expensive, running into the tens of millions of dollars. It is a process
                            which takes about a year from the time at which sites are selected. In
                            the case of the United Kingdom, the period of preparation had not been
                            completed. In response to a question from the Secretary, General
                                <persName>Guthrie</persName> said that while no date had been set in
                            the United Kingdom, the preparations might be completed however by the
                            end by 1958.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said there were therefore four problems: (1) the military
                            question of where to place such missiles; (2) the question of political
                            willingness to receive them; (3) the question of financing the heavy
                            costs involved; (4) the preparation of the actual site for the missile
                            and the training of personnel. The Secretary said that a decision on the
                            model to be selected had not been reached. While there had been a
                            tendency to put the decision off, the missile would be ready by the date
                            when the balance shifts.</p>
                        <p>As far as <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was concerned, the
                            Secretary said he did not think there should be an elaborate discussion
                            of this subject. The United States could perhaps indicate its
                            willingness to supply these weapons and draw attention to the problems
                            involved in receiving them.</p>
                        <p>Herr <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName> said he was not
                            an expert on this subject, but he knew that great doubt had been
                            expressed as to the desirability of establishing fixed sites for such
                            weapons in Germany. He pointed out that the warning time in Germany is
                            only six minutes. It might be preferable to have mobile launching
                            points. Herr <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName>
                            <pb n="206" xml:id="pg_206" facs="0234"/>said that this matter had
                            already been discussed with <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">General
                                Norstad</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that it was a very complicated problem. Some people
                            think that sites should be in mountainous terrain while others think it
                            should be in flat country. He said he wished to mention the subject in
                            view of the fact that there had been a great deal of discussion about
                            it. He also wished to emphasize the problems involved in receiving these
                            weapons.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Information to the Press</hi></p>
                        <p>It was agreed that the press would be informed that an exchange of views
                            had taken place on the forthcoming <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            meeting and that the discussion would probably be continued after dinner
                            and perhaps on the following morning.<note n="5" xml:id="d64fn5">See the

                            to have another opportunity to talk with the Secretary. He said that he
                            and <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Blankenhorn</persName> would report to
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> on the matters
                            discussed here and he was sure that they could clarify certain questions
                            which had been uppermost in the Chancellor’s mind.</p>
                        <p>He said that there were three matters particularly which he would like to
                            refer to again. The first concerned political consultation <pb n="207"
                                xml:id="pg_207" facs="0235"/>in the North Atlantic Council.
                            Unfortunately, the report of the Three Wise Men did not produce results
                            commensurate with our expectations. The second matter concerned the
                            proposal made by M. <persName corresp="#p_PCP1">Pineau</persName>, with
                            which <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brentano</persName> agreed, to
                            establish a European research community. He hoped that the United States
                            would be willing to assist and support such a project and exchange
                            experiences with the Europeans. He had noticed, during yesterday’s
                            conversations, a reference to cooperation on a bilateral basis under the
                            terms of a “144 b Agreement”. He did not know what this meant. The third
                            matter which he wished to discuss concerned military questions.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brentano</persName> emphasized he was
                            merely inquiring concerning our views on the forthcoming <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Meeting and was not pressing us to
                            make decisions on these matters.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he had very little to add to what he had already said
                            on the subject of consultation. He referred to the fact that the
                            consultation in the North Atlantic Council had improved treaty over the
                            past year and we had made a great effort to keep our Permanent
                            Representative adequately informed. He felt that in some cases it might
                            be preferable to discuss certain matters with our <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies here in Washington in the
                            interest of speed and accuracy. He referred to the fact that some
                            nations do not want all problems discussed in the North Atlantic Council
                            and, perhaps, it was better not to do so. He referred particularly to
                            Cyprus in this connection and also to important developments in North
                            Africa which the French apparently did not wish to discuss. When quick
                            decisions are necessary, it would be impracticable to discuss them in
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. All of these matters must be
                            governed by the rule of reason.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Blankenhorn</persName>, saying that he would
                            like to express Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                                >Adenauer</persName>’s views, said that the Chancellor feels that
                            there has been too little consultation on important actions which might
                            involve the whole alliance. He spoke specifically of the Syrian crisis
                            and the matter of the arms lift to Jordan. He felt certain moves of this
                            nature could easily provoke a large crisis which would involve Germany.
                            The Secretary interrupted to say that while we recognize the interest of
                            our allies in such matters, we frequently must act quickly in order to
                            be effective. This was so in the case of Jordan; if we had not delivered
                            arms within a few hours, King <persName corresp="#p_Hussein1"
                                >Hussein</persName> might have been deposed. We had moved the Sixth
                            Fleet to the Eastern Mediterranean for the same purpose and had
                            approached Israel to request that it cooperate in desisting from any
                            intervention or border raids against Jordan. These decisions had been
                            taken in a matter of a very few hours and we could not have saved the
                            situation if we had no possibility of quick action. If we were not in
                            position to act quickly, a situation might easily develop which could
                            involve all our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners in war.
                            Those partners should be thankful, therefore, that <pb n="208"
                                xml:id="pg_208" facs="0236"/>we saved the situation in this case.
                            Instead, all we get is criticism. The <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> allies, he said, would be doomed if the United States
                            were not in a position to act quickly and decisively.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Blankenhorn</persName> tried to explain that
                            Germany did not intend in any way to tie the hands of the United States
                            in such matters and that the Chancellor’s suggestion was directed mainly
                            at the question of informing the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            allies of the reasons for our actions. This would not require prior
                            consultation, but could be done subsequently. He felt that this was
                            necessary in order that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            partners could be in a position to support the United States. For
                            example, Turkey was involved in the Syrian situation and if a crisis had
                            developed, Germany would have been involved as a <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partner. Therefore, the German
                            Government would like to be better informed regarding our motives and
                            our actions.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we probably can do more to keep our allies informed
                            and we are prepared to do so in an effort to make the alliance a more
                            effective instrument. In some cases, however, even officers of the
                            United States Government are not brought into the picture, for various
                            reasons. In such cases, it would be unrealistic to expect us to do more
                            for our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHA1">Blankenhorn</persName> said the United States is
                            the great leader of the North Atlantic Alliance and that it is important
                            that the representative of the United States in the North Atlantic
                            Council be able to present the views and policies of his Government. The
                            Secretary said we must apply the rule of reason in such matters. He said
                            that an alliance, to be effective, must be a blend of three elements:
                            consultation, trust, and capacity for action. No one of these three
                            elements should be present in excess. The Secretary described the very
                            great amount of consultation which must take place within the United
                            States Government itself before any action can be agreed. To add to this
                            load of consultation could be counter-productive. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHA1">Blankenhorn</persName> said if the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies are to have confidence in the
                            United States they must be informed of U.S. policy. The Secretary said
                            that was a serious statement and repeated that there are some cases
                            where our allies must trust the United States. If our partners distrust
                            our motives, that in itself should be discussed in the North Atlantic
                            Council. In many cases, the Secretary said, there may be real security
                            reasons for taking unusual precautions to avoid possible leaks. <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> must give some leeway to those having
                            the principal responsibility of meeting the threat.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            is an unpredictable and impetuous individual and we can expect constant
                            probing by the Soviets in various quarters. These probings must be met
                            by complete determination by the North Atlantic Alliance. If the Soviets
                            should receive the impression that the United States is hesitant to
                            respond to these probings, they would multiply around the world.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Blankenhorn</persName>
                            <pb n="209" xml:id="pg_209" facs="0237"/>said that inadequate
                            consultation sometimes gives rise to misunderstandings. He understood
                            why there might be obstacles to such consultation in certain cases, but
                            he felt that some information was necessary even though it might not be
                            given in detail.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that other governments could do more in this field
                            also and he cited the recent Netherlands–Australia declaration regarding
                            New Guinea, and United Kingdom actions with respect to the Arabian
                            Peninsula. <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Blankenhorn</persName> said these
                            matters are not of the same importance as those involving the United
                            States. The Secretary disagreed, saying that actions in the Arabian
                            Peninsula affect King <persName corresp="#p_SIAAFS1">Saud</persName>,
                            who is the key to the Middle Eastern situation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he was not qualified to talk about technical matters
                            such as this question of basic research exchanges and he thought this
                            matter should be taken up through diplomatic channels.</p>
                        <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>The Secretary concluded by saying that we would have suggestions to make
                            at the December meeting regarding an atomic stockpile for <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Before we can finalize such
                            suggestions, however, we must await the views of the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff.</p>

                                <item>We shall sympathetically consider the interesting suggestion
                                    that the Heads of Government with the initiative of the

                                    military alliance and now constitutes an expression of Atlantic
                                    political community and as much should be considered to have an

                                <item><p>We agree to the principle of mutual consultation through
                                        the Permanent Council, and perhaps otherwise, and have
                                        sought to develop this particularly during the past year. Of
                                        course as I explained at our recent <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                            >NATO</gloss> meetings and also now to Dr. <persName
                                            corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName>, we must not
                                        create an obligation of consultation so rigid that it
                                        precludes the possibility of a quick reply to Soviet
                                        initiatives. If there should be a probing operation either
                                        in Europe, the Middle East or Asia, e.g., Berlin, the only
                                        response that is effective is one that is almost
                                        instantaneous. A probing operation which is allowed to
                                        gather headway quickly becomes more than a probe, it becomes
                                        an attack, and that evolution we must be prepared to
                                        prevent. If our general policies are understood and agreed
                                        upon in advance, there must be sufficient trust and
                                        confidence to permit quick applications; otherwise we shall
                                        be totally incapable of matching the thrusts of a versatile
                                        operator like Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"

                                    Paris should be given more than a military character. It should,
                                    I think, be made clear that <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                        >NATO</gloss> is a military organization only because Soviet
                                    aggressive policies make this necessary to secure the
                                    independence and integrity of the area. However, we stand by the
                                    London proposals on disarmament and want nothing more than a
                                    peace which will relieve us from the burdens of armament and the
                                    Sino-Soviet threats which have been constant over the past
                                    decade and more. We should perhaps urge that the Soviet Union
                                    show its respect for agreements by carrying out the Summit
                                    agreement with respect to the reunification of Germany. The
                                    record of the Soviet Union in breaking agreements is such that
                                    only if confidence in agreements is established by Soviet deeds
                                    can peaceful coexistence of the Soviet orbit and the free world
                                    be made a dependable and organized state of affairs.</item>

                        <p>At that meeting we discussed further the problem of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> “consultations”.</p>
                        <p>I made a point which no doubt will be reported to you, but which is so
                            important that I want to speak to it myself.</p>
                        <p>Under present conditions, and with a man of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s temperament at the head of affairs in
                            Russia, there is a great likelihood of Communist “probing” operations in
                            Europe (e.g. Berlin), the Middle East, and the Far East. These probing
                            operations will be designed primarily to test United States will, and to
                            see whether recent Soviet developments such as sputniks and the
                            potential intercontinental missile have now made the United States less
                            willing to defend wherever our allies may be threatened.</p>
                        <p>It is of the nature of a probing operation that in the first instance it
                            is exploratory, involving no committal of prestige. If it encounters a
                            quick, strong response, then the probe ceases.</p>
                        <p>If, however, there is no such quick response, the inference is that the
                            opposition is indecisive. The probe then grows into an operation of a
                            different character. The prestige of the prober becomes committed, and
                            what would otherwise be a minor incident becomes grave.</p>
                        <p>Since it is a fact that the determination and will of the United States
                            has not wavered in the slightest, it is of the utmost importance that we
                            be in a position to make this evident to the Soviet or Chinese probers.
                            Delay, and an appearance of indecision, could have serious consequences
                            and increase the likelihood of a major conflict.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out during our talks on Saturday and Sunday that the United
                            States is prepared to explain and discuss its general policy, as
                            indicated above, at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council.
                            And we are quite willing always to explain why we did what we have done.
                            But I do not think it is in the common interest to adopt a formula so
                            rigid that it would disenable us from reacting quickly to a probe. That
                            might be the case if we were committed to submit any proposed reaction
                            to prior consultation in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            Council. And I might add if such consultations were deemed by us to be
                            consistent with the general welfare, other demands would arise. The
                            result would be a false appearance of weakness and indecision which
                            would encourage Communist boldness to a point which would really involve
                            the risk of major war.</p>
                        <p>I said to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName> that our
                            nations are in effect like a doctor prescribing a capsule for a patient.
                            There are three necessary ingredients: consultation, capacity for quick
                            action, and trust. The patient will die if we prescribe a capsule which
                            has no content other than consultation and which excludes a capacity of
                            quick action with a willingness to trust each other to some reasonable
                            extent.</p>
                        <p>I can assure you that I do not think that such trust will be misplaced or
                            that there will ever be any reckless action. There are <pb n="213"
                                xml:id="pg_213" facs="0241"/>always risks, but the greatest risk of
                            all would be not to be able to react quickly to Sino-Soviet probing.</p>
                        <p>I know that consistently with this there can be a very large measure of
                            useful consultation and follow-up information, and the United States is
                            prepared to go to the limit in this respect.</p>
                        <p>We have been much disturbed over the last few days by the President’s
                            illness. Happily, he is making such an almost miraculous recovery that
                            it is now not wholly excluded that he should come to the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting. However, this should not be
                            counted upon.</p>
                        <p>I was sorry to hear you were laid up with a cold. I hope it is nothing
                            that will trouble you for long.</p>
                        <p>With every best wish, I am</p>

                            discussions with you.</p>
                        <p>Your statement that the firm position of the United States remains
                            unchanged has been a great satisfaction to me. I agree fully that in the
                            eventualities which you have in mind, the United States must react
                            immediately and decisively. It is clear to all members of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> that the United States cannot remain
                            passive before Soviet encroachment until counter-measures have been
                            discussed within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>I did not have such cases in mind in my approach. My concern was directed
                            to long-term dangerous developments, as, for example, in the Near East,
                            which the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members should meet
                            together after thorough consultation.</p>
                        <p>I am glad what I shall be able to discuss these questions with you
                            personally in Paris where I shall arrive on December 14. However, <pb

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> began by pointing
                            out that the forthcoming <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting
                            was being given what he called “a special character”.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d69fn2"><persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had
                                briefed a bipartisan Congressional meeting at the White House on
                                December 3 about the proposals the United States would submit to

                            <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0243"/>The meeting would be attended
                            by the heads of government of fifteen countries. Moreover, this <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting would be taking decisions of
                            greater importance than usual. The decisions in question would be both
                            of a specific and of a general character. The first specific, continued
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, would relate to
                            the acceptance by the United States of the plan for a <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> atomic stockpile, which had been
                            initially put forward by the French at Bonn last May.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d69fn3">See <ref target="#d56">Document 56</ref>.</note>
                            This proposal had now been formulated in terms acceptable to the U.S.
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff. The nuclear weapons with warheads would be
                            located at points on the Continent to be selected with the advice of
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">General Norstad</persName>.…</p>
                        <p>Secondly, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>,
                            the United States will set forth the content of its accelerated missiles
                            program. We will not fix any specific date, but will state that our
                                <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>s will be ready to be deployed
                            in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area whenever the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nations are ready to receive them. As
                            to the precise areas where the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>s
                            will be deployed, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> indicated that there were differences of opinion,
                            both military and political. It would presumably take some time to iron
                            out these differences.…</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> commented, in
                            response to a question from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName>, that the latter’s summary had been accurate. He
                            added that the Joint Chiefs of Staff had made some preliminary selection
                            in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area of sites for launching
                                <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>s but that <gloss
                                target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> had not yet acted officially on
                            this selection.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then pointed out
                            that there was a good deal of discussion being generated by the
                            opposition parties in the various <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            governments with respect to the question of where to deploy these
                            missiles. Indeed, there was a real danger that this could become a
                            serious political issue.…</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, we
                            would announce at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting that
                            our Atomic Energy Act would be amended in order to permit more liberal
                            exchange of atomic energy information. We will certainly seek authority
                            to exchange information with our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            allies if it is of a character that we know the Soviets already have. In
                            cases where such information is not of very great significance, we will
                            seek to exchange information with our allies even if we are not sure
                            whether the Russians possess such information or not.</p>
                        <p>Next we shall submit a project for the pooling of scientific knowledge
                            with our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies on nuclear energy
                            matters, on missiles, on outer space developments, and the like.…</p>
                        <pb n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0244"/>
                        <p>From a political point of view, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> stated that one of the most difficult issues
                            which would confront the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting
                            was the degree of consultation which should be sought in the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council. It was harder for the United
                            States than for other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nations to
                            agree to full consultation on all policy matters, because of the
                            world-wide commitments and interests of the United States. However, we
                            will agree to increase the exchange of policy information in the future
                            around the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council table. After
                            all, as far as the United States is concerned, we have no policies which
                            we seek to hide or are ashamed to acknowledge. All our policies are
                            designed to protect freedom in the world. Nevertheless, we do not want
                            to be in a position where we are unable to act promptly if necessary for
                            the reason that we are obliged to consult with the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council before taking action. With a
                            volatile and unpredictable individual like <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> at the head of the Soviet Union, we must be
                            able to act quickly in various parts of the world. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will certainly try to test
                            out the resolution of the United States in a variety of circumstances
                            and places. We must be in a position to act almost instantaneously when
                            confronted by one of these Soviet attempts to probe our resolution and
                            will. If we do not react instantly to such a probe, the prestige of the
                            Soviet Union would become committed, with much more serious results.
                            Furthermore, there were some problems between members of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> where it was plainly better to deal
                            outside the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council than within
                            it. This was true of the Cyprus problem. Likewise, France does not want
                            the Algerian question discussed in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> Council. Exceptions such as these seem to preclude a
                            hard and fast rule that all such policy matters must be discussed in the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council before a <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nation acts. But in general, we would
                            do more by way of consultation, we will increase the stature of our
                            permanent representatives in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Thereafter, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            indicated that there would be discussions at the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting in the economic field. The
                            Italians, the Germans, and the French are all particularly anxious for
                            such discussions. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is no exception
                            to the other international bodies, in that its members all desire to
                            have a voice in determining how the United States spends its money
                            overseas. We are trying to work out a compromise measure which will
                            provide for some kind of international fund, but not such a fund for
                            which the United States alone subscribes all the money.</p>
                        <p>There will also be discussion of <persName corresp="#p_PG1"
                                >Pella</persName>’s suggestion for a <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> fund to provide assistance to the underdeveloped areas
                            of the Middle <pb n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0245"/>East. There are
                            certain features in <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pella</persName>’s
                            proposal which we do not like,<note n="4" xml:id="d69fn4">Reference is
                                to the “<persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pella</persName> Plan” for Middle
                                East economic development.</note> notably repayment in local
                            currencies; but we may agree on some plan which would provide that help
                            to underdeveloped countries should be undertaken through a multilateral
                            approach. We may even want to set up a new mechanism for this purpose,
                            although there are a lot of multilateral mechanisms already in existence
                            which can serve the purpose.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, there would undoubtedly be a discussion of disarmament. In this
                            field the United States proposed to re-affirm the proposals which it
                            made last May, coupling this with an indication of some measure of
                            greater flexibility.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> concluded by
                            stressing that the main importance of the meeting would arise from the
                            presence at it of President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName>. This should in itself provide a rejuvenation
                            of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, which clearly needed it in
                            many instances, notably in case of France, which was a very weak partner
                            indeed in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> alliance and caused
                            us all a great deal of anxiety. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> thought that the <persName corresp="#p_GF1"

                            confront the French with a Hobson’s choice between a Gaullist regime on

                        <p>Apropos of these remarks, the President said that one was almost
                            compelled to take a strong attitude toward France. Changing his thought,
                            the President wondered whether, at the open meeting at 12 noon on
                            Monday, we should not emphasize a peace move and a disarmament move as a
                            means of indicating our peaceful intentions.</p>

                        <p>The Prime Minister opened by asking if the Secretary would like to

                            expectations in the public press and and the large-scale Soviet
                            propaganda campaign has resulted in the likelihood that the European
                            nations will inject important political matters for discussion. The form
                            of the meeting has changed; we must face these problems and now and not
                            put them off. He expressed the hope that the U.S. and <gloss

                            wise. These strategic decisions perhaps could be turned to advantage.
                            For example, he expects that the military will not want to deploy
                            ballistic missiles east of the Rhine, and the Germans are apparently
                            reluctant to have missiles stationed in the German Federal Republic. We
                            might consider accepting the Eastern German Zone—with inspection to
                            verify compliance. If there is no military requirement, this would not
                            cost anything and might have substantial political advantage.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister stated that he felt the conference will have to get

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> agreed that the

                                <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName>. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that it might be
                            undesirable for the President to lead off in the restricted session
                            after having spoken just before at the open session. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn</persName> mentioned that the <gloss

                            the presentation. Doubt was expressed that the formal statements would
                            be concluded by Monday night. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn
                                Lloyd</persName> said that any speeches before President <persName

                            would be of little interest because all would be waiting to hear what
                            the President said. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn
                                Lloyd</persName> added that he thought that all the representatives
                            in the North Atlantic Council thought that the President would open up
                            the restricted session. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>
                            will wind up each session giving the line which he proposes to follow in
                            his press conference each evening. There was some discussion about the
                            nature of the Tuesday morning session. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that the President
                            might visit <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss> Tuesday morning and
                            that perhaps his presence at the Tuesday morning <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting would not be necessary.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> expressed doubt
                            that the conference could finish its work Wednesday night. If that is to
                            be the case, should not one say so at the start to avoid the appearance
                            of any hitch. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            agreed that if there was to be a delay in finishing up, we should
                            announce it as early as possible. He pointed out that some countries
                            probably would not take their full fifteen minutes for formal
                            statements. He suggested that the matter of spilling over to Thursday
                            wait until we see how the Monday session goes. The Prime Minister said
                            the speed of the conference depended entirely on whether there was
                            discussion of substance or just general talk. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> pointed out the new

                            brought into the situation and wondered how we could assume the
                            offensive. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            pointed out that it might be well to establish a group to make
                            recommendations about letters <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            might send to Soviet Union suggesting changes in their policy. He
                            expressed the opinion that the Soviet note writing was excellent
                            craftsmanship and their timing very good. He pointed out that they are
                            capitalizing on the relatively novel technique of public letters between
                            Heads of Government.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> suggested that we
                            might take the political offensive by some statements in the communiqué.
                            For example we might agree that the foreign ministers should meet to
                            discuss disarmament. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> suggested that Hungary might be a good subject to
                                <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0255"/>discuss. He felt, however,
                            that this proposal could not be settled at the present <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that we had a long struggle against very clever
                            barbarians. He was worried about signs of change in thinking from
                            “unexpected” people. He felt the need of a constructive counterattack,
                            and reverted to the idea of not to place long-range missiles in Germany.
                            He thought of a similar move in the disarmament field; suggest that we
                            might propose to the Russians further disarmament negotiations, pointing
                            out that fifty-four nations had endorsed the London disarmament

                            that his would call their bluff.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then spoke about the matter of consultation, pointing out
                            that the consultative process often results in actions being cleared too
                            late to do any good. It is hard to expose one’s plans to fifteen
                            countries debating in the North Atlantic Council. A number of the
                            countries don’t know very much about the problems on which we are asked
                            to consult. He expressed doubt that agreement could be reached in the
                            North Atlantic Council on an answer to the <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                                >Bulganin</persName> notes. The Prime Minister agreed but wondered
                            if it would not be possible to get some consensus on principles.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out the
                            difficulty of a coalition in competition with a single power. He added
                            that there should be more trust by the coalition in the leadership of a
                            few countries. He referred to his talk in Washington with <persName

                            had replied that in the coming months he was sure the Communists would
                            engage in a number of probing operations “now that we are all under the
                            guns so to speak.” It is essential that we be free to react instantly.
                            If I don’t, the situation could get out of control the probers’ prestige
                            might get committed and the operation might not be stopped short of war.
                            He felt that <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Blankenhorn</persName> was more

                            some extent. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            cited the example of a recent insulting note which we had received from

                            immediately to turn the note back to the USSR, but at <gloss

                            Atlantic Council at such length and so much time passed that the
                            rejection of the note did not seem feasible. The Prime Minister agreed
                            that the important thing was to get agreements on principles allowing
                            for fast action in individual cases. The Secretary said we must be
                            careful not to treat Germany different from the rest of the allies. For
                            instance, it may be sensible to agree not to place missiles within a
                            certain number of miles of Germany’s eastern border but the geography
                            should not be described as involving the German Federal Republic and the
                            Soviet Zone of Germany. He pointed out that the <persName
                                corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> note had urged agreement

                            Minister agreed saying that the thing to do was to get agreement on a
                            purely military basis. The Secretary referred to the problem of zones
                            which resulted from the Geneva meeting of 1955 and the muddle that had
                            resulted.</p>

                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that on the question <pb

                            he felt that we should use the principle that an attack on one nation
                            would be an attack on all members of the coalition.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> referred to the
                            revival of the Combined Policy Committee and it was agreed that this
                            would be good mechanism to supervise the new technological cooperation
                            established during the Prime Minister’s visit to Washington last month.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out,
                            however, that this did not mean that any past decisions of the CPC would
                            have binding or precedential effect for the future.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked about the possibility of “regularizing” the

                            about U.S. use of <gloss target="#t_UKG1">U.K.</gloss> bases for U.S.

                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> asked if he had
                            in mind doing this now, and the Prime Minister said “no.” The Prime
                            Minister said it would be useful if we could develop a formula so that

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he was to

                            said that the support cost question was a matter of some urgency with
                            the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">U.K.</gloss> in that their budget estimates
                            had to be firmed up by mid-January. The Prime Minister then stated that
                            Germany with its great wealth should go in more for foreign investment.
                            It had accumulated one thousand million dollars a year and immobilized
                            this vast sum. He was fearful that this process would lead to a
                            world-wide depression. A paramount imperative of capitalism is to put
                            such reserves to use around the world. If they do not this, Germany will
                            be ruined in the end. It is the Marxist argument that capitalism will
                            not find productive use for its reserves and thus destroy itself.
                            Marxism has been refuted by the examples of the <gloss target="#t_UKG1"
                                >U.K.</gloss> and the U.S. which had put its accumulated reserves to

                            understand this.</p>

                            situation facing the Conference on the political front. He mentioned
                            that the French and German Delegations had so far seemed to hold back,
                            and he did not have a very good idea of what they might bring up. For
                            example, he thought that it was possible that the French might raise the
                            Algerian question. He guessed that the Greeks would not raise Cyprus,
                            and he was pretty sure that the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> and

                        <p>Moving to the military problems, <persName corresp="#p_SPH1"
                                >Spaak</persName> emphasized the political concerns of the French
                            Government with respect both to the storage of atomic warheads and to
                                <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>s.</p>
                        <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>As to the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>s, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> referred to the French desire for
                            equality with other nations.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName> stated that, if
                            the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> stockpile plan and the <gloss
                                target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>s were accepted for <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> as a whole, there would have to be
                            individual bilateral arrangements worked out between the US and each
                            country concerned.…</p>
                        <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0259"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName> pointed out
                            that the production of the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>s in the
                            US was coming along quite satisfactorily, and he believed that
                            additional squadrons accepted by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            and Continental countries would probably be available for delivery just
                            about as fast as the countries concerned could complete their advance
                            arrangements for sites and training.</p>
                        <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>Referring to science matters, he thought that the picture was still quite
                            blurred as to just what should be done in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. He felt, however, there was full agreement on the
                            desirability of having a scientific committee to sort out the details
                            and a top calibre scientific advisor. In this connection, he more or
                            less assumed that the US would provide the top scientific advisor.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName> said that, if
                            that should be the wish of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, he was
                            sure that the US could produce a highly-competent top-level man,
                            subject, of course, to the personal acceptance of <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> himself.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> referred, with an air of

                            was tempering his optimism as to final results until the end of the

                        <p>I mentioned support costs. He asked what our program was. I said that I
                            thought we would try to get as much more as we could for the current
                            year but that probably we would not press for a subsequent year although
                            this had not yet been finally decided. The Defense people wanted to
                            press primarily to make a record for Congress. I myself felt that
                            pressing would not get any money but would give the Germans an excuse to
                            keep other things unsettled and the net result would be loss and not
                            gain.</p>
                        <p>I said that in talking with the Germans I had sensed that they were quite
                            stubborn against any assumption of support costs although it seemed they
                            would be flexible as regards the foreign exchange aspect of the British
                            problem. I mentioned that the Germans had indicated that they felt that
                            under the Brussels Treaty this was the only aspect the British were
                            entitled to bring up and they were prepared to meet the British on this
                            aspect of the matter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> asked whether I had
                            discussed this alone with <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>
                            or when the others were present. I said this had come up when the others
                            were present. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said he
                            thought <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> would probably
                            make the decision. I said perhaps so but I had a feeling that <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> was tending to delegate
                            increasing responsibility and not settle everything himself as had been
                            the case earlier.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said that the fact was
                            that the Germans were not really building up their own military forces.
                            I said I thought there was considerable improvement under way in this
                            respect.</p>

                            said we still had hope for <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UN</gloss> but under

                            was alliance of equals. There was basic accord among nations though

                            for peace and need overcome division of world. He said most important
                            need was for disarmament agreement under adequate safeguard. He
                            expressed regret world differences not overcome in 1957 although West
                            made concessions. Political directions of past months showed no
                            relaxation by Soviets. They had caused crisis in Middle East. <gloss

                            political consultation and economic cooperation should be reinforced.
                            Divergencies could be eliminated by consultation on constant not

                        <p><persName>Gerhardsen</persName> wondered how meeting could meet high
                            expectations aroused. He said <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            clearly defensive in purpose. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> had
                            met Soviet threat during past nine years through its unity. On military
                            questions we could elaborate further at spring meeting. … He expressed
                            interest in proposals for military thinned out areas in Europe to reduce
                            tension. On <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> letter he
                            had no opinion yet. He thought no decision should be taken on <persName
                                corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> letter until further studied
                            by governments. He still hoped Soviets would negotiate on disarmament
                            and we should give them chance do so. There was little chance Soviets
                            starting war and their advances more in nature political and economic
                            progress in uncommitted nations. Therefore we should propose economic
                            and political measures.</p>
                        <p><persName>Gerhardsen</persName> added there should be balanced use
                            resources in order military should not take too much of whole. Though
                            sometimes political consultation not possible it should be strengthened.
                            There are some divergences but decisions should be taken in knowledge
                            views of others. He thought we should meet adversary halfway on
                            disarmament. Our August 29 proposals were still valid as basis for
                            discussion though Soviets should not think they were ultimatum.</p>
                        <p>There was reason for satisfaction with <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> performance since 1949 but now we were at crossroads
                            because of Soviet military progress. Therefore we must progress with
                            policy of peace and eliminate “balance of terror”.</p>

                            Now Soviets have caught up technically and passed US in atomic and
                            missile fields. All now in direct danger paralyzing attack. Though
                            Soviets stopped diplomatically in Europe they had made great progress in

                            French control over weapons in France was political necessity and

                        <p>After an exchange of the usual pleasantries, the President said that he

                            He added that everyone seemed agreed on the need for consultation, but
                            added that immediately thereafter they had all unilaterally released
                            their statements to the press, which contradicted what they had just
                            said. The President said this humorously, and then returning to a
                            serious vein, he said we were very much in favor of closer, fuller and
                            even earlier consultation. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZA1"
                                >Zoli</persName> then complimented the President on the two splendid
                            speeches he had made on the first day. He felt that they had struck the
                            keynote of the meeting, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PG1"
                                >Pella</persName> said that the Conference could well have ended on
                            that note—what followed was anti-climactic.</p>
                        <p>The President felt that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1"
                                >Macmillan</persName> had made a fine presentation and had made
                            useful suggestions as to the work procedure for the Conference. With
                            this, the Italian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister agreed.</p>
                        <p>The President then said that during the time he had been in Europe, the
                            Italian Government had always been in the forefront of the movement for
                            European integration. He asked whether this was still true. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZA1">Zoli</persName> replied that it was even
                            more true today than before. This was true not only of the Italian
                            Government but of broad sections of the population, particularly the
                            young people who were convinced Europeans. The President said that he
                            had always favored closer integration in Europe. If, for example, Italy,
                            France, and Germany drew closer together, they would represent a power
                            comparable to the Soviet Union and the United States, and in this case
                            there would be three great powers in the world, two of them on the side
                            of freedom and this would certainly cause the Russians to pause and
                            reflect. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pella</persName> said it was
                            important that there be no discrimination against anyone, and the
                            President emphatically said he had been citing an example, but he
                            certainly felt that the Belgians, the Dutch, and the others should
                            likewise be included. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZA1"
                                >Zoli</persName> felt that anything that could be done during the
                            Conference to give additional stimulus in this direction within the
                            framework of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would be helpful.</p>
                        <p>The President said that when he had been here before, one of Italy’s
                            great problems had been unemployment, and that there had been some 2.6
                            million unemployed, as he recollected the figure. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZA1">Zoli</persName> replied that the figures of
                            unemployment were sometimes somewhat deceptive. They now had 1.8 million
                            unemployed; 1.6 million during periods of greater employment. This
                            represented great progress, but they were not convinced that all of
                            these were really unemployed. Italy’s greatest preoccupation was the
                            raising of the low <pb n="244" xml:id="pg_244" facs="0272"/>living
                            standards which existed in southern Italy where great poverty existed.
                            The President said that, as we had said before, we were asking for an
                            increase in lending authority in certain governmental organizations, and
                            that a favorable climate would attract private investment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZA1">Zoli</persName> then said he knew that the
                            President had an appointment with Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                                >Adenauer</persName> and that he did not wish to keep him any
                            longer. He merely wished to tell him of the respect and affection which
                            the Italian people had for him and their high hope that he would come to
                            Rome at some time in the future. The President said he hoped this would
                            be possible and the two Italian Ministers then took leave of the
                            President.</p>

                        <p>3) Secretary inquired whether this meeting was restricted from standpoint
                            of publicity. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> said he
                            intended hold no press conference on this restricted session. There
                            would be a press conference at the end of Heads of Governments meeting
                            this afternoon but he would not communicate any summary of what
                            Ministers might say this morning. For clarification Secretary asked
                            whether Foreign Ministers who wished could make public substance their
                            own statements. Portugal proposed that meeting be considered as
                            absolutely private session and this was agreed. <persName

                                >Spaak</persName> inquired whether anything had changed in <gloss

                            as he expected answer was no then it remained to decide what reference
                                <pb n="245" xml:id="pg_245" facs="0273"/>was to be made to subject
                            in communiqué. Germany (<persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brentano</persName>)
                            thanked United States and United Kingdom for reference to German
                            reunification and Berlin in their statements at first plenary session.
                            Felt it important mention German reunification and Berlin in final
                            communiqué. If not mentioned absence would be remarked upon. Situation
                            in Berlin always delicate and has become more so in recent weeks. SecGen
                            asked German Delegation prepare draft language for communiqué. Secretary
                            suggested we recall summit meeting at which Soviets agreed to German
                            reunification. This not only reaffirms our desire that Germany be
                            unified in freedom but emphasizes that Western position is that we are
                            asking Soviets live up to an agreement already entered into.</p>

                                >Pineau</persName> said <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should
                            firmly state its determination to strengthen itself in military field to
                            meet Soviet threat. As parallel, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            should also emphasize desire for disarmament agreement. He suggested
                            Heads of Governments meeting take decision invite Soviets to meeting at
                            Foreign Minister level with Western Four (United States, United Kingdom,
                            France and Canada) to discuss resumption disarmament negotiations.</p>
                        <p>6) Speaking for Italy <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pella</persName> said
                            opportune in terms world opinion to stress difficulties for disarmament
                            which flowed from Soviet attitude. West forced make greater effort
                            because Soviet refusal negotiate seriously on disarmament. He suggested
                            it be proposed to Soviets United Nations Disarmament Commission be
                            convened resume disarmament discussions.</p>
                        <p>7) Norway (<persName corresp="#p_LHM1">Lange</persName>) supported French
                            proposal. Said Soviets had already taken position they don’t accept
                            present United Nations machinery for disarmament discussions. If they
                            now agreed to attend Disarmament Commission meeting, Soviets would lose
                            prestige. To show our good will we should not ask them accept loss
                            prestige. Added that if five Foreign Ministers meet, Norway hoped
                            Western representatives’ attitude would be that proposals West has
                            already put forward are good, but West willing discuss modifications,
                            without any prejudice to our interests.</p>
                        <p>8) Canada (<persName corresp="#p_SSE1">Smith</persName>) suggested that
                            in reply to <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> letters
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries should take
                            initiative and ask about Soviet attitude toward genuine disarmament
                            inspection and control.</p>
                        <p>9) United Kingdom (<persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Lloyd</persName>) hoped
                                <gloss target="#t_HG1">HG</gloss> meeting would strengthen Alliance,
                            but if no concrete results wrong impression would be created. He said
                            present <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting could not draft
                            satisfactory replies <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>
                            letters, nor was it advisable put forward idea summit meeting, which
                            should not take place without much preparation. One thing that could be
                            done was to offer Soviets meeting at Foreign <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246"
                                facs="0274"/>Minister level with Western Four. This offer would put
                            military proposals being made at present meeting in their proper
                            light.</p>
                        <p>10) Belgium (<persName corresp="#p_LV1">Larock</persName>) thought
                                <persName corresp="#p_PCP1">Pineau</persName> proposal for meeting
                            would be best possible reply to <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                                >Bulganin</persName> letters. Letters themselves should not be
                            mentioned in communiqué but <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should
                            show itself willing seek solutions to disarmament problem. <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should recall in communiqué where
                            responsibility for disarmament impasse lies. We should also reiterate
                            the correctness of the Western position on nuclear testing, control
                            provisions, etc. If Russia does not accept resume Disarmament Commission
                            discussions, increases in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military
                            strength more justified than ever.</p>
                        <p>11) Secretary said that while United States had no objection in principle
                            indicating willingness try discussions with Soviets at Foreign Minister
                            level on disarmament; however, matter would have to be handled most
                            carefully from standpoint United Nations. Enlarged Disarmament
                            Commission will be meeting in early January. We should do nothing which
                            would cut ground from under Commission. We must remember important
                            countries from other parts of the world represented on Disarmament
                            Commission and they have interest in matter. Perhaps Western Four could
                            address communication to Disarmament Commission, stating willingness
                            cooperate in seeking meeting at Foreign Minister level, but not as an
                            independent action which would undermine the Disarmament Commission
                            before it had a chance to meet.</p>
                        <p>12) Turkey (<persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName>) said Turkey
                            supported Secretary’s proposal. Stressed purpose <gloss target="#t_HG1"
                                >HG</gloss> meeting was primarily to strengthen <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military defense. No one can doubt
                            good will West has shown in United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee
                            discussions. We must show public opinion that <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>’s will to defend itself is strong. Suggested Soviets
                            be invited attend meeting of United Nations Disarmament Commission in
                            January. Said <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> must not attempt to
                            interfere with work of Commission or to take disarmament out of United
                            Nations framework.</p>
                        <p>13) Denmark (<persName corresp="#p_HHCS1">Hansen</persName>) supported
                            Norway and <persName corresp="#p_PCP1">Pineau</persName> proposal.
                            Agreed no difficulties should be made for United Nations.</p>
                        <p>14) France said meeting five Foreign Ministers could examine certain
                            disarmament questions and thus prepare way for meeting of Disarmament
                            Commission in January.</p>
                        <p>15) Italy (<persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pella</persName>) supported United
                            States proposal. Suggested first try have meeting of Disarmament
                            Commission. If this fails, we can always come back to meeting at Foreign
                            Minister level.</p>
                        <p>16) United Kingdom agreed necessary find formula to show that <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> not usurping task Disarmament
                            Commission. Said discussion with Soviets in meeting of five Foreign
                            Ministers was best formula for West. Proposal for Foreign Ministers
                            meeting would have good <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0275"/>impact
                            on public opinion. Suggested saying that we regret Soviets won’t come to
                            meeting of Disarmament Commission, but to show West’s desire get
                            disarmament discussions going again, West is suggesting meeting at
                            Foreign Ministers level.</p>
                        <p>17) Secretary said that Western Four have status in disarmament picture
                            only as members of subcommittee of a United Nations body. Since parent
                            body recently enlarged, thought it would be strange if subcommittee were
                            to go off on its own. On other hand, perhaps it was intent of <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCP1">Pineau</persName> proposal to suggest that <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should now get into disarmament
                            negotiations directly. That would be another matter and might not be
                            wise. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> cannot give a new mandate to
                            the Disarmament Subcommittee.</p>
                        <p>18) United Kingdom said it understood <persName corresp="#p_PCP1"
                                >Pineau</persName> proposal was not reinstitution of Disarmament
                            Subcommittee. Rather, Western Four would offer on behalf their own
                            countries, have a further disarmament discussion with Soviets.</p>
                        <p>19) France said United Kingdom interpretation correct. There should be no
                            allusion to United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee. In present state,
                            public opinion would not understand if special pains were not taken to
                            show West ready make new effort get disarmament discussions going.</p>
                        <p>20) Germany supported United States and said <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> should not ignore United Nations and begin
                            negotiations with Soviets on disarmament.</p>
                        <p>21) Greece (Kassimatis) agreed <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            should not compete with United Nations.</p>
                        <p>22) Portugal (<persName corresp="#p_CPAV1">Cunha</persName>) supported
                                <persName corresp="#p_PCP1">Pineau</persName> proposal. This would
                            give public opinion feeling of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            strength and reasonableness.</p>
                        <p>23) Turkey said <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should show public
                            opinion that whole negative attitude on disarmament lies with Soviets.
                            Fifty-seven United Nations countries have already sided with Western
                            disarmament proposals.</p>
                        <p>24) Netherlands supported <persName corresp="#p_PCP1">Pineau</persName>
                            proposal and said Secretary was right, in that in last analysis
                            discussions on disarmament must take place in United Nations.</p>
                        <p>25) Turkey warned against doing anything that would damage normal
                            standing of United Nations Disarmament Commission. It is not the West
                            which wants an arms race or wishes to dominate the world.</p>
                        <p>26) Norway said that situation was that at United Nations, in spite
                            Western efforts, deadlock has been reached. Western opinion expects US
                            to make some suggestion to break this deadlock.</p>
                        <p>27) Secretary said we should remember great battle at United Nations
                            recently was on issue of numbers. Soviets consistently charged that make
                            up Disarmament Subcommittee at four-to-one <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248"
                                facs="0276"/>ratio was unfair to them. Increasing membership of
                            Disarmament Commission to twenty-five went part way to meet Soviet
                            position. It would not appear a new move if we now went back to
                            four-to-one basis.</p>
                        <p>28) Canada said that she was willing to withdraw and make ratio
                            three-to-one.</p>
                        <p>29) <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> suggested that
                            international staff prepare draft text for afternoon <gloss
                                target="#t_HG1">HG</gloss> meeting containing synthesis various
                            points raised this morning and putting up the two formulas that had
                            emerged: invite Soviets to attend meeting of Disarmament Commission and
                            stand on this position, or ask Soviets attend Disarmament Commission but
                            indicate <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> prepared to try something
                            else if deadlock continues. Perhaps another combination of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries on our side could be
                            formed. Soviets might want to bring in other countries on their side. If
                            so, situation could be examined.</p>
                        <p>30) Secretary again stressed that raising membership Disarmament
                            Commission was effort meet Soviets. To go back to four-to-one would be
                            greater backdown for Soviets. Must not alienate uncommitted countries on
                            Commission. Also clear that Soviets would not negotiate with <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> except through Warsaw Pact. He for
                            one would not favor this. He also urged that meeting not forget United
                            States suggestion put forward yesterday that <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> set up a technical group on disarmament.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d77fn3">This suggestion was made by President <persName

                            This could have favorable impact. If negotiations are resumed, there

                        <p>Germany and Berlin. Draft prepared by Germany<note n="5" xml:id="d78fn5"
                                >Not found in Department of State files.</note> was modified
                            slightly and referred to drafting group.</p>
                        <p>Disarmament. Discussion again focused on question of proposing to USSR
                            special meeting on Heads of Government or Foreign Minister level, if
                            USSR unwilling work through Disarmament Commission.</p>
                        <p>Canada (<persName corresp="#p_SSE1">Smith</persName>) made strong plea
                            for such meeting, arguing that public wished to know that all
                            possibilities for disarmament had been exhausted. <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should call on USSR to work with
                            Disarmament Commission. However, if Soviets not willing, <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250"
                                facs="0278"/>say heads of state prepared meet with them, provided
                            they agree in advance on necessity for inspection system. Such proposal
                            would have tremendous effect and give West initial time.</p>
                        <p>Greece (<persName corresp="#p_ATME1">Averoff</persName>) stated present
                            meeting in sense was <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> reply to
                            Sputnik propaganda. If <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> response
                            was to plead with USSR to discuss disarmament, might give impression
                            weakness and fear.</p>
                        <p>Turkey (<persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName>) agreed with Greek
                            point. Turkey also opposed to taking disarmament out of <gloss
                                target="#t_UNO1">U.N.</gloss> forum.</p>
                        <p>Norway (<persName corresp="#p_LHM1">Lange</persName>) favored meeting on
                            Foreign Minister or Head of Government level.</p>
                        <p>France (<persName corresp="#p_PCP1">Pineau</persName>) acknowledged Greek
                            and Turkish point had validity. However, felt that if public opinion was
                            to accept greater defense effort, it was necessary to make new effort
                            towards peace. Thought it quite feasible hold top level meeting to break
                            deadlock and agree on principles, after which details could be left to
                            Disarmament Commission.</p>

                                >Macmillan</persName>) agreed with <persName corresp="#p_PCP1"
                                >Pineau</persName>. Referred to public concern in <gloss
                                target="#t_UKG1">U.K.</gloss> about U.S. and <gloss target="#t_UKG1"
                                >U.K.</gloss> planes carrying atomic bombs. This concern likely to
                            be greater with advent ballistic missiles. However, “people will take it
                            if they know we are doing something”. People being asked to accept big
                            obligations and risks and <persName corresp="#p_MH1"
                                >Macmillan</persName> felt strongly top level meeting was
                            desirable.</p>
                        <p>Italy (<persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pella</persName>) noted differences of
                            view as to whether or not proposed high level meeting would indicate
                            weakness, suggested best to defer decision until Heads of Government
                            could see what decisions they could take in military field. If latter
                            substantial, might be more willingness to accept new approach on
                            disarmament.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed accept <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pella</persName>

                            that Council request Secretary General explore possibility developing
                            relations with other organizations to facilitate exchange of information
                            and opinion, met mixed reception.<note n="6" xml:id="d78fn6">This

                        <p>France (<persName corresp="#p_PCP1">Pineau</persName>) indicated prepared
                            to agree on proposal but dubious about putting in communiqué.</p>
                        <p>Norway (<persName corresp="#p_LHM1">Lange</persName>) agreed on not
                            putting in communiqué and was opposed to direct links between
                            organizations. Thought liaison should be handled through common members
                            of various organizations. Canada and Denmark agreed with Norway.</p>
                        <p>Secretary thought device of using common members as link would suggest
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> trying to run other
                            organizations. What was <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0279"/>needed
                            was feeling on part of other organizations that they are recognized. Was
                            hard to see why <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should close its
                            eyes to information which it might obtain through links with other
                            organizations. Also not desirable rebuff desires of others.</p>
                        <p>Germany (<persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>) supported U.S.
                            proposal firmly, as did Netherlands and Italy.</p>

                                >Macmillan</persName>) said main thing was to establish
                            relationships. This was basic to concept that we engaged in conflict of
                            world-wide scope. Whether announcement should be made was secondary
                            question but, on balance, <gloss target="#t_UKG1">U.K.</gloss> also
                            favored that. Thought it would encourage free world.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> said problem was rather
                            delicate one, and there was danger in announcing approach before knowing
                            reactions other organizations. Suggested Council authorize him to take
                            soundings with other organizations in confidence and report back either
                            to Permanent Council or to next Ministerial meeting.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> suggestion was accepted but
                            Secretary pointed out was questionable whether matter could be kept

                        <p>Political consultation. France (<persName corresp="#p_PCP1"
                                >Pineau</persName>) was dissatisfied with draft prepared by
                            international staff, which French considered did not spell out with
                            sufficient precision conditions under which consultation should take
                            place. View lateness of hour discussion was not pursued.</p>

                        <p>3. Turkey (Sarper) noted references to “other countries” and
                            “less-developed areas”, and inquired whether these references were to
                            areas outside <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>14. Portugal (<persName corresp="#p_CPAV1">Cunha</persName>) thought that
                            reference to lending “every encouragement” to development European
                            economic community and European free trade area was too broad a formula,
                            seemed to pass judgement of <gloss target="#t_FTA1">FTA</gloss>, which
                            presently under discussion in <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. Italy (<persName corresp="#p_CA1">Cattani</persName>) said extremely
                            interested in <gloss target="#t_FTA1">FTA</gloss> and saw no reason not
                            to mention it in communiqué. Thought economic cooperation between <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries and other areas should be
                            stressed.</p>
                        <p>6. Greece (<persName corresp="#p_ATME1">Averoff</persName>) thought
                            paragraph on EEC and <gloss target="#t_FTA1">FTA</gloss> seemed lay too
                            much stress on raising already high economic level Western European
                            countries and not enough on furthering growth in other parts <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area.</p>
                        <p>7. Canada (<persName corresp="#p_SSE1">Smith</persName>) said he wished
                            submit redraft of same paragraph.</p>
                        <p>8. Secretary said that while US not wedded to particular language, we
                            felt important at this time to emphasize two things. First, economic
                            cooperation is desirable in order increase our own well-being and
                            strength. Second, we wished make clear our concern over situation in
                            less-developed countries, where Cold War being waged. Extremely
                            important keep up our military strength in order not be coerced by
                            Soviets. But there is real danger from Soviet and Chinese Communist
                            penetration in less-developed areas, where hopes and aspirations are
                            high. These countries already exerting themselves meet this challenge.
                            US believes there is scope for greater cooperation and coordination of
                            efforts of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries, point
                            already emphasized by Italian Delegation. Added that references to other
                            countries should be qualified by words “free world”. With respect EEC
                            and <gloss target="#t_FTA1">FTA</gloss>, these are important
                            developments. Perhaps point made by some countries could be handled by
                            making clear in paragraph in question that EEC and <gloss
                                target="#t_FTA1">FTA</gloss> not designed operate behind high
                            protective barriers, and thus dislocate trade with other free countries.
                            It is expected barriers will be lowered, and that trade and purchasing
                            power will increase.</p>
                        <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0281"/>
                        <p>9. Denmark (Krag) supported Canada and said all trade barriers should be
                            reduced, not just in Western Europe but throughout Atlantic
                            community.</p>
                        <p>10. France (<persName corresp="#p_PCP1">Pineau</persName>) remarked on
                            absence in draft of any mention of machinery to resist Soviet economic
                            penetration.</p>
                        <p>11. Secretary said paper under discussion had not attempted deal with
                            special situations, such as that referred to by <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCP1">Pineau</persName>. Such matters difficult and
                            delicate. For example, if talked about publicly, certain countries with
                            surpluses might attempt take advantage of US. Mentioned helpful work
                            already done in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> (such as Lebanese
                            apples). US considering this entire problem but no conclusion reached.
                            Secretary felt this subject best not mentioned in communiqué.</p>
                        <p>12. Greece reverted to need for mentioning development less-developed
                            areas within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>13. Italy made point that they assumed reference to <gloss
                                target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> reviewing economic trends and assessing
                            economic progress meant this would be done through existing <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> bodies, such as <gloss
                                target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_EconAd1"
                                >ECONAD</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>14. Canada suggested reference to Article 2 of treaty.</p>
                        <p>15. Secretary inquired whether SecGen wished US prepare new draft for
                            afternoon meeting. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> asked US
                            to do so.</p>

                            a subsequent disarmament discussion could be had with Soviets, but,
                            since Norway understood there was general feeling around table that
                            these weapons should be accepted now, he was introducing this amended
                            proposal. Paper in essence stated that, because Soviets have adopted
                            these weapons and have stated their readiness to use them, there is no
                            alternative but to adopt the best weapons ourselves. Council, however,
                            will have to “consider certain political and economic questions relating
                            to their use and deployment.” The military will have to report at an
                            early date on their introduction. In the meantime, he suggested that
                            disarmament talks continue.</p>
                        <p>Denmark, in supporting Norway, stated that they, too, would have

                        <p>Belgium stated there should be no delay from a military point of view in
                            taking these weapons at earliest possible date.</p>
                        <p>Secretary then expressed appreciation Norway’s position, was very happy
                            they had adopted this attitude, accepted their text in principle. During
                            subsequent discussion, it was agreed to modify wording of text by
                            changing words “consider certain political and economic questions” to

                        <p>France discussed problems of sites and conditions of use, indicating that

                        <p>Belgium and France agreed that weapon sites would be determined by

                                >SACEUR</gloss> desired. Dutch said unimportant to them where
                            missiles are located; they were not afraid to have them on theory that
                            they would attract Russian attack because any Russian attack would be a

                        <p>In opening discussion on the “balance of collective forces” Duncan Sandys
                            indicated that coordination, integration and standardization relate not
                            only to forces but also to production, research and development.</p>
                        <p>Netherlands stressed interdependence and that <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> had never decided what balanced collective forces are.
                            Integration should be a slow and progressive process.</p>
                        <p>There was then a general discussion whether or not to hold meeting of

                            prior to its becoming final military document. Nobody agreed with United
                            Kingdom. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> promised <gloss
                                target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss>–70 by February 1. It was then agreed that
                            there would be a special Foreign Ministers meeting.</p>
                        <p>Under item of defense production, United Kingdom indicated very happy
                            that United States would seek ways to purchase European-produced advance
                            weapons for its own forces. This would provide foreign exchange needed
                            to make possible purchases in the United States of weapons not
                            manufactured in Europe.</p>
                        <p>Greece put in plug for consideration by <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> of countries not having modern production
                            facilities.</p>
                        <p>France suggested some use of common financing in defense production, but
                            this not accepted.</p>
                        <p>There was no further substantive discussion of this item, and <persName

                            asked whether delegations wanted to issue a public declaration on <gloss

                            view that it essential to issue such a declaration. This was supported
                            by <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss>. Discussion then turned to

                        <p>Canada suggested addition of thought that Soviet satellites would not

                        <p>US noted that declaration lacked reference to increasing power of Soviet

                        <p>Exchange developed between Greece and Turkey (both obviously thinking of

                            “peace and freedom”. With <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName>
                            mentioning Cyprus as his major concern, he insisted that the word

                            in context para 9 the word “freedom” could not be interpreted as having
                            any reference or relevance to Cyprus situation. Squabble finally
                            resolved by adoption phrase “freedom in peace”.</p>

                            was agreed upon.</p>
                        <p>Netherlands suggested slight addition to para 15 to meet requirements of
                            Dutch public opinion concerning Indonesia. Proposal adopted without
                            debate.</p>
                        <p>On para 16, discussion developed on question of “divergencies” and
                            bringing them into harmony. President made point that <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should not always aspire to
                            “overcome” all divergencies, but should <pb n="259" xml:id="pg_259"
                                facs="0287"/>certainly always be prepared to “accommodate”
                            differences of view and subordinate them to a fundamental unity.</p>
                        <p>At this point in proceedings, <persName corresp="#p_SPH1"
                                >Spaak</persName> announced that the press had gotten hold of <gloss
                                target="#t_PC1">PC</gloss>–10. He expressed view that this
                            represents deplorable situation and made very difficult, if not
                            pointless, revision of text. He said that this always seemed to happen
                            at ministerial meetings of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>,
                            whereas leaks were very rare from sessions of Permanent Council.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHM1">Lange</persName> of Norway said that in
                            view of premature publication of draft communiqué, changes should be
                            kept to a minimum. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> said that the Council should make such changes as
                            were necessary and not attempt to make “an honest man” out of the person
                            who leaked draft communiqué.</p>
                        <p>Continuing discussion, United Kingdom suggested deletion para 34 from
                            communiqué, with understanding that Council adopt as decision substance
                            of para 34. This supported by United States, on grounds that public
                            would interpret announcement of spring meeting as deferral of action on
                            decisions taken at Heads of Government meeting. Netherlands objected to
                            deletion and proposed reference to 1957 Annual Review. Finally agreed
                            incorporate announcement spring military conference at Ministerial level
                            under para 31.</p>
                        <p>Re para 42, economic cooperation, debate developed on effect of plans for
                            Common Market and European Free Trade Area upon less developed European
                            countries, Greece and Turkey teaming up to press point that “countries
                            undergoing development should not be crushed by economic integration.”
                            In course discussion, Canada stated for record that it could not accept
                            free trade area unless food, drink and tobacco were excluded; but on
                            this understanding would not object to communiqué language.</p>
                        <p>Canada returned to para 13, stating for record that second sentence did
                            not imply military support for countries of the Middle East. Chairman
                            stated summary record would make this clear.</p>
                        <p>Final declaration and communiqué adopted.</p>
                        <p>The SecGen <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> tried to continue
                            custom of having a minister give final press conference; but was
                            prevailed upon to handle it himself. Expressions of thanks were extended
                            to the international staff and the PermReps on their work in preparing
                            this meeting. President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> suggested that, in view of the important
                            decisions taken and need for guidance in the future, there should be a
                            short period of prayer. Following silent meditation and prayer, the
                            meeting was officially adjourned.</p>

                                >Dodge</persName> in his memorandum of February 5 are that the steel

                            markets; that the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">U.K.</gloss> and the High

                        <p>Specific detailed comments on the points raised by Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> may be found at Tab C.<note n="6"

                        <p>It is apparent that various restrictive arrangements, including the steel
                            export cartel, exist among the industries of the <gloss target="#t_CSC1"
                                >CSC</gloss>, and that action by the High Authority to promote
                            competitive conditions is of vital importance to the success of the
                            Community. It was not expected, on the other hand, that the
                            establishment of the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> would quickly
                            lead to the abolition of all such arrangements in view of the complexity
                            of the problem; the long history of such arrangements in Europe; the
                            limits on the High Authority’s powers for dealing with restrictive
                            arrangements outside the Community; the pioneering character in Europe
                            of the High Authority’s efforts; and the long and careful preparation
                            required in undertaking an anti-trust action, as shown by U.S.
                            experience. Consequently, although progress is slow, to some extent this
                            is inevitable in the circumstances.</p>
                        <p>Some steps have already been taken by the High Authority against
                            restrictive arrangements and we have been assured that further measures
                            are now in preparation. We consider that there are reasonably good
                            prospects for further progress by the Community in combating such
                            arrangements.</p>

                                        target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>) have, without sanction from
                                    the High Authority, established a cartel to set minimum prices
                                    for exports from the Community. So far as is known, this
                                    agreement does not involve an allocation of markets. The High
                                    Authority has in no way condoned the existence of the agreement.
                                    Up to now, however, it has felt that it lacked the power to take
                                    action against the cartel under the <gloss target="#t_CSC1"
                                        >CSC</gloss> Treaty’s anti-cartel provisions, which could be

                                <p>It would also be possible for the High Authority to establish
                                    maximum export prices if the prices fixed by the cartel were
                                    found to be substantially higher than prices within the
                                    Community and therefore inequitable to importing countries. A
                                    thorough examination in February of <gloss target="#t_CSC1"
                                        >CSC</gloss> export prices, made at the instigation of the

                                    export prices were in fact inequitable. Nevertheless, as a
                                    result of combined expressions of concern from the U.S. and
                                    other governments, the High Authority has currently decided to
                                    renew its investigation of the export cartel. Another favorable
                                    result has been the establishment of a precedent for
                                    consultation between the High Authority and third countries with
                                    respect to <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> export prices and

                                    Provision is also made for consultation with a view to reducing

                                <p>The Department has recognized that such a relationship could form
                                    the basis for restrictive arrangements. It seems clear, however,
                                    from the history and context of the agreement, that the exchange
                                    of information on pricing is designed to reveal the presence of
                                    artificial price factors, such as subsidies or export incentives
                                    which distort trade. The powers of the High Authority in the
                                        <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> Treaty with respect to
                                    prices are, moreover, defined in such a manner as to limit the
                                    possibility of restrictive agreements on prices. It has been
                                    suggested also that the existence of arrangements for

                                    scrap. The High Authority supervises the administration of both

                                <p>The scrap import purchasing arrangements have developed as a
                                    means of coping with the special problems created by the removal

                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Further Considerations:</hi></p>
                        <p>It is apparent that various restrictive arrangements exist among the coal
                            and steel industries of the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>. The
                            steel export cartel has already been discussed. Another example is the
                            German central organization known as <gloss target="#t_GEORG1"
                                >GEORG</gloss> which decides price and sales policies for all Ruhr
                            coal. The High Authority is attempting to reorganize this restrictive
                            system but is encountering determined opposition from the Ruhr industry.
                            In the latter case, as in most cases involving restrictive business
                            practices, there are political and social factors involved as well as
                            economic. Although it is fully realized that action by the High
                            Authority to promote competitive conditions is of vital importance to
                            the success of the Community, it was not expected that the establishment
                            of the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> would quickly lead to the
                            abolition of all restrictive arrangements. There are a number of
                            important factors which must be taken into account such as the
                            complexity of the <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0294"/>problem; the
                            long history of such arrangements in Europe; the limits on the High
                            Authority’s powers for dealing with restrictive arrangements extending
                            outside the Community; the pioneering character in Europe of the High
                            Authority’s efforts; and the long and careful preparation required in
                            undertaking an antitrust action, as shown by U.S. experience.
                            Consequently, although progress is slow, to some extent this is
                            inevitable in the circumstances.</p>
                        <p>Some steps have already been taken by the High Authority against
                            restrictive arrangements and we have been assured that further measures
                            are now in preparation. We consider that there are reasonably good
                            prospects for further progress by the Community in combating such
                            arrangements.</p>

                            <p>The report is correct that the steel producers of the European Coal
                                and Steel Community have established a cartel to fix minimum prices
                                for export from the Community. This has been done without sanction
                                of any organ of the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>. There is
                                evidence that a quota system was introduced in the spring of 1954
                                when the market was slack. However, export quotas were reported to
                                have been abandoned in late summer as a result of the resurgence of
                                demand for steel in world markets. There is no evidence that the
                                cartel has allocated markets.</p>
                            <p>This arrangement, known as the Brussels Convention, was entered into
                                by the steel producers of five of the six member states of the
                                Community shortly before the establishment of the common <pb n="268"
                                    xml:id="pg_268" facs="0296"/>market for steel in May 1953. It
                                covers substantially all of the steel exports of the Community.</p>
                            <p>The High Authority has two possible courses of action against the
                                steel export cartel. It has the power under Article 65 of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> Treaty to act against the export
                                cartel if the cartel’s activities directly or indirectly adversely
                                affect competition with the common market. It is also empowered
                                under Article 61 to fix maximum export prices if existing prices are
                                found to be inequitable to importing countries outside the
                                Community. Both lines of action have been considered by the High
                                Authority.</p>
                            <p>The Department has been concerned about the export agreement since
                                its institution. After consultation with the High Authority, this
                                Government approached the individual governments of the member
                                states of the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> with respect to
                                the possibility of governmental action against the export cartel. No
                                positive results were accomplished by this approach. Our concern
                                about the export cartel was also expressed to the High Authority
                                during the loan negotiations in April 1954.</p>
                            <p>More recently, the Danish Government has raised the subject in
                                various international forums, including the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                    >GATT</gloss>, contending that the export prices fixed by the
                                cartel are inequitable in being substantially higher than <gloss
                                    target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> domestic prices. Such a situation
                                would place Danish steel fabricators at a disadvantage in relation
                                to fabricators within the Community. <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                    >GATT</gloss> consideration of the problem was recently
                                suspended pending outcome of direct discussions between the Danes
                                and the High Authority. The latest advice is that, in these
                                discussions, the High Authority has proved to the satisfaction of
                                the Danes that the Community’s export prices are equitable, there
                                being no significant difference between <gloss target="#t_CSC1"
                                    >CSC</gloss> export and domestic prices. A favorable result of
                                this exercise has been the establishment of a precedent for
                                consultation between the High Authority and third countries with
                                respect to <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> export prices and
                                practices.</p>
                            <p>Although clearly not condoning the activities of the export cartel,
                                up to the present time the High Authority has felt that it does not
                                have the power to act against it under the anti-cartel provisions of
                                Article 65 because of lack of evidence of an adverse effect of the
                                cartel’s activities on competition within the common market. The
                                High Authority has informed us that it intends to renew its
                                investigation of the export price agreement.</p>

                            <p>An agreement concerning relations between the United Kingdom and the

                                December 21, 1954, and is now awaiting ratification. The agreement
                                provides essentially for consultation and the exchange of
                                information between the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">U.K.</gloss>

                                and the High Authority and Council of Ministers representing the
                                Community. This consultation is to embrace a wide range of topics of
                                common interest concerning the production and marketing of coal and
                                steel; and institutional framework—a Council of Associations—is
                                established to facilitate the discussion of them. These topics
                                include such matters as investment policy; pricing arrangements,
                                including subsidies; technical developments and research; supplies
                                of coal and steel and other raw materials; and trends in production,
                                consumption, imports and exports. If possible, before introducing
                                any additional restrictions on trade in coal and steel in time of
                                shortage or oversupply of coal and steel, the <gloss

                                    >CSC</gloss> are to notify the Council in order to permit
                                consideration of coordinated action by the appropriate governmental

                                tariffs and other trade barriers, with a view to their reduction.
                                The main task of the new Council is likely to be the working out of
                                the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> tariff reductions called for
                                under Sections 14 and 15 of the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>
                                Transitional Convention. Negotiations of reciprocal concessions from
                                other countries, and particularly the <gloss target="#t_UKG1"
                                    >U.K.</gloss>, is envisaged in those sections.</p>
                            <p>The High Authority and the United Kingdom have considered the new
                                agreement as primarily of political significance. This indication of
                                    <gloss target="#t_UKG1">U.K.</gloss> support for the Community
                                was regarded not only as a means of strengthening the <gloss
                                    target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> but also as a way of encouraging
                                the advocates of further progress toward European integration.
                                Generally speaking, the State Department has favored the close
                                association of the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">U.K.</gloss> with the
                                    <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>.</p>
                            <p>We have been aware of the possibility that such an association could
                                facilitate restrictive agreements on prices, and have discussed this
                                matter with the High Authority. In light of the provisions of the
                                    <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> Treaty, and the history and
                                context of the relevant sections of the agreement, we consider it
                                unlikely that the agreement will be utilized for such purposes. It
                                seems clear that the consultation on pricing arrangements is
                                designed to reveal artificial factors, such as subsidies, which
                                distort international trade. In addition, the powers of the High
                                Authority with respect to price are defined in such a way as to
                                limit the possibility of its sponsoring or entering into restrictive
                                price agreements.</p>

                            <p>The High Authority currently supervises the operation of a private
                                organization in Brussels (Office Commun des Consommateures de
                                Ferraille, or <gloss target="#t_OCCF1">OCCF</gloss>), which performs
                                certain functions with regard to <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>
                                scrap imports. The <gloss target="#t_OCCF1">OCCF</gloss> determines
                                    <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> scrap import requirements,
                                but, so far as we know, does not administer any system <pb n="270"
                                    xml:id="pg_270" facs="0298"/>of scrap allocation for the High
                                Authority. There is an exclusive scrap purchasing arrangement
                                between <gloss target="#t_OCCF1">OCCF</gloss> and two or three
                                American scrap dealers. This arrangement is tied in with a
                                Perequation Fund to equalize the higher delivered cost of imported
                                scrap with domestic scrap. The High Authority has designated an
                                observer to supervise the administration of both <gloss
                                    target="#t_OCCF1">OCCF</gloss> and the Perequation Fund. This
                                observer participates in all their meetings and must approve any
                                decisions made unanimously by them.</p>
                            <p>The <gloss target="#t_OCCF1">OCCF</gloss> acts as agents for <gloss
                                    target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> scrap importers and negotiates
                                contracts on behalf of the actual importer. The latter is free to
                                select his foreign supplier but if he wants to get the perequation
                                payment, or subsidy, necessary to make imported scrap cheap enough
                                to buy he has to let the <gloss target="#t_OCCF1">OCCF</gloss>
                                negotiate the contract. With respect to scrap imports from the
                                United States, a more rigid system is used. The <gloss
                                    target="#t_OCCF1">OCCF</gloss> has designated two or three
                                American scrap dealers as exclusive agents for scrap purchases in
                                the United States. U.S. scrap may be imported by <gloss
                                    target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> consumers from other than the
                                exclusive agents but no perequation payments are made on such
                                imports. We understand that the exclusive purchasing arrangement
                                with U.S. scrap dealers is scheduled to terminate March 31, but
                                there is a possibility that it will be renewed.</p>
                            <p>Payments into the Perequation Fund were made obligatory by the High
                                Authority on March 26, 1954. These payments are levied on each ton
                                of collected scrap consumed by the <gloss target="#t_CSC1"
                                    >CSC</gloss> steel producers, irrespective of origin. Recently,
                                the High Authority extended for a period of three months the
                                arrangements for perequation of scrap imported from third countries
                                which was scheduled to terminate on March 31, 1955.</p>
                            <p>The scrap import purchasing arrangements have developed as a means of
                                coping with the special problems created by the removal of national
                                barriers to trade within the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>.
                                They were designed to mitigate the impact on the Community of the
                                sudden entry into competition for <gloss target="#t_CSC1"
                                    >CSC</gloss> scrap of Italian steel consumers and to avoid
                                placing at a competitive disadvantage the consumers of imported
                                scrap.</p>
                            <p>There seems to be little question, however, that the High Authority
                                regards the existing scrap importing arrangement as temporary. Last
                                November we were informed that the High Authority did not intend to
                                renew the exclusive purchasing arrangements with U.S. scrap dealers
                                which were scheduled to expire on March 31. Because scrap is
                                apparently in such short supply in the Community now, there is a
                                possibility that the arrangement will be extended. The past record
                                of the High Authority with respect to scrap has been clearly against
                                restrictionism. For example, when the <gloss target="#t_OCCF1"
                                    >OCCF</gloss> was established in April 1953, its principal
                                function was to collect data to establish <pb n="271"
                                    xml:id="pg_271" facs="0299"/>scrap import requirements of the
                                    <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>. Joint purchasing of scrap
                                by the <gloss target="#t_OCCF1">OCCF</gloss> was specifically
                                prohibited by the High Authority. Further, under authority of
                                Article 65 of the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> Treaty the
                                High Authority in June 1953 ordered the liquidation of the German
                                and Italian scrap cartels and prevented the organization of a French
                                scrap cartel. It has been reported recently that the Italian scrap
                                cartel has continued to operate in violation of the High Authority’s
                                liquidation order.</p>
                            <p>The Department has instructed the U.S. Representative to the <gloss
                                    target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> to inform the High Authority that
                                the United States questions the compatibility of the exclusive scrap
                                purchasing arrangement with the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>
                                objectives of establishing and maintaining competitive conditions in
                                the Community. The arrangement suggests a type of restrictionism
                                which impedes progress toward these objectives.</p>
                            <p>The Federal Trade Commission currently is investigating the
                                relationship between U.S. scrap dealers and importers in other

                                ascertain if there has been any violation of the anti-trust

                            <p>An agreement between the United States and the High Authority of the
                                    <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> was concluded in April 1954
                                for the loan of $100 million to the High Authority for the purpose
                                of assisting in modernizing and developing the natural resources of
                                the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>, principally coal and iron
                                ore. The negotiation of the loan followed an expression by President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> of the view
                                that such financial assistance would be concrete evidence of this
                                Government’s support for the movement toward European unity.</p>
                            <p>During the course of the negotiations U.S. representatives expressed
                                concern about the problem of restrictive arrangements both in the
                                export and domestic markets. The president of the High Authority, M.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName>, agreed that this
                                problem was an important one which had to be solved, but which
                                involved many factors. For example, action against cartels in coal
                                involves complex economic and social problems arising out of the
                                displacement of miners. M. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1"
                                    >Monnet</persName> assured U.S. representatives that the High
                                Authority would proceed to deal with the cartel problem as soon as
                                possible. Some steps have been taken and negotiations are presently
                                being conducted with coal operators looking toward the elimination
                                of certain restrictive practices in that industry.</p>
                            <p>The High Authority specifically recognized this Government’s interest

                        <p><gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> believes the cartel problem in Europe
                            is one of long standing with broad political and social as well as
                            economic implications, that during this holding period in the progress
                            towards an integrated European economy the <gloss target="#t_CSC1"
                                >CSC</gloss> finds itself at a relative disadvantage vis-à-vis
                            nationalist and cartel pressures, and consequently is less able to take
                            enough necessary and desired anti-cartel actions. The cartel problem in
                            Europe is a serious one. However, the most serious developments of
                            cartel activity are national ones, notably in Germany and France,
                            against which the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> is struggling.
                                <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> concludes that the only long
                            range solution will be found in healthy conditions of free and expanding
                            economies, and therefore that U.S. foreign economic policy in Europe
                            should emphasize to an ever greater degree, as our aid diminishes,
                            support of economic expansion, productivity, convertibility and
                            reduction of trade barriers.</p>

                                part as follows: “You will undoubtedly wish to consider the adverse

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: The High Authority of the European
                            Coal and Steel Community is concerned by reports that the United States
                            Government is considering the imposition of restrictions on the export
                            of steel scrap. Representatives of the High Authority have had occasion
                            to discuss the problem with the United States Representative to the
                            C.S.C. and detailed technical information has been furnished by the High
                            Authority for the information of the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>I am confident that the United States Government has been fully informed
                            by the United States Representative of the position of the Community and
                            the views of the High Authority, but I feel that, in view of the
                            importance of the issue, I should draw your personal attention to the
                            consequences which might flow from the imposition of quotas on scrap
                            exports. The High Authority might then find that the Community is faced
                            with a serious shortage which would entail the application of the
                            measures provided in Article 59 of the Treaty of the European Community
                            for Coal and Steel.</p>
                        <p>This would mean the establishment of a system of allocation and quotas
                            which would restore national markets for scrap and might impair the free
                            operation of the common market for steel, established under the Coal and
                            Steel Community Treaty. This would be a backward step in the economic
                            integration of Europe.</p>
                        <p>The attention of the Government of the United States is also invited to
                            the close relationship between steel production within the Community and
                            the defense efforts of the member states of the Community. A reduction
                            in the production of steel could unfavourably affect production
                            essential for the defense of Europe. Further, a smaller production of
                            steel within the Community would adversely affect the high level of
                            general economic activity which in recent <pb n="276" xml:id="pg_276"
                                facs="0304"/>months has made an important contribution to increased
                            standards of investment and consumption in Western Europe and which has
                            played its parts in the development of a more stable economic foundation
                            in the West.</p>
                        <p>At the present time, the stocks of scrap available are sufficient for
                            only seven weeks of production. It is essential not only that the
                            exports of scrap to the Community be maintained at the present level,
                            but also that maintenance of supply be assured. Uncertainty could have a
                            seriously damaging effect on scrap price stability and on steel
                            production.</p>
                        <p>With these factors in mind, and taking also into account the legitimate
                            interests of steel producers in the United States, the High Authority
                            would be prepared to examine with the member Governments the possibility
                            of limiting to the present level the volume of scrap purchased by the
                            C.S.C. industry in the United States. Action of this kind by the
                            Community could be considered only if the Community were in a position
                            to count on United States scrap being available up to these limits. If
                            it should not prove possible for the United States Government to agree
                            to such an arrangement, the High Authority feels that the Community’s
                            interests would be safeguarded only if the United States authorities
                            would not reduce scrap exports to the Community below the present level
                            without giving the High Authority advance notice of at least three
                            months.</p>
                        <p>I know, Excellency, of your continued and close interest in the affairs
                            of the European Community for Coal and Steel, and therefore the High
                            Authority has taken this opportunity to place before you this problem of
                            common concern.</p>

                        <p>With regard to the proposal by the Commerce Department that export
                            controls be imposed on ferrous scrap, <gloss target="#t_EUR1"
                                >EUR</gloss> is unprepared to judge whether as a result of current
                            and anticipated exports, an excessive drain of U.S. scrap from the
                            domestic economy is likely to occur. I understand that <gloss
                                target="#t_E1">E</gloss> has reason to believe that there is no
                            economic necessity for the imposition of export controls; we would
                            consider, with you, that in the absence of economic necessity export
                            controls would be contrary to our foreign economic policy of removing
                            all possible trade barriers both at home and abroad. If, on the other
                            hand, there is an economic justification for controls, then <gloss
                                target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss>’s concern would be directed to
                            furthering the establishment of equitable export quotas reflecting a
                            fair balance of domestic needs and foreign requirements of the <gloss
                                target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> countries and the <gloss

                        <p>In this connection I would like to point out to you that the <gloss
                                target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> countries and the <gloss
                                target="#t_UKG1">U.K.</gloss> will be seriously affected by a

                                <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> states that the
                            imposition of quota controls on export of U.S. scrap might entail
                            establishing an internal allocation system in the Community in contrast
                            to present free operations and, through restoration of national scrap
                            markets, result in a backward step in European economic integration. He
                            also outlines the relationship between steel production in the Community
                            and the defense efforts of the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>
                            members and the possible effect of controls upon the total level of
                            economic activity in Europe. In conclusion, M. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> suggests to us that the <gloss
                                target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> governments might study possibilities
                            for limiting U.S. scrap purchases to the present level or, if the U.S.
                            could not agree to this, then the U.S. should consider not reducing
                            scrap exports to the Community below the present level without at least
                            three months advance notice.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. shares the strong interest expressed in <persName

                            defense production of our allies. Reduced availabilities of U.S. scrap
                            would also be of serious concern to the <gloss target="#t_UKG1"

                                <gloss target="#t_UKG1">U.K.</gloss> is counting on greatly
                            increased imports of scrap from the U.S. in order to fulfill its steel
                            production program on which depends both its vital export market and
                            continuation of its present rate of defense production.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss> position is that our foreign

                            would be served by further assessment not only of U.S. but also of other

                            controls is made. If a decision to impose controls cannot be avoided,
                            then it is important that the level of exports from the U.S. be
                            sufficient to avoid various unfavorable repercussions on our objectives
                            and interests in Europe. In the first place, the quotas established
                            should be at a level sufficiently high not to weaken the economies of
                            friendly countries needing U.S. scrap. Secondly, quotas should be at a
                            level which will not invite cut-backs in the defense industries of our
                            allies. In addition, quotas should bear some equitable relationship to
                            amounts available to U.S. scrap consumers. Lastly there should be full
                            and frank consultation on the various aspects of our scrap problem with
                            the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> and with interested countries in
                            order that they realize that their interests are being considered to the
                            fullest possible extent. Adherence to these standards might well be of
                            more importance to our relationships with friendly countries concerned
                            than the actual imposing of export control.<note n="3" xml:id="d88fn3"

                        <p>The idea of giving new impetus to European integration appears to be
                            gaining support in a number of European capitals and is reflected in
                            proposals for additional fields of activity for the European Coal and
                            Steel Community. The clearest and most concrete summary of this
                            development is contained in a recent letter from the Acting U.S.
                            Representative to the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>, reporting on

                            to take further steps towards creating a united Europe. Their immediate
                            objective, he reports, is to extend the scope of the <gloss

                            and atomic energy within the six countries. A single legislative
                            Assembly and Court of Justice would continue to serve the enlarged

                            States policy concerning the Community should be subject to further
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>The Department’s comments<note n="4" xml:id="d90fn4"><ref target="#d84"
                                    >Document 84</ref>.</note> (Tab E) stressed the following
                            points: (1) The High Authority has made some progress in enforcing the
                            anti-cartel provisions of the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> Treaty
                            and there are reasonably good prospects for substantial further
                            progress. While its pace appears slow, this is inevitable in the light
                            of the complexity of the problem, the length of time entailed in
                            preparation of antitrust actions, the pioneering character of these
                            steps in Europe, and the consequent political and social resistances
                            which are met. (2) The problem cannot be considered apart from the
                            general cartel problem in Europe. (3) The <gloss target="#t_CSC1"
                                >CSC</gloss> is of central importance as a step toward European
                            integration.</p>
                        <p>The Department’s comments concluded that (1) the United States should
                            continue its strong support for the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>;
                            (2) the United States should continue to encourage the High Authority to
                            use its powers to develop a competitive market for coal and steel; and
                            (3) the facts currently available do not warrant a reconsideration of
                            United States policy toward the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> at
                            this time.</p>
                        <p>Recommendations 1 and 2 of <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> 520/3
                            (Tab C) revised are consistent with the Department’s position.
                            Recommendation 3 of <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> 520/3 revised
                            suggests a further study be made by the Department <pb n="281"

                                    <p>M. <persName corresp="#p_CA2">Coppe</persName> prefaced his
                                        remarks by noting that cartels had existed in Europe for at
                                        least 60 years prior to the establishment of the Coal-Steel
                                        Community and that rapid changes could not be expected in
                                        this field. One of the major problems in dealing with the
                                        cartel situation resulted from the fact that the centralized
                                        organization of coal enterprises had assured an equilibrium
                                        of production and employment among all the coal mines.
                                        Employment was spread out equally in all mines under this
                                        system. A reorganization of the coal agencies which might
                                        result in great disparity of employment as among the mines
                                        would alienate workers and be very damaging to the future of
                                        the Community. M. <persName corresp="#p_CA2"
                                            >Coppe</persName> believed that the High Authority now
                                        had a reorganization plan which took these social and
                                        economic factors into account and was hopeful that industry
                                        and labor would go along with it. The High Authority was
                                        under an obligation to report on this subject to the Common
                                        Assembly at its extraordinary session in May, at which time
                                        M. <persName corresp="#p_CA2">Coppe</persName> thought there
                                        would be some encouraging news to report. It was this report
                                        which he had in mind when he referred to the possibility of
                                        action in the next two months in his Press Club

                                        overtaken their production goals in this sector. Expanded

                                        particularly imported scrap for steel production appears to
                                        be a long-run problem. What consideration is the <gloss
                                            target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> giving to this problem?</p>
                                    <p>M. <persName corresp="#p_CA2">Coppe</persName> agreed that
                                        the steel industry in the <gloss target="#t_CSC1"
                                            >CSC</gloss> was overly dependent on scrap, noting that
                                        Italy’s steel industry was based on an 80% use of scrap and
                                        France used 50% scrap in making steel. The steel industry,
                                        however, was becoming aware of this problem and the High
                                        Authority was encouraging steel producers to increase the
                                        use of pig iron as against scrap in the steel making
                                        process. M. <persName corresp="#p_CA2">Coppe</persName>
                                        considered significant progress along these lines, however,

                                        three years. In the meantime, he emphasized the need for a
                                        continuation of scrap exports at current levels from the
                                        U.S. to the Community which was essential for maintaining
                                        the Community’s high level of steel production. He expressed
                                        the High Authority’s appreciation for the continued flow of
                                        scrap from this country.</p>
                                    <p>He pointed out that there was strong pressure on the High
                                        Authority, especially from France, for the imposition of
                                        maximum prices and formal allocation of scrap and that it
                                        was only because the U.S. had continued to export large
                                        quantities of scrap that the High Authority had been able to
                                        resist such pressure. The High Authority did not wish to
                                        establish maximum prices, since this would freeze the
                                        already artificially low scrap prices in France and the
                                        Netherlands, thus perpetuating the problem of incentives for
                                        increased scrap collection in the Community. The High
                                        Authority was also opposed to allocation since this would
                                        involve the re-establishment of national scrap markets
                                        within the Community resulting in a serious set-back to the
                                        integration of the steel market. If the U.S. cut back on its
                                        export of scrap to the Community, M. <persName
                                            corresp="#p_CA2">Coppe</persName> emphasized that the
                                        High Authority would be forced to declare an emergency
                                        situation within 48 hours and impose maximum prices and
                                        allocation of scrap.</p>

                                        on exports of steel scrap from the U.S. will continue

                                    <p>M. <persName corresp="#p_CA2">Coppe</persName> was asked
                                        whether he thought the Italian steel industry could be
                                        competitive if it relied more heavily on pig iron instead of
                                        scrap, since this would require additional coking coal which
                                        Italy had to import and expanded blast furnace capacity. M.
                                            <persName corresp="#p_CA2">Coppe</persName> said that he
                                        was convinced that the Italian industry could be competitive
                                        under these conditions. He noted that there was no longer
                                        much advantage in using domestic coal as against imported
                                        coal since it had been demonstrated that U.S. coal could be
                                        delivered in Italy at about the same price as coal from
                                        Germany. He thought the raw materials situation in steel had
                                        been changing considerably, that the countries of the
                                        Community, including Italy, were becoming aware of these
                                        changes and were moving to take advantage of
                                    them.</p></item>

                                        use part of these funds for housing?</p>
                                    <pb n="286" xml:id="pg_286" facs="0314"/>
                                    <p>M. <persName corresp="#p_CA2">Coppe</persName> first noted
                                        that there was actually only $25 million remaining to be
                                        allocated from the U.S. loan, since $10 million had been set
                                        aside for Italy and Belgium for industrial uses. The final
                                        transfer of the $10 million to Italy and Belgium was held up
                                        by some special problems. In Italy, the problem was the
                                        proposed imposition of taxes by the Italians on the loan,
                                        which had the effect of increasing the interest rate from 4%
                                        to approximately 8%. The High Authority was now attempting
                                        to work this out with the Italians and was hopeful that this
                                        problem would soon be settled. In Belgium the question
                                        involved power stations at the coal mines involving
                                        political difficulties with the electric power industry.
                                        Regarding the use of the remaining U.S. loan, M. <persName
                                            corresp="#p_CA2">Coppe</persName> said that he thought
                                        that the U.S. funds could probably not be used in France
                                        where there was difficulty in obtaining guarantees on
                                        exchange rates. He stressed, however, the tremendous
                                        psychological impact of housing sponsored by the Community,
                                        stating that workers were very proud of the housing already
                                        built under <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> auspices.
                                        The existence of these houses was a dramatic expression of
                                        the Community as a concrete achievement. There was a great
                                        need for housing in the Community, and the High Authority
                                        was planning to move ahead in this field primarily with
                                        funds borrowed in Europe, with perhaps in addition some
                                        drawing on the U.S. loan funds. He said he was not sure of
                                        the latest developments with respect to the possible use of
                                        the U.S. loan for housing.</p></item>

                                    <p>Prospects for further expansion of the common market were
                                        encouraging. M. <persName corresp="#p_CA2">Coppe</persName>
                                        thought that the initiative would be taken by the <gloss

                                        France was currently unable to take the lead and it was
                                        undesirable for Germany to assume leadership, for political
                                        reasons. The <gloss target="#t_Benelux1">Benelux</gloss>
                                        countries are primarily interested in moving forward to a
                                        customs union on a six-country basis within the framework of
                                        a supranational organization. Experience with their own
                                        customs union arrangements had persuaded the <gloss
                                            target="#t_Benelux1">Benelux</gloss> of the necessity
                                        for this type of framework for a larger country grouping.
                                        The <gloss target="#t_Benelux1">Benelux</gloss> countries,
                                        however, had no objection to an expansion of the Community
                                        which would proceed along functional lines and they
                                        understood that the French were prepared to accept further
                                        sector integration in the fields of transport, electric
                                        power, energy and fuel. He indicated there might be certain
                                        difficulties due to international ramifications of the
                                        industry bringing fuel oil under a supranational authority.
                                        The possibility of bringing peaceful uses of atomic energy
                                        within the Community, he considered most exciting and
                                        promising, since there were no vested interests in this
                                        field as yet and since it was a wave of the future which had

                                        might be integrated on a six-country basis would come under
                                        the existing <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>
                                        institutions, since this framework was well established and

                            and labor leaders. After noting his own earlier skepticism regarding the

                            country, he cited the gradual and highly desirable change in European

                            referred to his work as director of a U.S. fund which finances visits to

                            some of the fund’s awards were specifically for the purpose of
                            familiarizing Belgians with the advanced work of our universities in

                                <persName corresp="#p_CA2">Coppe</persName> said it was rather
                            surprising that the Community, despite all the difficulties contemplated
                            and dire predictions, had gone into operation so easily and
                            successfully. He said that many influential opponents of the <gloss
                                target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>, including some in his personal
                            acquaintance, were now warm supporters of it, and that the possibility
                            of achieving European integration by successive stages was no longer in
                            doubt.</p>
                        <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0316"/>
                        <p>Among the notable successes of the Community, he mentioned the removal of
                            price controls throughout most of the coal and steel industry. This he
                            described as producing a minor revolution in European thinking, which
                            had become addicted to “dirigism.”</p>
                        <p>In answer to inquiries, he mentioned the current economic boom in Europe,
                            and noted that it had not resulted from external forces, as
                            traditionally in the past. He stressed that this development was giving
                            Europe a new confidence in the ability of its economy to grow and
                            expand.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CA2">Coppe</persName> mentioned various
                            proposals to extend the scope of the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>
                            to embrace other economic sectors (transport, industrial and atomic
                            energy), noting that there was no doubt that the existing Community
                            would serve as the framework for any such extension of European
                            integration on supranational lines. In response to a question about the
                            possible title of such an expanded Community, he said that they were now
                            using the title “Community for Coal and Steel” in order to facilitate
                            the linking on of names of other economic sectors in the future.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CA2">Coppe</persName> emphasized that the
                            inclusion of atomic energy in the Community would have a profound effect
                            in promoting European integration, since it would identify the Community
                            with the power of the future and capture the public imagination. Mr.
                                <persName>Hoover</persName> noted that atomic power was, in fact,
                            for the purposes of the Community, another way of generating electric
                            power, and many of the problems of atomic power, e.g. transmission,
                            etc., were actually problems common to electric power produced from coal
                            or water power. Mr. <persName>Hoover</persName> also stressed that it
                            would be a considerable time before atomic power could be produced
                            economically, and there might be some danger to the Community of
                            building up hopes of immediate benefits. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CA2"
                                >Coppe</persName> said that he thought they could deal with that
                            problem even if it took five or ten years before such power was in
                            general use, so long as it was clearly on the way. He referred to the
                            President’s interest in assisting other countries in developing peaceful
                            uses of atomic energy and suggested that the U.S. might wish to consider
                            directing its efforts in a way that would promote the integration of
                            Europe.</p>
                        <p>Prior to the group’s joining Mr. <persName>Hoover</persName>, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> informed Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CA2">Coppe</persName> that attention in the United
                            States, in connection with the Community, was focused on the question of
                            restrictive business practices and the possibility of the <gloss
                                target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> dealing with such practices. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CA2">Coppe</persName>, in his remarks, noted
                            that the European cartel tradition made the High Authority’s task an
                            especially difficult one, but affirmed the High Authority’s recognition
                            of the importance of using its powers to bring about more competitive
                            conditions, and their determination to proceed ahead towards this
                            objective. He cited the <pb n="289" xml:id="pg_289" facs="0317"/>current
                            stand against the powerful Ruhr coal cartel (<gloss target="#t_GEORG1"
                                >GEORG</gloss>) as a leading example of their effort to combat
                            restrictive practices. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName>
                            also asked whether the High Authority would be able to use the U.S. loan
                            in ways that would help combat restrictive practices. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CA2">Coppe</persName> answered that this was not
                            feasible. He cited other apparent benefits from the loan, however: in
                            encouraging European lenders to offer credit to the High Authority, and
                            to extend loans to <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> enterprises on
                            terms which break away from the postwar pattern of short maturities and
                            high interest rates. These favorable results of the U.S. loan were also
                            referred to later in the conversation with Mr.
                                <persName>Hoover</persName>.</p>

                                    would discuss the question at Messina with an open mind.

                            and atomic energy. To accomplish these goals, the Ministers appointed an

                        <p>[Here follows discussion of German reunification.]</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> hoped the Federal
                            Republic would not weaken its emphasis on the need for the unification
                            of Europe. If that continent <pb n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0320"
                            />can attain unification, it can achieve a strength to balance the
                            Soviet part of Europe. The US believes that the possibilities for
                            Western European recovery and attainment of great strength are immense.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> feared that
                            there may have been recently some decline of interest in this objective
                            in Germany.</p>
                        <p>Minister Erhard countered that the Secretary took too pessimistic a view
                            of the matter. He, Erhard, was a personal believer in a unified Europe.
                            The doubts in Germany over unification were not political in nature but
                            rather questioned the method that was followed in the Coal and Steel
                            Community as being the appropriate one to follow in general. He observed
                            that it was he who had been responsible for the conference at Messina.
                            The German Government was anxious to attain the maximum degree of
                            freedom in Europe, most notably freedom of movement by individuals and
                            migration. On the basis of this type of freedom real freedom in Europe
                            could be attained. Then unification could come. Moreover, the Coal and
                            Steel Community had not been intended to stand alone but to be combined
                            with European Defense Community and other combinations. Erhard pointed
                            out that he had proposed a European capital fund to aid the weaker
                            countries, notably southern Italy.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> said that the
                            people of the US and Congress believed firmly that the division of
                            Europe was the cause of wars in the past. The Europeans have an
                            obligation to tie themselves together and to attain strength in that way
                            so that it will not be necessary to call upon the US again. Any
                            weakening in the move towards unification would be disillusioning here.
                            The reason Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> has
                            a strong following in the US is that the US thinks of him as a
                            European.</p>

                                >AE</gloss> uses he stressed immense political importance European
                            integration this field. “It is question creating common organization
                            with common budget permitting financing installations and research in
                            course or to be started. Such organization could obtain results which
                            countries could not obtain singly due lack resources. Organization
                            should have free access to ore resources of member countries and should
                            facilitate free exchange knowledge and technicians”. Organization would
                            not have monopoly but would have “power of decision”. “Arrangements
                            concluded previously between member countries and third parties should
                            be such that member countries could fulfill obligations to organization.
                            It will be necessary to examine such accords to see if they compatible

                            Belgium do so directly, he hedged and said that main question was one of
                            principle, i.e., pool member countries must be in position, if pool to

                            with various U.S. Government officials; notably, Mr. <persName

                                xml:id="d100fn5"><persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">David K.E.
                                    Bruce</persName>, former U.S. Representative to the European
                                Coal and Steel Community.</note> He said he remembered with the
                            greatest pleasure having made the acquaintance of General <persName

                            attached to his friendship with American officials.</p>
                        <p>Monsieur <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> himself took the
                            initiative in discussing the question of U.S. Government representation
                            to the Coal and Steel Community. Quietly but firmly he reviewed the
                            following considerations in assessing the relative advantages of direct
                            representation and representation by a deputy, resident in Luxembourg,
                            of the U.S. Ambassador to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>–<gloss
                                target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>. No question of personalities was
                            involved. He said he attached the greatest importance to the
                            disassociation of the Coal and Steel Community from military
                            organizations and programs for Western Europe; Switzerland and possibly
                            Austria could play important roles in the expansion of the Community
                            into the fields of power and transportation, and as neutral nations they
                            would be precluded from being associated with any organization with a
                            military color. Monsieur <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName>
                            recognized that the business of the Coal-Steel Community might not be
                            sufficiently taxing to justify assignment of a really top-flight
                            American official on a full time basis. He intimated that he would not
                            take exception to the use by the U.S. of its appointee for economic
                            duties in connection with <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, the
                                <gloss target="#t_ECE1">ECE</gloss>, etc. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> inquired if assignment of
                            Coal-Steel Community representation to Minister Buchanan might serve our
                            mutual purposes. Monsieur <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName>
                            replied that this would be most unwise.</p>
                        <p>Monsieur <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> said that he felt
                            confident that all six countries agreed in the views he had stated above
                            and that if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> raised the
                            matter with Monsieur <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName>, he
                            would echo the same views.</p>

                        <p>As a final comment on this subject, Monsieur <persName corresp="#p_MR1"
                                >Mayer</persName> said that now was a crucial time for the U.S. to
                            show an active and real interest in the future of the Coal-Steel
                            Community.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> said that he would

                            to the Assistant Secretary for European Affairs and to Mr. <persName

                            would be.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_AK1">Konrad Adenauer</persName>, German Chancellor,
                            arrived in the United States on June 13 for a series of discussions with
                            United States officials over a 3-day period. In a conversation of June
                            14 with Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                            >Dulles</persName>, the question of European integration was discussed.
                            A portion of the memorandum of that conversation by Cecil B. Lyon,
                            Director of the Office of German Affairs, reads in part as follows:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Secretary referred to his Paris discussion on the question
                                    of European integration with the Chancellor and said that the
                                    American people continue to have tremendous concern in this
                                    question. He added that there has been recently a slight feeling
                                    that of late the Chancellor’s views may have altered on the
                                    subject of European integration. However, the Secretary felt
                                    that on the basis of the talks with the Chancellor that such a
                                    feeling is not correct. The Secretary stated he believes we have
                                    taken steps forward both politically and militarily and that
                                    such concepts as the Coal and Steel Community were good and
                                    should be held on to.</p>
                                <p>“The Chancellor replied that he was in full agreement and only
                                    the day before his departure from Germany he had discussed the
                                    matter with Economic Minister Erhard and the latter had told him
                                    of his talk when in Washington with the Secretary. He, Erhard,
                                    stated that he was a determined friend of European integration.
                                    The Chancellor added that he had instructed Professor <persName
                                        corresp="#p_HW1">Hallstein</persName> to push forward on
                                    this matter at Messina but the French would not go along. The
                                    Chancellor reminded the Secretary that this was an election year
                                    in France and there was no uniform opinion in France with
                                    respect to European integration. This situation must be taken
                                    into account and the Chancellor did not think it was possible
                                    for the present to establish any further supra-national
                                    organizations, although <persName corresp="#p_PA1"
                                        >Pinay</persName> himself was a friend of integration.</p>
                                <p>“The Secretary expressed regret that his friend <persName
                                        corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> was not longer in a
                                    position to help in this field.” (Department of State,

                            months when the <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> study of

                            principal foreign consumers of U.S. scrap the desirability of achieving
                            a proper balance in the use of scrap and pig iron and the desirability
                            of avoiding undue dependence on the United States as a source of scrap.”

                            the statement that he assumes this resolution of the problem closes the

                        <p>This action by the Commerce Department represents a complete victory for
                            the State Department’s position on this question and is the culmination
                            of several months’ efforts by Department personnel, our <gloss

                            imposition of quantitative export controls on scrap.</p>
                        <p>The decision to continue the existing policy on scrap exports will be
                            regarded by the High Authority as further evidence of U.S. support of
                            the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_CA2"
                                >Coppe</persName>, during his recent Washington visit, stressed the
                            importance of a high level of U.S. scrap to the maintenance of the
                            common market in scrap. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName>, in
                            a letter to the Secretary, also urged the continuation of exports to the
                                <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> at the current level.</p>
                        <p>Existing U.S. scrap controls are an open-end type with certain
                            administrative safeguards, permitting a generally free flow of scrap
                            abroad. The principal foreign consumers of U.S. scrap are the countries
                            of the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_UKG1"
                                >UK</gloss>, and Japan. Initially, we were the only agency on the
                            inter-departmental Advisory Committee on Export Policy opposed to
                            quantitative controls on scrap exports and we undertook <pb n="299"
                                xml:id="pg_299" facs="0327"/>a single-handed, comprehensive effort
                            to convince the other agencies that the economies and defense build-up
                            of our foreign allies would be adversely affected by a reduction in U.S.
                            scrap exports. We also held that the other agencies had failed to prove
                            that U.S. security interests were being damaged by the free flow of the
                            scrap abroad. If any single factor can be isolated as the most
                            influential in substantiating the Department’s position, I would select
                            the letter from the High Authority on the importance of a continuation
                            of U.S. scrap exports and the action in support of this letter by
                                <persName corresp="#p_ER1">Robert Eisenberg</persName> and
                            Department staff in <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss> also resisted undertaking immediate,
                            strong representations to the principal foreign consumers on the
                            desirability of avoiding undue dependence on U.S. scrap, which Commerce
                            wanted as a condition to agreement not to impose additional controls. It
                            was our view that vigorous approaches along these lines had recently
                            been made, that follow-up at this time would not be productive, and that

                                    >Andrew N. Overby</persName> was in Italy as part of a larger
                                trip to several European countries, following the <gloss
                                    target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> Council meeting in Paris.</note>
                            In the course of the conversation, Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_MG1">Martino</persName> expressed concern that during
                            the past months there has been no strong expression of interest in
                            European integration on the part of the United States. Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_MG1">Martino</persName> also expressed the
                            hope that either the Secretary of State or some other high American
                            official could find the opportunity in the near future to make a strong
                            statement to the effect that the United States still regarded European
                            integration as an important objective.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the Foreign Minister’s remarks to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_OAN1">Overby</persName>, it is of interest that at the
                            time this Embassy outlined to the Foreign Office the views contained in
                                <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 3849 of May 30,<note n="3"

                            were several private comments by Foreign Office officials expressing
                            regret that the U.S. had not seen fit to give stronger support not only
                            to the idea of European integration, but also to the <gloss
                                target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> as the sole European institution with
                            supranational authority. These officials recognized that the United
                            States would not and could not become involved in the choice of the
                            timing and structure of European integration, but they believed that a
                            neutral statement of general support for integration, following the
                            extremely active support of <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss>, might
                            be interpreted as a decrease of United States interest in the
                            achievement of a workable integration of Europe in the economic, and
                            eventually political, fields.</p>
                        <p>The Italians still consider full European integration as a cardinal point
                            of their foreign policy, but are aware of their deficiencies in relation
                            to acting as a guiding spirit. As the weakest nation economically of the
                            six <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> countries, Italy must proceed
                            with some caution in the process, but there is little doubt that Italy
                            desires progress of a general nature on the road of integration.</p>
                        <p>At Messina the Italians were concerned by the fact that the French
                            insisted that they could not accept any arrangement which might require
                            another Parliamentary debate involving the European system. The Italians
                            were also concerned that the Germans showed signs of irritation with the
                            French position and made it clear that Germany no longer saw reason for
                            it to take advanced European positions when France always held back.
                            Added to these preoccupations was the then unofficially expressed worry
                            that the United States was becoming luke-warm toward integration.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy believes that Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MG1"
                                >Martino</persName>’s request for a statement by the United States
                            merits serious consideration. At the same time, it is noted that the
                            Netherlands Foreign Minister believes <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301"

                                results. “He said he was extremely grateful for United States moral
                                support, which he said was and is invaluable” <persName

                            desirable for the United States to give further private indication at

                            goal.</p>

                            despatch evaluating the Messina Resolution in the light of the position
                            papers and plans which the various delegates brought along. Pressure of

                                850.33/6–1555)</note> made it impossible for me to write the
                            despatch as planned. In the meantime, the Department has received all
                            the information necessary and I trust that, if required, the report will
                            be written in Washington.</p>
                        <p>There are, however, a few aspects of the “relance” of the European
                            integration on which I would like to comment.</p>
                        <p>As far as I can ascertain, the interested officials of the six countries
                            feel that real progress toward integration can be expected only in the
                            field of atomic energy. With regard to transportation, electric power
                            and other forms of energy, little more than coordination of <pb n="302"
                                xml:id="pg_302" facs="0330"/>development programs is expected to
                            result from the work of the <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>
                            Committee. There is not much scope for integration in these fields nor
                            can any willingness be discerned on the part of the Governments for
                            radical changes. The creation of a “European common market” on the other
                            hand, is considered by officials in several of the six countries as a
                            pretty nebulous project. Some form of a customs union might be achieved
                            in the long run but not much is expected to be worked out, in terms of
                            specific agreements, for considerable time. The fact that free movement
                            of labor, harmonization of credit and social policies are listed in the
                            Messina Resolution among the elements essential for the creation of the
                            European common market, indicates how little realistic it would be for
                            the time being to expect that this part of the Messina program will come
                            to fruition.</p>
                        <p>With regard to atomic energy, all six countries have indicated more
                            definitely than in other respects their desire to cooperate and even to
                            create a common organization with appropriate responsibilities and
                            powers. There may be some doubt as to whether the French are ready to
                            agree to the creation of a European authority for atomic energy— . . . .
                            Nevertheless, there is a definite pressure on all the six countries to
                            cooperate in research and development in this field, resulting from
                            their belief that individually they would be too small to keep up with
                            the big nations and also from the fact that their coal industry already
                            forms a common market and any problems for the coal resulting from the
                            development of atomic energy would necessarily have to be handled
                            jointly.</p>
                        <p>When discussing the prospects of the implementation of the Messina
                            Resolution with European officials who are close to this work, I am
                            impressed by the general optimism which they show with regard to
                            integration in the field of atomic energy. It is generally expected that
                            the <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> group will succeed in
                            working out proposals for integration in this field and some of my
                            sources believe that eventually the central powers will be in the hands
                            of a reorganized High Authority or of another, similar supranational
                            institution. It is not believed that the United Kingdom will participate
                            in any closer form than that of an association. In fact, the British do
                            not seem to find it easy to decide on sending an observer to the work of
                            the <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> group. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BBJW1">Beyen</persName>, when raising this question ten
                            days ago, was told that the cabinet would have to decide what the
                            British position would be.</p>
                        <p>In the eyes of many European officials, the success of the present plan
                            to create a European Community for atomic energy depends to a large
                            extent on the attitude of the United States. Two reasons are advanced in
                            this connection: first, the leading role which the United States plays
                            in the field of atomic energy and, secondly, the existence of the
                            US-Belgian energy agreement and of other bilateral <pb n="303"
                                xml:id="pg_303" facs="0331"/>agreements. It is believed that the
                            United States could kill the new integration plan outright if we insist
                            on making bilateral agreements with each of the six countries. On the
                            other hand, it is believed that the United States could supply a strong
                            impetus to integration in the field of atomic energy and in this way to
                            European integration in general.</p>
                        <p>I was glad to note that several posts have specifically raised the
                            question of United States policy in this matter. It might take some time
                            before a firm US policy can be developed and perhaps will be considered
                            necessary to wait for some more tangible proofs of the European will to
                            integrate in the field of atomic energy before US policy is fixed. It is
                            obvious that pending a decision on US policy it is essential to avoid
                            taking a position which might be interpreted in Europe as rejection of
                            the atomic pool idea but I think it might be desirable for US Government
                            to make clear that we have an open mind on the possibility of European
                            integration in the atomic energy field.</p>

                            <p>P.S. I heard yesterday some more on the <gloss target="#t_UKG1"
                                    >UK</gloss> position on the question of cooperation with the
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> Committee.
                                Apparently the British Government is waiting for a formal invitation
                                to participate in order to reply. The six governments, on the other
                                hand, might wait for the <persName corresp="#p_SPH1"
                                    >Spaak</persName> Committee to convene before the invitation is
                                sent out so that it could be sent in the name of the Committee.</p>
                            <p>Of more importance is an indication I received that the British
                                attitude might be more positive than originally expected. It seems
                                that there is a feeling in the British Government that the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> has to participate with the six
                                countries in the technical development work on atomic energy. The
                                British participation in the work of the <persName corresp="#p_SPH1"
                                    >Spaak</persName> Committee might therefore be more than that of
                                sending an observer since they would want to participate in the
                                discussions and drafting of agreements dealing with cooperation in
                                this particular field. The 6 countries, on the other hand, will
                                certainly want to go further in their own cooperation than joint
                                work in the field of technical development. They will want to do
                                some joint planning, financing, and investment in the field of
                                actual exploitation of atomic energy rather than only the
                                development activities.</p>

                            <item>The President’s forthcoming message to the Congress on his program
                                for the peaceful uses of atomic energy raises the question of our
                                attitude towards the proposal for a six-country European Authority
                                for atomic energy on a Schuman Plan basis. As presently drafted, the
                                message would permit United States cooperation in the research
                                reactor field with regional groupings of nations with deficient
                                resources. It does not address itself, however, to cooperation with
                                groupings of states in the power reactor field nor to groupings
                                which might be inspired by a desire to have a more effective program
                                by pooling their resources. Cooperation with such groupings would
                                seem to be authorized by Sec. 124 of the Atomic Energy Act.<note

                            <item>As you know, the Foreign Ministers of the six Schuman Plan
                                Countries agreed at Messina to study various proposals for the
                                revival of the European integration movement, and in particular the
                                pooling of atomic energy resources for peaceful purposes. The
                                Germans and Belgians at least feel that atomic energy provides the
                                best basis for a dynamic program to give new life to the integration
                                movement because of (1) the need to pool inadequate resources in
                                this field, (2) the relative absence of vested interests, and (3)
                                the appeal of the peaceful atom to the public imagination. They will
                                probably propose the creation of supranational authority in this
                                field, while the French seem to favor something more along Western

                                        <p>“There may well be circumstances in which the technical
                                            and material resources of several nations could best be
                                            utilized through a voluntary grouping of their
                                            resources, or in which the means available to a single
                                            nation do not appear adequate to take advantage
                                            effectively of the two programs which I have proposed.
                                            In these circumstances the U.S., in carrying out its
                                            part in these programs, would support a voluntary
                                            grouping of the resources of several nations within a
                                            single region. For example, the member states of the
                                            European Coal and Steel Community have recently taken a
                                            decision to study the peaceful development of atomic
                                            energy through a common organization. We should be in a

                                            result from this study.”</p>

                        <p>In a memorandum of this date, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1"
                                >Merchant</persName> recommends that you agree in principle that we
                            would treat a European atomic energy authority (modeled on the Schuman
                            plan) in the same way as we would treat a national state. He also
                            recommends that the President make a positive statement along this line
                            in his forthcoming message to Congress on atomic energy cooperation;
                            that we explore modifying our atomic energy agreement just signed with
                            Belgium to remove bars to integration; and that we hold up any more
                            power reactor bilaterals with Schuman plan countries pending further
                            study of integration.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_SAE1">S/AE</gloss> does not concur with these
                            recommendations. We have checked informally with the Atomic Energy
                            Commission and are advised that the Atomic Energy Commission is also not
                            prepared to agree with the proposed position at this time.</p>
                        <p>Atomic power cooperation has just been initiated with the <gloss
                                target="#t_UKG1">U.K.</gloss>, Canada, and Belgium, the three
                            countries with whom we have been most closely associated in atomic
                            energy development since the war. In studying possible atomic power
                            cooperation with any other country, difficult problems arise, and
                            greater problems appear if multilateral cooperation under the Atomic
                            Energy Act is considered. As a practical matter, it is not clear that
                            the Act envisages any multilateral cooperation in the peaceful uses of
                            atomic energy except with an International Atomic Energy Agency. The
                            attitude of the Schuman plan countries toward atomic energy integration
                            has by no means been officially established—especially in France and
                            Belgium—despite enthusiastic favorable statements by individual
                            officials. While atomic energy integration is an attractive goal, there
                            are only vague concepts at present as to what it would mean.</p>
                        <p>With regard to modifying our just concluded agreement with Belgium, this
                            agreement is most important to our national security and to defense of
                            the Free World, and is also considered highly important by the Belgian
                            Government. Modification may not prove <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307"
                                facs="0335"/>consistent in important respects with either our
                            national interest or the Belgian interest.</p>
                        <p>In view of these and other uncertainties, we should not at this point
                            adopt a policy of support for a European atomic energy authority, even
                            in principle, or make an announcement of such support which we may find
                            it difficult to implement. We need first to make sure that integration
                            is practical and is desired by the European countries, and also that the
                            U.S. is in a position to cooperate with such an authority.</p>

                                    practical integration. This necessity arises from two
                                    considerations: unless Western European nations integrate
                                    further in present period relative prosperity, existing bonds on
                                    basis steps already taken could not survive economic depression
                                    if one came; also unless Germany integrated with West more
                                    closely, growing nationalism could make Federal Republic

                                    neutralization. Way to minimize both these dangers is to achieve
                                    soon further close integration from which none of European
                                    nations could easily break away; last chance to do so lies in

                                    summarized the Federal Republic of Germany’s views on Western
                                    European integration. It reads in part as follows:</p>
                                <p>“Officials of the Federal Republic Foreign Ministry concerned
                                    with European integration say that the Federal Government is
                                    firm in its determination to pursue integration as a matter of
                                    policy. Concern about the dangers of economic depression and of
                                    Soviet appeals to German nationalism are said to underlie this
                                    determination. Restraints on progress toward integration are
                                    attributed largely to the French, although some internal
                                    resistance in the West German Government is acknowledged. While
                                    a general supranational approach is considered ideal, the sector
                                    approach is accepted as practically attainable, especially with
                                    regard to transportation and energy, including atomic energy.
                                    This last is in fact seen as most quickly attainable and most
                                    susceptible of supranational arrangement, and there is much
                                    interest in extent to which the United States might assist.”

                                    and Spierenberg the U.S. views on European atomic energy

                                    position on this issue would be decisive for the success or

                                    field. He also suggested that <persName corresp="#p_SPH1"
                                        >Spaak</persName> should be informed at once about the U.S.

                                    offered in part the following views:</p>
                                <p>“I have taken no steps to convey to <persName corresp="#p_SPH1"
                                        >Spaak</persName> substance of Department telegram 12 to

                                    has been clarified. I am convinced that <persName
                                        corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> is personally willing to
                                    discuss with us any arrangements vis-à-vis French which would be
                                    necessary in connection with genuine integration in atomic
                                    energy field but Belgians are definitely wary of French moves
                                    which have so far appeared to them as means of obtaining Belgian
                                    uranium rather than real concern for European integration. It is
                                    my understanding that <persName corresp="#p_SPH1"
                                        >Spaak</persName> conveyed idea to French at Messina that
                                    Belgian position did not preclude consideration of the question

                        <p>When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJII1">Palmer</persName> was here he
                            indicated that the Department had in mind the possibility that further
                            steps for European integration might be taken through the expansion of
                            the work of the Coal and Steel Community into the field of atomic
                            energy. Similarly instructions from the Department relating to the
                            proposed work of the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> in this field
                            have explicitly warned our representatives against approving the <gloss
                                target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> as the appropriate channel for
                            European activity in atomic energy and instructed them to make sure that
                            the way was kept open for the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> to
                            operate in this field.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> has begun his campaign to
                            arouse public opinion in Europe in support of a United States of Europe;
                                <persName corresp="#p_BBJW1">Beyen</persName> has visited the <gloss

                            which they propose of further steps toward European integration. The
                            communiqué issued in Messina is, however, extremely vague as to what
                            these six countries have in mind. I am informed that <persName
                                corresp="#p_BBJW1">Beyen</persName> gave practically no further
                            clarification to the British ministers when he met them here. It would
                            appear, therefore, that the six countries are starting in de novo to
                            examine possible further steps toward the integration of Europe. It is
                            also certain that they will run into extremely powerful opposition from
                            vested interests in, industry and those having vested interests in
                            existing institutions for European cooperation, such as the <gloss
                                target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>. The British are unlikely to give a
                            very enthusiastic answer to <persName corresp="#p_BBJW1"
                                >Beyen</persName>’s approach; in fact, the answer they do give is
                            certain to be very cautious and accompanied by many reservations. In
                            addition the Scandinavian countries have a great deal of suspicion of
                            any proposals of this kind emanating from the six countries. It would
                            appear, therefore, that the road ahead for the proponents of integration
                            is long and rough.</p>
                        <p>If one looks back at the origins of the institutions which now exist for
                            integrated or cooperative effort on the part of the European countries,
                            one is struck by the fact that each one of them came into being and
                            derived its vitality from some major and immediate political need or
                            because of some important outside catalyst. The <gloss target="#t_CSC1"
                                >CSC</gloss>, for example, came into being primarily because of the
                            compelling need of finding a way of rapprochement between France and
                            Germany after the war. Its origins and the forces which brought it into
                            being over much determined opposition were fundamentally political
                            rather than economic. The <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> was
                            created by the Marshall Plan; its original function was to plan the use
                            of U.S. aid. Later the highly constructive and useful European Payments
                            Union came into being because the capital was contributed by the U.S.
                            These institutions have been administered, and on the whole
                            well-administered, by the Europeans. They are truly European
                            institutions. But their basic parentage was American.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was made possible by
                            U.S. contributions of men and military strength. <gloss target="#t_WEU1"
                                >WEU</gloss> was made possible by the British promise to maintain
                            troops in Europe.</p>
                        <p>As one looks around the European scene now, no such catalyst of further
                            progress appears on the horizon. Much has been accomplished in the way
                            of more effectively organized cooperation (as distinguished from
                            integration) through the establishment of <gloss target="#t_WEU1"
                                >WEU</gloss> and the expansion and perfecting of the work of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                                >OEEC</gloss>. But there seems to be little cause for hope that any
                            further important move toward what might be called the <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> type of approach can be
                            expected.</p>
                        <pb n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0339"/>
                        <p>The only place where an outside stimulus comparable to those mentioned
                            above would appear to be possible is in the field of atomic energy. So
                            far, few vested interests exist in this field in Europe. The
                            potentialities for development and use of atomic energy in such a big
                            area as Europe are enormous. The cost to individual countries of
                            developing separate resources would be tremendous. But they are likely
                            to proceed along separate lines unless forestalled by something
                            better.</p>
                        <p>Therefore if we genuinely believe that the integration of Europe can be
                            furthered by development of a further supranational institution similar
                            to the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>, or through expansion of the
                                <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>, it would seem that atomic
                            energy offers the only real possibility for immediate action. Either we
                            or the British could initiate it—perhaps we could do it jointly. The
                            influence we could exert on the form of the European institution to be
                            developed by reason of the contribution that we would be in a position
                            to make would be great. We could in effect provide the capital for an
                            atomic <gloss target="#t_EPU1">EPU</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>If we are taking this idea seriously, we should act fairly quickly,
                            either ourselves, or by trying to get the British to do it, or by joint
                            action. Because if we don’t, countries will proceed as far as they can
                            on a piecemeal basis (as we and the British are now helping them to do)
                            and we will shortly find unscrambling or merger of individual country
                            activities in the atomic field as difficult as in other more established
                            forms of trade and energy.</p>

                            satisfactorily. As you probably recognize, the Messina meetings and the
                            resulting resolution have attracted a great deal of attention in
                            Washington, and there is sure to be keen interest in the work of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> Committee. As you know,
                            the Secretary continues to show a strong personal interest in the fate
                            of European integration.</p>
                        <p>As we see it, the Messina meetings have served mainly as a “holding
                            action” on the integration front, with any serious decisions left for
                            the future. It appears that the conflicts within and among the <gloss
                                target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> Governments with regard to future
                            measures of integration remain unresolved. On the other hand, it is
                            rather impressive and encouraging that the idea of relaunching the
                            integration movement is being seriously considered so soon after the
                            defeat of the <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss>. We will be interested
                            in any signs that the conflicting governmental views are being
                            reconciled, although we are rather dubious that much can be accomplished
                            at the moment, given the present divisions within the French Government
                            of Gaullist and “European” elements. Some further Department comments
                            which may be relevant to the Brussels meetings are incorporated in our

                        <p>There is particular interest in the Department in the possibility that
                            the Europeans may decide to develop the peaceful uses of atomic energy
                            on an integrated basis. While we would have to reserve final judgment
                            until we see just what is proposed, it is clear that the Department
                            would consider a European decision to create a real common atomic
                            authority on Schuman Plan lines as being in our interests, as a way of
                            reviving European integration and supporting the <gloss target="#t_CSC1"

                            such an atomic authority is a more complicated problem, involving as it
                            does our bilateral relations with the Belgians, French sensitivities,
                            limitations imposed by the U.S. Atomic Energy Act, etc. These problems
                            are currently receiving our attention and it will undoubtedly require
                            some time before we can provide any meaningful guidance. I mention this
                            because I am afraid that you will have to walk a pretty tight rope
                            between lending discreet encouragement to any European initiative in
                            this field and avoiding any commitments or even encouragement as to the
                            extent to which we might be able to cooperate.</p>

                                    His reply reads in part as follows:</p>
                                <p>“I was very happy about the clarification of U.S. policy which
                                    was in our hands a week ago and which supplemented the telegram
                                    to Rome in connection with the Messina Resolution. However, I
                                    dare say you will have to speak in much stronger tones when you
                                    want all the interested posts to present your views to their
                                    respective Foreign Offices in unequivocal manner. Integration
                                    along the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> pattern is an idea
                                    which is new and let us say often suspicious not only to the
                                    countries which might be involved as partners but very often
                                    also to the diplomats who are representing our country there.
                                    This applies in varying degrees probably in all six countries,
                                    although one or the other of our Embassies is quite conscious of
                                    the political importance of further European integration.”

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJII1">Palmer</persName> summarized the United
                            States attitude toward European integration with a special reference to
                            the Schuman plan. He <pb n="314" xml:id="pg_314" facs="0342"/>said that
                            future European efforts towards integration may well have to be in a
                            “sector approach” e.g., atomic energy, communications, transportation,
                            etc. A move forward in the atomic energy field would have several
                            attractions to the United States. It would be consistent with the
                            expressed views of the President and Congress in support of European
                            unity. The absence of vested interest in the atomic energy field make
                            this perhaps the most attractive area in which future efforts toward
                            integration might take place. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJII1"
                                >Palmer</persName> noted the Secretary’s approval in principle of
                            American efforts to encourage a move towards integration in the atomic
                            field by the Europeans. Therefore, the first step was to explore with
                            the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> some of the complications,
                            legal, security, and engineering, that might arise should the Europeans

                                >Cleveland</persName> explained that the group is covering the
                            entire power picture of which atomic energy would be a segment and this
                            portion is to be covered by a separate Subcommittee. The Subcommittee
                            will meet for the first time this week. The Subcommittee is called upon
                            to make a preliminary report by October 1, 1955 to the Ministers. He
                            noted that there is a German paper making proposals in this field which

                            its economics, therefore, a six-nation approach would have a better
                            chance of success. Secondly, there are clear advantages to be derived
                            from large capacity power reactors. He admitted that there were problems
                            raised by the bilaterals but the real point he wished to make was that
                            in his view a better climate was created for the development of nuclear
                            power if one were dealing with six-nation approach (Mr.
                                <persName>Davis</persName> then left).</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJA1">Hall</persName> inquired as to the
                            attitude of the British toward the idea of European integration in this
                            area. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJII1">Palmer</persName> said that the
                            British seemed to be more interested in cooperative efforts within the
                                <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> framework than in a six-nation
                            approach. It was emphasized that it was most unlikely that the <gloss
                                target="#t_UKG1">U.K.</gloss> would participate in a European atomic
                            energy authority, consequently the existing <gloss target="#t_UKG1"
                                >U.K.</gloss>–U.S. bilateral agreement would <hi rend="italic"
                                >not</hi> raise problems.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ER1">Eisenberg</persName> suggested the paradox
                            of Belgian initiative in proposing a six-nation approach while at the
                            same time their bilateral <pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0343"/>with
                            us is a stumbling block. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJII1"
                                >Palmer</persName> agreed that there was a difficult tactical
                            situation here. The Europeans do look to us for guidance and are keenly
                            interested in our views as to the direction in which they might move and
                            yet the initiative must remain theirs. Our concern is that we continue
                            to show sympathetic interest while at the same time we consider in
                            Washington the obstacles which might seem to stand in the way of
                            European initiative and whether it is feasible to remove these
                            difficulties. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ER1">Eisenberg</persName> asked
                            whether we needed to view the bilateral agreements as an obstacle. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HJA1">Hall</persName> said that in the sense
                            that a European agency affects Belgian capacity to supply uranium it
                            would seem to be an obstacle.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJA1">Hall</persName> then raised the technical
                            question as to who needs natural uranium. The French seem to have all
                            they will need for the next ten years. It would appear then that the
                            recent request of the Belgians by the French was a bargaining move. As
                            far as uranium ore availability and cost is concerned he suggested that
                            there was no benefit to be gained by regionalism. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PJII1">Palmer</persName> observed that it was not in
                            terms of raw material that integration of atomic efforts seems to be
                            especially promising but rather in the area of exchanging information
                            and development. He also agreed with a point that Mr.
                                <persName>Davis</persName> had made earlier on the advantages of
                            six-nation approach.</p>
                        <p>In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJA1">Hall</persName>’s point
                            that when the countries got around to constructing nuclear power plants
                            they would undoubtedly be built by and within the individual national
                            states, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CSM1">Cleveland</persName> said that
                            he felt an integrated approach would have a bearing on where such plants
                            were to be constructed. While it is true that a single European grid
                            does exist today, national enterprises still can cut off the energy flow
                            to the grid when the power is needed in the originating state. It would
                            be hoped that an integrated approach would avoid this narrow
                            nationalism.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJA1">Hall</persName> asked what the
                            relationship of a European atomic authority would be to the new
                            international agency. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName>
                            replied that he had discussed this matter with Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PM1">Patterson</persName><note n="4" xml:id="d111fn4"

                                policy with regard to the proposed International Atomic Energy
                                Agency.</note> and that the latter saw no problem. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PM1">Patterson</persName> felt that if the six nations
                            were to get together along the lines being discussed this would enable
                            them to make a greater contribution to the agency and this was
                            consistent with the notion that these industrialized European powers
                            should be viewed more as contributors to the agency, rather than
                            beneficiaries. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ER1">Eisenberg</persName>
                            pointed out that the draft statute would require the six nations to
                            participate in the work of the agency as <pb n="316" xml:id="pg_316"
                                facs="0344"/>individual states, even if they should decide to pool
                            their atomic energy efforts.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJR1">Schaetzel</persName> stressed the
                            advantage of making full use of the time element. Various European
                            nations are now beginning to make decisions which will set the pattern
                            for the development of atomic energy in the future. It may be possible
                            to make “European” decisions now in the absence of private or
                            governmental vested interests which might be difficult or impossible
                            several years from now and after <hi rend="italic">national</hi>
                            programs are well entrenched.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJA1">Hall</persName> noted that the French
                            have told us that they would like to talk about breeder reactors which
                            raises difficult problems for us. He said that the Germans have also
                            indicated their interest in negotiating and that there is no reason to
                            think that either nation has changed its mind. He was suggesting,
                            therefore, that these countries were not talking about 6 kgs of
                            fissionable material but about large amounts and classified information.
                            He felt that the legal officers should consider this problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Wells</persName><note n="5" xml:id="d111fn5"
                                    ><persName>Algie A. Wells</persName> of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>.</note> said the arguments in favor
                            of an integrated European approach were so persuasive that if the
                            present statute might not be considered to permit cooperation by the
                            U.S. with such an authority he felt confident that the law could be
                            changed. Congress has been most amenable to suggestions for modifying
                            the statute. He noted that Section 123 was not drafted in such a manner
                            as to be clear on this point and unfortunately, Section 144 deals with
                            military matters. While Section 124<note n="6" xml:id="d111fn6"
                                >Reference is to sections of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.</note>
                            might be of some help he said he could not be sure what it means. His
                            instinct, because of the importance of European cooperation in this
                            area, was not to attempt to bend the present law to accommodate European
                            ideas.</p>
                        <p>It was important to consider at this juncture the practical problems.
                            There was first the matter of classified data. The Belgian agreement is
                            the only one covering this subject and yet even here, no information has
                            passed or will pass until the Belgians install an adequate security
                            system. He posed the difficulties for us in considering the transmittal
                            of classified data to France. In dealing with a pool it would be
                            necessary to consider the security problem of the whole to be that of
                            the worst single unit. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UL1"
                                >Unger</persName><note n="7" xml:id="d111fn7"><persName
                                    corresp="#p_UL1">Leonard Unger</persName>, Officer in Charge of
                                Political-Military Affairs, <gloss target="#t_RA1"
                                >RA</gloss>.</note> suggested that we could take some heart in the
                            precedent for the transmittal of secret information in the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> agreement. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> pointed out that we are dealing
                            with a different group of people with different ideas of security than
                            those of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military officers.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJA1">Hall</persName> said that the classified
                            data issue was a problem all over the world. Hope for the <pb n="317"
                                xml:id="pg_317" facs="0345"/>future seemed to be in declassification
                            of power technology. We may then get down to the problem of custody of
                            fissionable material. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName>
                            said he could not imagine a transfer of classified information to a
                            six-nation entity. If one were dealing with a Latin American regional
                            group the United States might get away with an arrangement for the
                            transfer of unclassified data and would have essentially a problem of
                            material custody. However, in Europe with their scientific proficiency
                            one must anticipate that they will want data which is on the frontier of
                            research and development. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJA1"
                                >Hall</persName> remarked that a high percentage of the information
                            on power reactors has been declassified and in a short time this might
                            well be true of the balance. However, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1"
                                >Smith</persName> questioned whether the declassification approach
                            would satisfy the Europeans. They will always want to have access to
                            advanced technology.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJA1">Hall</persName> said he felt it was quite
                            wrong to deal with this broad area of nuclear information on a
                            classified basis. Indeed the present statute contains a mandate to
                            declassify rapidly such data. He felt pressure from American business
                            would speed the process. We can anticipate a point in the not too
                            distant future when the problem will be one of material accountability
                            only and not one of classified information control.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ER1">Eisenberg</persName> suggested that if the
                            USSR comes forward with substantial information we might have a
                            competitive race in declassification.</p>
                        <p>Returning to the subject of U.S. cooperation with a European authority,
                            Mr. <persName>Wells</persName> said he saw no reason why we could not
                            work with such an agency. He noted, however, that the individual country
                            or countries could not transfer restricted data unless the United States
                            agrees, and the transfer would have to be to a country with which we
                            would have a bilateral of similar scope. He said he disliked seeing the
                            Belgian agreement presented as a stumbling block to a possible move
                            towards European atomic integration. On the other hand, it would be most
                            imprudent, in urging the Europeans to take the initiative in
                            establishing an authority, for us to mislead them on the dimension of
                            the security problem. Perhaps we should suggest the need for them to
                            bring their security standards up to a tolerable level. He was impressed
                            by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName>’s point of the
                            likely desire of the Europeans for the most advanced information.
                            Certainly France would have no real interest in an organization
                            concerned with unclassified information.</p>
                        <p>As one of the factors that might draw France into a European authority
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ER1">Eisenberg</persName> noted the appeal to
                            the French ego of being able to assume the role of scientific
                            leadership. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJII1">Palmer</persName> added
                            that there was also an advantage to France of being able to use this
                            means of controlling German nuclear development.</p>
                        <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0346"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJA1">Hall</persName> questioned whether a
                            problem did not arise from the fact that American companies were
                            authorized and encouraged to export technology and yet they would be
                            forced in this instance to deal with a governmental entity. It was
                            pointed out that American business in the past has shown no reluctance
                            in dealing with governmental purchasers. In any event, there was a
                            strong likelihood that even if an authority were established individual
                            contracts would be between European national entities and American
                            suppliers. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> said that it
                            would be up to American industry to make a judgment as to whether a
                            prospective sale was to its advantage.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJII1">Palmer</persName> questioned whether the
                            ambiguity of Section 124 of the law might not be resolved through
                            consultation with the Joint Committee. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJR1"
                                >Schaetzel</persName> suggested that rather than confine a
                            consultation to this narrow point would it not be desirable to discuss
                            with the Committee on an exploratory basis the question of European
                            integration in the field of atomic energy and the steps which the
                            Europeans are now contemplating. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1"
                                >Smith</persName> felt that it might be possible to do this the next
                            time there is a meeting with the Committee to consider <gloss
                                target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Given the security situation in France Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJA1"
                                >Hall</persName> said he could not recommend to his superiors that
                            an agreement for cooperation containing the exchange of classified data
                            be consummated now with France. As for the suggestions that the European
                            nations be encouraged to institute security systems comparable to ours,
                            this brought one up against one of the real problems which is the
                            resistance of the European scientific community to this approach. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HJA1">Hall</persName> speculated that if we
                            were to push hard for the general installation of security systems the
                            effect might well be to kill the entire notion of a six-nation authority
                            by eliminating the scientists.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> suggested that we might
                            be overstating the problem of the bilaterals for after all, the
                            Europeans have great scientific and industrial resources. There is a
                            real question of how much they require our assistance. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HJA1">Hall</persName> agreed that they may not require
                            the information, but they will need the enriched materials, at least
                            initially. Mr. <persName>Wells</persName> said that this would not
                            create such difficult problems for we could probably draw up an
                            agreement covering the custody of material. He agreed with Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> that it was hard to see that the
                            bilaterals amounted to such an obstacle.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that in the light of the preceding discussion an attempt
                            should be made to draft an instruction to the field which would endeavor
                            to relate the bilateral agreements for cooperation to the notion of a
                            European atomic authority. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1"
                                >Smith</persName> also suggested that it would be useful to explore
                            this entire matter further with some of the people in the field in the
                            course of the International Conference for the Peaceful Uses of Atomic
                            Energy.</p>

                                    pointed out that he had heard a rumor that the United States

                                    peaceful purposes between the United States and the Federal

                            yesterday. He told me that he was more convinced than ever of necessity
                            for continued progress towards unification of Europe. He said this was
                            necessary both for obvious economic reasons and even more important to
                            provide a pole of attraction to hold peoples of the West together
                            against the ideological push of Communist powers. He said he felt this
                            was particularly important for the Socialist parties of West Europe. If
                            the movement toward European unity ceased to be concrete reality
                            Socialists would lose it as an issue and would be forced to return to
                            their fundamental Marxist philosophy which would make it more difficult
                            for them to resist Communist appeals for united action. <persName

                                generally similar to that with England.</item>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> felt that the latter step was
                            most important as indicating a concrete and immediate step in the
                            direction of European unity and was of even greater importance for its
                            long range effects. He said that the only difficulty with the creation
                            of this pool was the special position of France which had substantially
                            more knowledge on atomic energy than any of the other countries who
                            would join this pool. He did not think there was any possibility that
                            the British would join and felt that their representation at Brussels
                            was merely for the purpose of getting first hand information on
                            developments.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> said that to prevent the
                            European atomic energy pool from becoming a political football in the

                            essential that other countries coming into the pool contribute what they
                            can so that the French Government could tell the Assembly that in
                            joining the pool they were obtaining certain concrete advantages in
                            return for the contribution of French technical knowhow. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> said that the one case in point
                            was Belgium with her sources of uranium in the Congo. He said that the
                            French fully understood the necessity for the large United States share
                            in the Congo output, as, after all, this ore was being used for the
                            protection of the free world. <persName corresp="#p_MR1"
                                >Mayer</persName> felt that the essential point must be an agreement
                            in principle that Belgium would contribute to the European pool a
                            substantial share of the uranium ore which is left to her under the
                            Belgian-United States agreement. He said further that Congo uranium was
                            important to the pool as it could be produced at a price very much
                            cheaper than French uranium which is the only other source presently
                            available to the European pool.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MR1">Rene Mayer</persName> said he had not talked

                            matter as he considered it to be a governmental question between France
                            and Belgium and in view of his present international position he
                            considered it improper for him to discuss the question with <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>. He said that he wanted the

                            he attached to the prompt creation of a European atomic energy pool and
                            as to his view that this would require a contribution by Belgium of

                            leaving soon for Geneva to attend the International Conference on
                            Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy (August 8–20). It is likely that, outside
                            the scope of the Conference itself, his views will be sought by
                            representatives of various European countries on proposals to create a
                            European Atomic Pool. Since any expression of U.S. views on proposals
                            for integration in peaceful atomic development could have a substantial
                            impact on the course of events in this present formative stage, it is

                            at this time.</p>
                        <p>In talking to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>, you
                            may wish to make the following points: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The U.S. Government is pursuing a policy of fostering and
                                    supporting the movement toward political federation and economic
                                    integration of Western Europe. This policy has received strong

                                    The movement towards European unity has potential political,
                                    economic, and military benefits for Europe and the free

                                <item>In the European Coal and Steel Community, six nations have
                                    taken an important step towards integration in the transfer of

                                    federal institutions. Further steps in this direction were

                                    European integration now appears to be the creation of a

                                    responsible for the development of atomic energy for peaceful

                                    influence on the European decision concerning the pattern of
                                    peaceful atomic development: i.e. whether to proceed on an

                                    see what the Europeans are prepared to propose, from the point
                                    of view of our foreign policy a European decision to create a
                                    real common atomic authority along Schuman Plan lines would be
                                    in the U.S. interest. Such a decision would contribute strongly

                                    Coal and Steel Community. I said that it was the policy of the

                                    enlargements of its functions as a supernational agency for the

                                    was not able to judge the technical value of what it planned.
                                    This would have to be judged by Admiral <persName

                            in German opinion. The obvious most fruitful area of development seems
                            to me in the peaceful use of atomic energy. I would appreciate it if you
                            would give this matter some urgent thought and also let me know where we
                            stand on the feasibility of an atomic peaceful pool arrangement under
                            existing U.S. law. I would also like your thoughts as to the most

                        <p>On August 17, the Advisory Committee on Export Policy discussed a
                            proposal by the Department of Commerce to place an export quota on
                            ferrous scrap and semifinished steel products. At the Secretary of
                            State’s staff meeting of August 18, <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName> was informed of this development. (Notes of the

                            Meetings: Lot 63 D 75) Later that morning, the Secretary discussed the
                            Commerce proposal with President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> during a telephone conversation. A memorandum
                            of that conversation, prepared in the office of the Secretary, reads in
                            part as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Sec. said something had come up in staff mtg this morning
                                    which disturbed him. The Commerce <gloss target="#t_Dept1"
                                        >Dept</gloss> was planning to put on an export quota on
                                    steel scrap. That will raise havoc with the Coal and Steel
                                    Community etc. The price has gotten up a little and they want to
                                    have the export quota on to break the price. Sec. said he didn’t

                                    that this was very much against the <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325"

                                    see placing an embargo on it in case of war but didn’t
                                    understand this. Sec. said that it was taken up in the Dodge
                                    Cmte. The President wanted to know if Commerce could do this
                                    without his approval. They discussed this and agreed Commerce
                                    couldn’t. The Pres. suggested we call Commerce and say the Pres.
                                    has gotten wind of this and did not want any action until it has
                                    his approval.” (Eisenhower Library, Dulles Papers, White House

                            presented sufficient justification for the establishment of the proposed
                            export quotas on scrap at this time.” It was also recognized that
                            additional factors which had not been presented might warrant a further
                            review of the matter by the Council at a later date and the <gloss

                        <p>The question of export controls on ferrous scrap and semifinished steel
                            was considered further at the next meeting of the Council, held on
                            August 30. According to the minutes of that meeting, drafted by
                                <persName corresp="#p_CLCPH1">Cullen</persName>, the following
                            decision was reached: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“It was agreed that present circumstances do not clearly indicate
                                    a long-term problem sufficiently serious to justify either
                                    temporarily or permanently changing the foreign economic policy
                                    with respect to export controls. However, it was recognized that
                                    there is the possibility that a more serious situation may
                                    develop that would make it necessary to take steps to protect
                                    the availability of the domestic scrap supply. Therefore the
                                    problem should be kept under close scrutiny by interested
                                    Departments and the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> for

                        <p>I am persuaded that we should try to deal with the German problem as you
                            suggest but that two difficulties seem to preclude an injection of
                            decisive U.S. influence within a short-time framework. First, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> and other “Europeans” want us to
                            stay in the background at this stage (Tab B).<note n="6"

                                efforts.</note> Second, our law limits our present room for
                            maneuver. Following adjournment of the current Geneva conference,
                            however, <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> can hardly avoid entering
                            into active and urgent consultations with <gloss target="#t_SAE1"
                                >S/AE</gloss> and the regional bureaus to appraise the political and
                            security implications of the massive and to some extent competitive
                            interchanges of information which have been taking place. These
                            consultations must, I believe necessarily, deal with the problem of
                            security which is at the heart of our lack of political maneuver under
                            present circumstances. I would hope that <gloss target="#t_EUR1"
                                >EUR</gloss> could participate so as to accelerate changes in <gloss

                            consistent with national security, would give us the greater flexibility

                        <p>On September 30 Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>
                            met with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von
                                Brentano</persName> and his advisers in Washington to discuss
                            matters of mutual concern to the United States and the Federal Republic
                            of Germany. The following portion of their conversation concerned
                            European integration: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“<persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brentano</persName> said that he had
                                    no further questions. Later he would perhaps like to discuss
                                    certain aspects of European policy. Any support that the United
                                    States might give would be psychologically and politically of
                                    great importance for European cooperation. He had in mind
                                    particularly keeping alive the European idea. Europe had grown
                                    rather ‘tired’ with respect to integration policies after the
                                        <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss>, and it was recognized
                                    that the situation probably would remain quiet until after the
                                    French elections. <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brentano</persName>
                                    thought that it would be particularly helpful if the United
                                    States made it unmistakably clear that it was interested in
                                    pooling atomic energy in Europe. If it were made known that
                                    future support of the United States depended on continued
                                    progress toward integration, this would provide a most useful
                                    support. <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brentano</persName> said
                                    that he would report later on the Messina conference.</p>
                                <p>“The Secretary said that the United States took a deep interest
                                    in this topic of integration in Europe. He thought that there
                                    was perhaps no aspect of foreign policy which had more unanimous
                                    support in this country and the Congress. They were convinced
                                    that only troubles and wars could come from the continued
                                    division of Europe. The Secretary had been shocked at Geneva
                                    when he heard <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>
                                    say that he wished to see Europe restored to the condition it
                                    was in on the outbreak of World War II. For what reason, the
                                    Secretary failed to see. The United States would be completely
                                    discouraged about the future of Europe and our association with
                                    Europe if the only prospect was to go back to those conditions.
                                    Therefore, the Federal Republic could count on the United States
                                    throwing its weight in any practical way behind any reasonable
                                    program leading toward European unification. Such a program
                                    would catch the imagination of the young people of Europe, who
                                    would be provided with the opportunity to build something new
                                    and better. With regard to the atomic pool, this was an idea
                                    toward which we were sympathetic, but until <pb n="331"
                                        xml:id="pg_331" facs="0359"/>the European plans were made
                                    more precise, we would not wish to commit ourselves to something
                                    which was unknown and which might not be possible under present
                                    legislation. What we could do would depend very much upon the
                                    European plan. However, the Secretary perceived no difficulty in
                                    getting our legislation altered in order to permit cooperation
                                    with the European countries on a combined basis.” (Memorandum of

                            he believes intergovernmental committee on European integration will
                            come up with some significant progress but that one of areas of
                            difficulty is kind of atomic pool proposal which will emerge. He asked
                            me to recommend that US Government let it be known that German
                            industrialists would gain no advantage through bilateral agreement with
                            US, not be had through participation pool. I told him my Government was
                            sympathetic to Messina effort but that on his specific suggestion I had
                            no idea what my Government’s reactions would be but would report his

                                    of US position might force Germans to give up lone wolf
                                    approach. Basic question is whether US would consider supplying
                                    for next few years adequate quantities nuclear fuel to European
                                    agency. Without such assurance, Germans will continue seeing
                                    better prospect for themselves in bilateral deal with US and
                                    refuse joining European agency. Indications are Belgians willing
                                    to make certain concessions to prevent breakdown negotiations.”

                            efforts to implement Messina agreement without having assurance that

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RR1">Rothschild</persName> told Embassy officer he
                            continues to believe that useful projects will come out of
                            intergovernmental committee’s work, especially in atomic energy and
                            common market areas. He said that efforts of atomic energy working
                            committee had not yet reached decisive stage, even on expert level,
                            which he emphasized all working committees are. He said large number of
                            difficulties of varying degrees of importance had naturally been
                            encountered from time to time as experts tried to work out their
                            problems but that these difficulties were being overcome and he felt
                            optimistic that progress would continue to be made. He said he wished to
                            urge that too much importance not be attached at this stage to the
                            problems of any given day, and added that what would count would be the
                            final report to the Ministers which <persName corresp="#p_SPH1"
                                >Spaak</persName> would be able to get the chiefs of delegations to
                            agree to. He said that to be specific as regards the atomic energy
                            working committee, some difficulties were being encountered due to the
                            attitude currently being adopted by certain German industrialists. The
                            Embassy officer then inquired if <persName corresp="#p_RR1"
                                >Rothschild</persName> saw a present utility in the US Government’s
                            endeavoring to be helpful, adding that he did not, of course, know that
                            the US Government would be able to take any specific action but that he
                            wished to have <persName corresp="#p_RR1">Rothschild</persName>’s
                            personal view.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RR1">Rothschild</persName> replied that he believes
                            that it would definitely be premature for the US to take any action at
                            this time, either as regards atomic energy pool or general progress of
                            intergovernmental committee. He said he felt Belgians working here and
                            through their friends in Germany would be able to overcome present
                            difficulties and emphasized once again that atomic energy working
                            committee has still not completed its work at expert level and that even
                            the work of the experts would be inconclusive, since maneuvering on the
                            political level would really begin when work on overall report underway.
                            He added Belgium still had measure of bargaining strength in atomic
                            energy field due to its special relationships with US.</p>
                        <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0362"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RR1">Rothschild</persName> added that if situation
                            revealed that some action by US would be helpful he would not fail to
                            raise matter informally with US.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RR1">Rothschild</persName> told Embassy officer
                            that atomic energy working committee had not been able to meet since
                            October 7, due solely to inability of members to come together. He
                            anticipates its next and presumably last meeting will occur October 26
                            or 27 and that this committee’s report should be available early
                            November. Other working committee reports now completed and copies will
                            be air pouched Department upon receipt. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1"
                                >Spaak</persName>’s drafting group has already tackled common market
                            question and <persName corresp="#p_RR1">Rothschild</persName> said
                            Belgians were pleased with French proposal in this field. Although it is
                            not audacious, it is the first constructive integration proposal
                            emanating from French Government in 3 years. He added on highly
                            confidential basis that paper had French Cabinet approval. French paper
                            received too late to be incorporated in final report of common market
                            working committee but two will be blended together in <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>’s final report.</p>
                        <p>Embassy officer got impression that fact problems encountered in day to
                            day work at expert level have been extensively reported by US Missions
                            has come to attention Belgian Foreign Office and that they believe it
                            would be unfortunate if too much importance were attached status of
                            intergovernmental committee’s work at any preliminary stage. In this

                        <p>In present state of Brussels talks, it is obviously too early for US to

                            operation without governmental participation or interference. Moreover
                            the impression is growing in Germany that the Germans will be able to
                            make a better deal bilaterally with the United States on the provision
                            of fissionable material than would be possible through a multilateral
                            agreement with the United States. M. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1"
                                >Monnet</persName> was assured that the United States Government was
                            anxious to cooperate with any multilateral agency created in this area
                            because it believed that a further impetus toward European integration
                            could <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0366"/>derive from the
                            establishment of such a pool. The nature of the cooperation of the
                            United States and in fact the initial determination that cooperation of
                            any sort was possible would necessarily depend upon the form which such
                            a European agency developed. Our attitude, however, was sympathetic and
                            whereas there were procedural and possibly statutory complications on
                            the part of the United States, the intent was present to work with any
                            such agency to the maximum extent feasible. M. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> was also told that we were aware
                            of the attitudes developing in Germany and that our Ambassador at Bonn
                            had been authorized informally to let the Germans know that there was no
                            reason to suppose that any nation would benefit by bilateral agreement
                            with the United States beyond the benefits which could be expected to be
                            available for a European agency. They were also to be told that we were
                            following this development with great interest and close attention
                            because of the hopes it seemed to hold for a further move toward
                            integration in Western Europe.</p>
                        <p>M. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> seemed pleased with this
                            information. He expressed the desire, however, to talk further to the
                            Secretary on the subject and stated his intention during the course of
                            the Foreign Ministers Conference to make a visit to Geneva for that
                            purpose.</p>

                            to Rome 3849 of May 30, and particularly the first sentence of paragraph
                            5, still represents the Washington position.<note n="2" xml:id="d125fn2"

                            assume that the principal point of that telegram, i.e. the distinction
                            between “cooperation” and “integration"—which appears to us to be still
                            valid—does not present any problem.</p>

                        <p>While the sentence to which you specifically refer is a truism if taken
                            literally, it is open to varying interpretations. It was intended to
                            convey the thought that decisions in Europe on such a fundamental
                            political issue as the need for countries to surrender national power to
                            federal institutions, can be effective only if they arise out of genuine
                            and strong European convictions. I believe that there is general
                            agreement in Washington and <gloss target="#t_USRO1">USRO</gloss> to
                            this extent. The implications which should be drawn from this with
                            regard to the desirable extent and scope of U.S. action to influence
                            such decisions have not been, and perhaps cannot be, spelled out in
                            detail.</p>
                        <p>There are various unstated premises, however, which underlie our tactics,
                            in addition to the substantive policies of the telegrams you cite, and
                            it might be useful to mention these briefly although without attempting
                            a precise formulation. We wish to encourage and support those Europeans
                            whose views parallel those of the Department on the great importance of
                            continuing progress in integration. At the same time we wish to avoid a
                            series of pitfalls: over-commitment or inflexible commitment to a course
                            of action that ultimately may not prove acceptable in Europe; U.S.
                            involvement unnecessarily in details of European planning; U.S. public
                            statements which are likely to be interpreted abroad as undue U.S.
                            intervention or arouse more public antagonism than support. Naturally,
                            we can never be sure in advance that any proposed U.S. action meets all
                            these requirements but I think that they are the principal tactical
                            considerations we weigh in the balance.</p>
                        <p>I would be glad to have any comment or reaction you may have to this line
                            of thinking.</p>

                                    Authority, its approval will be sought for a U.S. expert group
                                    to consult with the High Authority on the comparative

                                    Department hopes that the creation of such a group would enable

                                    provide an occasion for advising the High Authority generally on

                        <p>The antitrust provisions of the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>
                            Treaty are the principal basis on which the High Authority can proceed
                            against restrictive business practices and, together with their powers
                            to eliminate a range of national trade barriers, promote a more
                            competitive market for coal and steel. These provisions prohibit all
                            restrictive agreements in the first instance (Article 65) and provide
                            for review of mergers and consolidations of enterprises which might
                            prevent the maintenance of effective competition in a substantial part
                            of the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> (Article 66).</p>

                        <p>Although the High Authority has comparatively little experience in this
                            field and few if any precedents to rely on, a number of significant
                            actions have been taken against restrictive practices during the
                            slightly more than two years that the antitrust provisions have been in
                            effect. Three formal decisions calling for the liquidation of three
                            national scrap cartels have been issued; three other scrap cartels have
                            been liquidated voluntarily; and seven agreements covering various coal
                            and steel products have been revised to conform with the Treaty’s
                            antitrust provisions either voluntarily or upon intervention by the High
                            Authority. Relatively more important problems in this field, however,
                            are now under consideration by the High Authority. The High Authority’s
                            anti-cartel program is being put to a major, perhaps even crucial, test
                            in connection with the reorganization of the Ruhr and other coal
                            cartels. Many complicated economic and social factors must be taken into
                            account in dealing with this problem. Latest reports indicate that the
                            negotiations between the High Authority and Ruhr coal group concerning
                            its reorganization are nearing a conclusion. If the coal cartel obstacle
                            is successfully surmounted, the High <pb n="342" xml:id="pg_342"
                                facs="0370"/>Authority considers that it must come to grips with the
                            problem of competition in the steel industry where the existence of
                            agreements on prices has been suspected since the common market was
                            established in 1953. So far there is every indication that the High
                            Authority is pushing firmly ahead in its efforts to solve these
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>With regard to concentrations and mergers, the High Authority has had
                            under consideration 14 cases and has authorized 7 on the grounds that
                            they would not adversely affect competition in a substantial part of the
                                <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>. The remaining 7 cases are under
                            study. Although there has been a trend in the <gloss target="#t_CSC1"
                                >CSC</gloss> member States in recent years toward greater
                            concentration in the steel industry, this does not appear to be a
                            problem at this time. Out of a total of 250 steel enterprises in the
                                <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>, the total production of the
                            three largest amounted to only 13 percent of the 1954 production of the
                                <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> area. By way of comparison, the
                            largest U.S. steel firm produces approximately one-third of the total
                            U.S. production.</p>

                        <p>All of the $100 million U.S. loan had by May 1955 been allocated by the
                            High Authority to specific projects aimed at modernizing and expanding
                            production of raw materials and the construction at mines of power
                            plants utilizing low-grade coal. (Loans for establishing or modernizing
                            steel production facilities were excluded under the terms of the U.S.
                            loan agreement.) None of the 59 enterprises which has received a loan is
                            known to be engaged in restrictive practices in violation of a decision
                            of the High Authority under Article 65 prohibiting such practices. A
                            number of the loan recipients, almost all of them in the coal industry,
                            are, however, participating in business arrangements which are under
                            investigation by the High Authority or in which modifications are being
                            proposed because of <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0371"/>their
                            alleged restrictive character. Arrangements of the type in question are
                            of long standing in the European coal industry, preceding the
                            establishment of the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>; embrace all or
                            nearly all of the coal producing or marketing enterprises of the
                            countries concerned; and were generally either sponsored or approved by
                            the national governments. As noted before, no quick or easy solution has
                            been found so far for the coal cartel problems because of the
                            complicated economic and social factors which have to be dealt with in
                            Europe, as in other coal producing countries. If the High Authority had
                            made no loans to firms believed to be involved in restrictive
                            arrangements pending the outcome of its investigations or efforts to
                            modify broadly the structure of coal marketing in the <gloss
                                target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> area, coal companies would have been
                            eliminated from consideration as loan recipients, since the loan had to
                            be drawn by June 30, 1955. As a practical matter this would have meant
                            that the lending operation of the High Authority under the U.S. loan
                            would have been frustrated—with a consequent loss of important benefits
                            to the European economy from increased production and lowered costs as
                            well as the political benefits envisaged from the loan through
                            strengthening the position of the High Authority and encouraging
                            European integration. The High Authority did not consider it feasible to
                            use the granting or withholding of loans as an instrument for
                            influencing changes in business arrangements, and it is unlikely that by
                            withholding loans to the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> coal

                            were eliminated when the common market was established. Although not

                                efforts.</note> He also pointed to difficulties presented by
                            Brussels proposals because of their complexity and the length of the

                            about depriving private companies of patent rights was a serious
                            objection. He spoke at some length about German attitude towards French
                            desire to push European cooperation in the field of atomic energy as
                            contrasted with French attitude towards <gloss target="#t_EDC1"

                            the last years. I gathered he felt his government and Germans in general
                            resented eagerness of French to cooperate in this field as contrasted
                            with their delaying tactics in <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss> and
                            other efforts European cooperation. He set forth his own views as to the
                            desirability of working towards a European political assembly with
                            representatives elected by the people of all the six nations, this
                            assembly to create a community with definite but restricted powers,
                            starting with reduction tariffs and agreement for freedom of movement of

                        <p>He said that if such a truly European supranational community were
                            created, the Germans would be ready to give to it powers in the field of

                        <p>He implied that, though they would explore <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                                >OEEC</gloss> and Brussels approaches to atomic cooperation, they

                            unless there was some evidence of French desire to move towards bigger

                        <p>In discussion of the atomic energy problem in general and the forthcoming
                            legislation from Bundestag, I pointed to misunderstandings that seem to
                            exist in certain German industrial circles in regard to the special
                            nature of atomic energy. I pointed out that the reprocessing of fuel
                            elements was a necessary part of the production of atomic energy and
                            this reprocessing produced plutonium which is an atomic explosive. I
                            further pointed out our treaty with Belgium required <pb n="346"
                                xml:id="pg_346" facs="0374"/>this reprocessing to be done by the US
                            emphasizing our belief in the importance of the control of such highly
                            dangerous material. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>
                            indicated he would be glad to have me see Erhard, which I propose to do
                            next week, in view of Economic Ministry’s key role in Brussels
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>While <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> was aware of the
                            basic facts and their significance, there is evidence that Erhard’s
                            Ministry and some German industrialists are playing down the fact that
                            atomic explosive material is produced as a consequence of production of
                            atomic energy for peaceful purposes and are saying that there is no need
                            for more control of this industry than of electricity. Furthermore,
                            judging from conversations with certain industrialists here, believe
                            there is some misunderstanding in industrial circles as to likelihood of
                            early conclusion between <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>
                            Government and US Government of bilateral treaty for power reactors
                            along the lines of Belgian treaty. If in fact this prospect is as
                            distant as I assume it would be helpful to the case for a European
                            approach if this misunderstanding could be eliminated when I see Erhard.
                            I am not referring to standard bilateral for experimental reactor which
                            I assume can go forward without trouble.<note n="7" xml:id="d127fn7">In

                        <p>I think I fully understood the distinction to which you draw attention
                            between cooperation and integration, well made in this message, though I
                            do not understand its application in this connection. The message does
                            not refer to choice by Europeans in pursuing “integration” or
                            “cooperation” but “of institutional means” which I would assume includes
                            freedom to choose whether to do any particular thing by integrated or
                            cooperative arrangements. I am glad this still is the policy line though
                            it leaves us still at a loss to understand policy behind our strong

                            Brussels Steering Group meeting.</p>
                        <p>To come back to the distinction which of course has political importance
                            to us as far as our preferences are concerned, though we would not, I
                            gather, intervene. I have the feeling that as things are now developing,
                            it may be difficult, so far as Brussels is concerned, to make this
                            distinction in a way which will be clear to everyone concerned. In fact,
                            discussing this question Friday night with Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGD1">Dillon</persName>, he expressed very strongly the
                            view that what will come out of the Brussels meetings would be
                            considered integration by some and cooperation by others and it would
                            probably be impossible to be sure which it really was most. I think this
                            is probably right unless there is a major shift in direction there.</p>
                        <p>In this connection you may be interested in comments made by Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>, who dropped in for a
                            very pleasant visit last week. He had spent the weekend at a wine
                            tasting festival with <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>, and
                            while in Paris had seen quite a lot of <persName corresp="#p_MJ1"
                                >Monnet</persName>, of course. He asked both of them whether the
                            present US policy of lying low on European integration and saying and
                            doing nothing except as asked was sound, or whether we should become
                            more active. He reported that the reaction of both of them was most
                            emphatic that we should continue to stay entirely in the background.</p>
                        <p>He also reported that <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> hoped
                            to have a meeting of his committee before the end of this month. His
                            present plan was to attempt to get them to endorse a piece of
                            legislation providing for a really supranational nuclear authority which
                            they would then take back and have passed in substantially identical
                            form in their various parliaments. In particular, he anticipated this
                            would solve the German problem as there could be no opposition in the
                            Bundestag to the proposal, for <persName corresp="#p_AK1"

                            think we both felt that this was a rather typical example of <persName

                        <p>I might add that <persName corresp="#p_TJW1">Tuthill</persName> indicated
                            that the principal problem in Germany seemed to be lack of knowledge of
                            what was involved in the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes,
                            particularly in terms of its military consequences. Until <persName

                        <p>At the 267th meeting of the National Security Council, held at Camp
                                <persName>David, Maryland</persName>, on November 21, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> gave a lengthy report
                            to the Council on his recent activities at the Geneva Foreign Ministers
                            Conference. During <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>’
                            report, President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> made
                            the following remarks regarding Western European integration: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“After a brief pause, the President said that he had a few
                                    remarks to make on the subject of Western Europe. Smilingly he
                                    said that all the members of the Council realized that this area
                                    was one of his pets. Moreover, nearly all those present around
                                    this table had been engaged in work with large human
                                    organizations. Accordingly all knew the great value to be
                                    attached to the morale factor in large organizations. It was by
                                    working with the group that the individual achieved his greatest
                                    satisfaction and success. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"

                                        facs="0377"/>just touched on <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                        >NATO</gloss> as an organization which U.S. policy should
                                    support harder than ever in view of the fact Germany was not
                                    likely to be united for some time to come. Actually, said the
                                    President, the Secretary of State really underestimated the case
                                    he had made. The unity of Western Europe today, continued the
                                    President, would solve the peace of the world. A solid power
                                    mass in Western Europe would ultimately attract to it all the
                                    Soviet satellites, and the threat to peace would disappear.</p>
                                <p>“Continuing in this vein, the President said that there was one
                                    thing that all of those present could do as individuals to
                                    forward the objective he had just mentioned. Whenever occasion
                                    arose for any member of the National Security Council to talk in
                                    public about foreign policy, that talk should stress the great
                                    advantages of a more nearly united Europe—cultural, economic,
                                    moral, and otherwise. The President referred to his own speech,
                                    made on July 3, 1951, at the English Speaking Union in London,
                                    on the general subject of a United States of Europe. After that
                                    speech, the President said, he had gotten the warmest
                                    compliments of no less a person than Winston Churchill, who said
                                    that the speech, from the point of view of logic, was the best
                                    speech which had been delivered in this generation.</p>
                                <p>“At this point, with even greater emphasis the President repeated
                                    his view on the desirability of developing in Western Europe a
                                    third great power bloc, after which development the United
                                    States would be permitted to sit back and relax somewhat. To
                                    help to produce such a development it must be demonstrated to
                                    all the countries of Western Europe individually that each and
                                    every one would profit by the union of them all and that none
                                    would lose. The President cited the development of the American
                                    historical pattern as an illustration of the point he was
                                    making.” (Memorandum of discussion by <persName

                        <p>At the present time, as I understand it, a considerable controversy is
                            developing over the future of atomic energy for peaceful uses in Europe.
                            There is one school of thought which wants to develop this <pb n="350"
                                xml:id="pg_350" facs="0378"/>through a European institution
                            comparable to the Coal and Steel Community. There are others who want to
                            deal with it on a national governmental basis, and some who want to deal
                            with it on a private basis.</p>
                        <p>I have the impression that there exists no clear top policy guidance for
                            those who are working on this matter, both in the Department and in the
                                <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>I think we should reach a decision on which the President should be
                            consulted and then that we should be sure that that is carried out.</p>
                        <p>I wonder whether you can bring the threads together so that we know where
                            we are. I believe that the U.S.-Belgian agreement is rather far
                            advanced, but also I think the Belgian Government, or at least <persName

                            with the common market of the six Messina countries. The Government had,
                            therefore, made the decision not to join. They would communicate this
                            decision to the Messina governments in due course at a time chosen by
                            the British Government. Meanwhile, we were asked to hold this
                            information to ourselves. The subject was, however, also being discussed
                            with the Bonn Government.</p>
                        <p>The enterprise seemed, he said, to have an air of unreality since the
                            real French position seemed very questionable. There was no question of
                            the convictions of people like <persName corresp="#p_SPH1"
                                >Spaak</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName>,
                            but the Ambassador doubted very much whether, when the chips were down,
                            the French would be prepared to make the internal adjustments which
                            would be necessary for progress toward a common market.</p>
                        <p>More importantly, the British were concerned with the protectionist and
                            exclusive consequences of the six countries trying to move toward a
                            common market. The British recognized the political advantages of
                            integration but the inevitable economic effects would seem to them to go
                            contrary to our broader trade objectives as embodied, for example in
                                <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. They wondered if we had
                            thought through this aspect of the question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said we felt very
                            strongly that progress toward further integration was more important now
                            than ever and that we hoped the Messina group would form a basis for
                            such progress. We also thought that the peaceful uses of atomic energy
                            might be the most practical immediate means of moving along this line.
                            We would discuss the question further with interested officers in the
                            Department, particularly in the economic area. The Ambassador asked if
                            he could talk to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>
                            again when this had been done.</p>
                        <p>On <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>, again, the British
                            wondered whether the Messina group or <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                                >OEEC</gloss> was the preferable channel through which to develop
                            the idea. The Ambassador referred to <persName corresp="#p_CJE1"
                                >Coulson</persName>’s talk with <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Gerard
                                Smith</persName> on November 17 and said it was important for the
                            British and ourselves to keep in step, particularly as to what would be
                            our response if, as seemed likely, a group of continental countries
                            asked for assistance in the construction of a diffusion plant.</p>

                        <p>I have had an opportunity today to study the memorandum to the Council on
                            Foreign Economic Policy, dated November 15,<note n="2" xml:id="d132fn2"
                                >Reference is to <ref target="#d126">Document 126</ref>.</note>
                            which deals with United States policy toward the European Coal and Steel
                            Community, and hope it will not be inappropriate for me to make some
                            comments.</p>
                        <p>From the very inception of the Schuman Plan, the questions covered by
                            this memorandum have been of absorbing interest to me, and I have tried
                            to follow them closely.</p>
                        <p>I see them from two points of view: first, in terms of my Government
                            responsibility, and secondly, as a member of the American steel
                            industry.</p>
                        <p>Actually, the American industry as such is singularly ignorant of this
                            subject matter and displays little interest in it. Except for myself, I
                            know of no one who follows these problems continuously, although there
                            are signs that this may change.</p>
                        <p>And because of the personal relationships which I have both in Government
                            and in industry in all of the countries that are involved, I receive
                            from time to time many sidelights on the problems.</p>
                        <p>May I say, first of all, that the memorandum is admirable, in my opinion.
                            It was prepared thoughtfully, and with meticulous care. Factually, I am
                            sure it is correct as seen by our Government staff. But genuine
                            competition is such a fragile plant that its growth cannot be judged
                            merely by laboratory examination of the soil.</p>
                        <p>Actually, the men who are responsible for the administration of the steel
                            companies in these six countries still have a low order of enthusiasm
                            for competition, and are privately doing what they can to maintain
                            cartel practices.</p>
                        <p>In the export field, they are quite brazen about it. It is their position
                            that the treaty did not cover exports, and control of export prices and
                            markets is still exercised out of Brussels in a way that is in conflict
                            with the spirit of the Community and that of our American laws. Export
                            control, thus operated, necessarily establishes a high degree of control
                            over domestic prices, without there being any overt acts of
                            agreement.</p>
                        <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353" facs="0381"/>
                        <p>And let no one think that the cartel principle has been eliminated from
                            the purchase of scrap. Actually, recent pressures from the American
                            steel industry for export controls on scrap leaving this country were
                            brought to pass in large measure by the operation of the Community’s
                            intensive and centrally operated scrap-buying program. The man who
                            controls all of the scrap buying in this country for the Community is
                                <persName>Tony Rollman</persName> of Luxembourg, formerly of ARBED,
                            and formerly of <gloss target="#t_ECE1">ECE</gloss> in Geneva. The
                            agency in this country is Luria.</p>
                        <p>And at the very time when through these agencies the Community was
                            expressing dismay at the prospect of export controls from this country,
                            they were themselves strictly limiting the export of scrap from the
                            Community. It has for some time, for example, been impossible for any
                            scrap dealer in the Community to sell to other than member countries
                            scrap resulting from the breaking up of ships, which is a very desirable
                            commodity. How this was done, I do not know, but the result has been
                            obvious.</p>
                        <p>Contemporaneously, the imposition of price controls on scrap either by
                            direct action of the Community or with its acquiescence, inhibited the
                            collection of scrap, because the incentive was withdrawn. In this
                            country we regard it as essential that prices on scrap rise with an
                            increase in demand, for that brings self-interest to bear upon
                            increasing the supply.</p>
                        <p>The ambiguous relationship of Britain with the Community has only one
                            purpose, namely to be “constructive” with regard to markets. This will,
                            of course, not be found in the documents, nor will it be developed by
                            any legalistic approach to the subject. The British steel industry fears
                            the Community, and this relationship is an effort to achieve the
                            impossible, the preservation of freedom of action for Britain, while at
                            the same time tempering the force of competition.</p>
                        <p>I am tremendously interested in the suggestion that a United States
                            expert group be appointed to consult with the High Authority on the
                            comparative organization and operation of steel markets in the United
                            States and the Community. That group will have to be selected with great
                            care. It must consist of those who understand steel merchandising, and
                            yet must be made up of men who themselves believe firmly in the values
                            of competition.</p>
                        <p>One difficulty with the problem is that the steel industry of the
                            Community countries has never learned to sell as we do in the American
                            industry. They do not have many specialists who study the needs of the
                            consumer and secure business for the producer by outstripping
                            competitors in service tailored to the special requirements of the
                            consumer. They haven’t had to sell, because by their control of markets
                            through the central agencies the buyer had to take what he could get. It
                            has been common, for example, for the buyer <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354"
                                facs="0382"/>not to be certain from what mill shipment would come
                            until it reached his plant, thus restricting the close relationship of
                            producer and consumer upon which our merchandising programs rest.</p>
                        <p>When such an expert group is set up, I should guess that the technical
                            members could be secured by a request made by the State Department to
                            the American Iron and Steel Institute. I am sure that such a request
                            would receive friendly consideration by Mr.
                                <persName>Fairless</persName>, who is now president of the
                            Institute, and Mr. <persName>Max Howell</persName>, who is executive
                            vice president. Both of these men now have an interest in foreign
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>It is my understanding that in Europe the Community now falls within the
                            area of responsibility of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWW1"

                                    relation to European integration. I attach herewith a memorandum
                                    prepared in <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss> on this subject
                                    with which I am in agreement. I thought it might be useful if
                                    you ran over it before we talked and that we might also ask Bob

                        <p>The President has expressed the conviction that “European integration,
                            with West Germany playing a part, would be a major contribution to world
                            peace; that a unified Europe (achieved by strengthening and expanding
                            into other areas the concepts of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>,
                            the Brussels Pact, and the Coal and Steel Community) would constitute a
                            focus of power, in addition to the US and USSR, which would greatly
                            advance the material and moral well-being of European peoples and the
                            security interests of the United States.” We would elaborate this
                            thought by the observation that, despite present surface evidences of
                            recovery, boom, prosperity and growth in Western Europe, the USSR will,
                            by 1975, have overtaken Western Europe’s aggregate <gloss

                            decisions are made to increase its power and accelerate its growth. We
                            would also add that unless the United States and Western Europe develop
                            new resources, and implement <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0384"/>a
                            plan for making them available to underdeveloped parts of the world,
                            these areas may well look upon the Communist Bloc rather than the West
                            as example and prototype, and look to it for leadership and help, for
                            the growth and development processes they believe they must set in
                            motion. It is in the context of these potentialities and these dangers
                            that the form and purpose of European integration should be
                            considered.</p>
                        <p>Between defeat of the <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss> by the French
                            Assembly and the Meeting of the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>
                            Ministers at Messina in June, European leadership of the integration
                            movement was quiescent. Very widely in France, but not only there,
                            “supranationalism” became political anathema. Under <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>’s leadership in Brussels,
                            representatives of the Community of Six governments are now studying
                            possibilities for new initiatives in the field of European integration
                            with its most significant work focusing on atomic energy. Apart from
                            this, <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> has organized a
                            political action group dedicated to the support of the concept of a
                            United Europe; it comprises, notably, the leadership of the socialist
                            parties in all of the six countries, including leaders previously
                            opposed to <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss>. The <gloss
                                target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> is, meanwhile, exploring new fields
                            of cooperative action, including the field of peaceful uses of atomic
                            energy.</p>
                        <p>The European leaders of the integration movement are recovering their
                            voices. On numerous occasions key leaders have advised us to give them
                            our moral support, but to let them, without overt U.S. intervention, set
                            their pace and work out their difficulties. That this has been their
                            plea has been, in a sense, providential: had they asked otherwise we
                            would not have known what to do. But for us to remain comfortably mute
                            for much longer presents ominous possibilities. For Germany, at least, a
                            failure of the present drive towards integration could remove all
                            restraints upon those special interests capable even now of exploiting
                            East-West tensions in a bold gamble to advance narrow German nationalist
                            purposes. Rampant and successful German nationalism could hardly fail to
                            breed predatory and competitive nationalism elsewhere in Western Europe,
                            from which only the Soviet Bloc could benefit. To forestall such a
                            disastrous, perhaps irreparable, setback to Free World strength and
                            unity, the United States should be prepared to respond promptly,
                            concretely, and favorably to an initiative coming out of Europe.</p>
                        <p>Discussion of European integration revolves around the concept of
                            peaceful uses of atomic energy. It is a magic, and only partially
                            understood, concept. But it is, we think, well understood that
                            integration in this field could, and probably would, set in motion
                            ancillary and concomitant developments which would lead, over time,
                            towards a real United States of Europe. It is also understood, at least
                            by the leading European participants in planning its use, that peaceful
                                <pb n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0385"/>uses of atomic energy
                            cannot, for technical reasons, be dissociated from potential possession
                            of atomic power for military purposes. European countries acknowledge
                            and respect generally the problem faced by the Atomic Energy Commission
                            in working out arrangements with other nations for sharing atomic energy
                            information and materials. They know that real and possibly catastrophic
                            security risks are entailed in improper handling of atomic knowledge and
                            materials. The German industrialists who, today, are pressing for the
                            establishment of a bilateral arrangement between the United States and
                            Germany must be doing so because they think that it would serve their
                            self-interested nationalist aspirations, that such a bilateral could be
                            concluded quickly, and that security difficulties could be easily
                            overcome; this would be an understandable position for industrialists to
                            take in every European country. It would become immediately untenable if
                            it could be made known that the United States was ready to participate
                            in arrangements involving the United States on one side and a group of
                            integrated countries on the other and that this relationship would best
                            serve the interests of all from every standpoint including security.</p>
                        <p>The very rapid advances in declassification of information on atomic
                            energy which have taken place in particular since the August Conference
                            in Geneva has come to mean that the United States no longer occupies the
                            monopolistic position it once held. Of the various forms of cooperation
                            available to the United States—educational exchanges, provisions of
                            libraries, financing of research reactors, and even supply of know-how
                            and materials needed for operation of power reactors—it is improbable
                            that any except cooperation in the erection of isotopic separation
                            facilities for uranium could, today, constitute a United States
                            initiative which would fundamentally influence the form and purpose of
                            European development in the atomic energy field. Europeans believe that
                            there is the scientific knowledge and there are the resources in Europe
                            for Europeans themselves to have reached within a few years, and
                            unassisted, the stage in atomic energy development where the United
                            States and the USSR now stand today. Advocates of European integration
                            maintain that, if unified, Europe’s rate of progress will be very rapid,
                            but even if European nations make their advances separately and on a
                            national basis, they will, in due course, possess all of the “secrets”,
                            military and peaceful, of atomic energy.<note n="4" xml:id="d133fn4">The

                            supranational organization of atomic energy programs in Europe, but it
                            has not said it would refuse to enter into negotiation of bilateral

                            October were we even able to say, authoritatively and with support of
                            the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>, that we could treat a pool of
                            European countries on roughly the same basis that we could treat a
                            single country. Our second difficulty has been lack of precise agreement
                            within the State Department, and among our representatives in Missions
                            abroad, as to what could be conceived as the most promising and
                            realistic form of integration we had in mind when talking about that
                            word. Not until last May had we made it clear that by integration we
                            meant supranational authority and responsibility, and that arrangements
                            less binding were merely cooperative. Even after this distinction was
                            drawn and accepted, however, there has been no agreement that in
                            practical political terms there was sufficient promise in real
                            accessions of authority and responsibility to the Coal and Steel
                            Community of Six to justify according to this Community greater
                            attention and support than to the geographically broader, functionally
                            more diversified, but legally and politically looser association of
                            countries in the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>. At our Paris
                            meeting on September 22, vigorous differences of judgment on this

                        <p>The magnitude of the difficulties and the opportunities which confront us
                            as we consider the possible role the United States might play in using
                            its atomic energy resources to assist in European integration suggest
                            several conclusions. We cannot, ourselves, materially contribute to
                            objectives we desire by words alone. Perhaps no single factor so greatly
                            contributed to acceptance of the Western European Union as the United
                            Kingdom’s troop commitment. This was an unprecedented and real change in
                            the United Kingdom’s relationship to Western Europe, conceptually and
                            practically. This action—as no <pb n="359" xml:id="pg_359" facs="0387"
                            />amount of moral encouragement or philosophical explanation could have
                            done—made possible a change in Franco-German relations. A second
                            conclusion is that it is almost inconceivable that the United States can
                            contribute to a comparably revivifying action by Europeans without
                            itself reaching comparably far reaching decisions. Our action must be
                            one which would require overcoming the anxieties of the Congress and
                            preconceptions, uncertainties, and irresolution within the
                            Administrative Branch. If European integration is in the interest of
                            Free World strength, unity and security, and if we want to influence its
                            accomplishment, we must expect our leadership to be measured by the
                            difficulties we face, and these must be seen to be as sensitive and as
                            fundamental as those faced by European leaders urging their peoples to
                            sacrifice national integrity and self-determination for a common goal
                            and good. Our act of faith must match theirs.</p>

                                of European atomic energy integration. The U.S. action must be
                                technically and economically sound if we are to capitalize fully on
                                the present opportunity. I suggest that we proceed immediately, with
                                    <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> technical advice, to
                                determine just what action will be most effective. Here are a few

                                well have the most political appeal of any offer we could make. At
                                the same time, it is not entirely clear to me that it would be the
                                most economic move for the Europeans, even assuming substantial U.S.
                                financing. Enriched uranium from the very large U.S. plants whose
                                costs are being amortized over the life of weapons programs should
                                be much cheaper—unless the <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss>

                                atomic energy. Moreover, such a plant would take years to build—with
                                some chance that at the end of that period, enriched uranium will be
                                less essential than now appears likely.</item>

                            collaboration in the field of nuclear energy.<note n="2"

                            This is a highly complicated subject with many technical aspects to
                            which we, as well as you, are giving attention. I hope our two staffs
                            keep in close touch on these aspects of the problem. I think it is
                            important that you and I try to align the policies of our two
                            Governments as closely as possible with respect to the broad frameworks
                            within which current European initiatives in the atomic energy and other
                            fields are developing. It is on this wider problem which I would like to
                            tell you of our thinking.</p>
                        <p>In the light of the Geneva Conference, I am impressed with the necessity
                            of strengthening in every way possible the unity and purpose of the
                            West. I believe we can derive comfort from the fact that the Soviets
                            seem unlikely to resort to general war to achieve their objectives in
                            Europe. At the same time, we can expect no lessening of their political
                            and subversive offensive against Western Europe, as well as other areas.
                            Their tactics will inevitably be to try to divide us and, through
                            so-called “peaceful competition” to step up the battle for men’s minds.
                            I am confident of our ability to compete on any basis with the Soviet
                            system. Our ability to do so, however, will depend upon the degree to
                            which we are successful in preserving our unity and strength.</p>
                        <p>There is also the related question of Germany. I have no doubt about the
                            present devotion of the <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>
                            Government to full cooperation with the West. There is, however, the
                            danger that the appeal of reunification will, over a period of time,
                            become so strong <pb n="363" xml:id="pg_363" facs="0391"/>in Germany as
                            to give rise to temptation to discard the associations with the West in
                            an effort to advance reunification on terms which would at best result
                            in a neutral Germany and at worst in an Eastern-oriented Germany. Our
                            problem is to prevent this possibility arising. The best means of doing
                            this, in my judgment, is to so tie Germany into the whole complex of
                            Western institutions—military, political and economic—and to so command
                            her loyalties that neutrality or orientation to the East will be
                            commonly accepted as unthinkable. This is a large order, I know, but I
                            see no other alternative.</p>
                        <p>The form that European unity takes is, of course, for the Europeans
                            themselves to decide. We should not prescribe. Anything other than
                            objective advice and cooperation could well be self-defeating. Europe
                            can only unite effectively if it sees the advantages of uniting and
                            wants to unite. Only in such a development can the required strength be
                            built.</p>
                        <p>At present, there are two trends discernible in Europe, both directed
                            toward goals of increased unity. One is the six-nation approach, which
                            has had one signal success in the Coal and Steel Community and one
                            signal defeat in the European Defense Community. This, as we know, is
                            essentially a supranational approach. The other is the <gloss
                                target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> approach, a cooperative effort which
                            has accomplished much in reconciling conflicting national interests. The
                            United States Government has enthusiastically supported both of these
                            concepts. In my opinion, they seek to accomplish different but not
                            conflicting purposes. As we look toward the future it seems to me that
                            the closer community of interests that Europe can build, the more hope
                            Europe will have of realizing its potential for security, prosperity and
                            influence in world affairs. To my mind, the six-nation grouping approach
                            gives the greatest hope of achieving this end because of the closer
                            unity which is inherent in that Community and because of the
                            contribution which it will make to the strength and cohesion of the
                            wider European grouping. It may well be that a six-nation community will
                            evolve protectionist tendencies. It may be that it will show a trend
                            toward greater independence. In the long-run, however, I cannot but feel
                            that the resultant increased unity would bring in its wake greater
                            responsibility and devotion to the common welfare of Western Europe.</p>
                        <p>It is for these reasons, and with the companion determination to continue
                            to cooperate with the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>, that the
                            President and I have been anxious to encourage in every appropriate way
                            the current revival of initiative by the six nations in their search for
                            new forms of integration in the fields of nuclear and conventional
                            energy, a common market and transportation. We hope that progress will
                            be swift, but we should be satisfied if there is sustained and real
                            advance <pb n="364" xml:id="pg_364" facs="0392"/>toward the practical
                            ideal inherent in the supranational principle.</p>
                        <p>I hope that you will let me have your reaction to these views on this
                            matter and that we can count upon your Government’s support. I hope to
                            discuss this matter with you at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                        <p><persName>Baron van Voorst</persName>, who called to discuss European
                            integration problems, mentioned a story by Reston in the <hi

                                facs="0393"/>days ago, and a subsequent story in today’s <hi
                                rend="italic">Times</hi> by Schmidt, indicating that the Secretary
                            plans to make a statement at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            meeting about European integration, particularly in the field of atomic
                                energy.<note n="2" xml:id="d136fn2">For the former story, see <hi
                                    rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, December 6, 1955, p. 1; for

                                1.</note> He reported that Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_BBJW1">Beyen</persName> is somewhat concerned about the
                            report in the Reston story. They feel that U.S. support through
                            diplomatic channels is more than welcome and has been extremely
                            effective, for example, with the Germans regarding atomic energy.
                            However, they fear that public statements by the U.S. might be
                            counterproductive.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> assured the Minister
                            that the Reston story was not inspired by the Department, that we
                            continue to have an active interest in European integration, and that we
                            fully realize that the initiative must lie in Western Europe. He said
                            the Secretary does not plan to make a statement on this subject although
                            he expects it to come up in his private conversations with the various
                            Foreign Ministers in Paris.</p>
                        <p><persName>Baron van Voorst</persName> then remarked that the British had
                            discussed European integration problems with the Foreign Office in The
                            Hague recently and the Dutch were surprised to find that the British are
                            taking a more reserved line now. He remarked that it was probably too
                            early to know, but it might be that our diplomatic support in London
                            would be useful in this connection also. He asked whether it was
                            expected that this subject would come up during Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s visit here<note n="3"

                                3-day official visit, January 30–February 1.</note> or whether the
                            discussions would be more general. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1"
                                >Merchant</persName> said that no definite plans for the discussions
                            with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> have yet been made,
                            but he assumed that, since his visit would be short, they would consist
                            largely of a general tour d’horizon.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> opened the conversation with
                            a brief review of the status of his Committee for European integration.
                            He said that the Committee would meet the middle of January to consider
                            a resolution on an Atomic Energy Commission similar to the Coal and
                            Steel Community. With energetic effort, he thought it might be possible
                            to have a treaty adopted during the next year.</p>
                        <p>Several serious obstacles would have to be overcome, however. The first
                            was in Germany. There the Chancellor, the unions and the <gloss
                                target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> all supported the idea, but the German
                            industrialists are opposing it, preferring to go their own way.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brentano</persName> is fine on the issue
                                <pb n="368" xml:id="pg_368" facs="0396"/>and would like the U.S. to
                            be more firm. The U.S. must indicate that it prefers to proceed on the
                            basis of unity instead of bilaterally and could do more for Europe on
                            that basis. The Chancellor needs some basis for overruling the
                            objections of the German industrialists and would welcome such an
                            attitude.</p>
                        <p>The second problem is the British. They are actively engaged in trying to
                            discourage further progress toward integration. Their main target has
                            been the common market. Those favoring integration recognize that this
                            will take years, perhaps ten years, to achieve. The <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> Committee seeks action now on the
                            atomic matter in the belief that if added to the Coal and Steel
                            Community that would revive the integration movement. Then progress
                            could be made toward the common market. The aim is not to socialize
                            atomic industry. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> hoped that
                            the Secretary would be able to speak to the British about integration at
                            the time of <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s visit.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said there were some questions under U.S. law about how far
                            the U.S. could go in cooperating with a European agency. He said,
                            however, that he would give a boost as best he could in his conversation
                            with <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brentano</persName>.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d138fn2"><persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> met

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> expressed the view that
                            Europe was really at a more crucial crossroad than at any recent time.
                            In the pending French elections, <persName corresp="#p_MG2"
                                >Mollet</persName> was largely responsible for staving off a Popular
                            Front by refusing to join with the Communists for election purposes.
                            This will not be possible in the future years if some progress is not
                            made toward European integration. Unless this occurs, we can expect to
                            see the gradual disintegration of Europe. The German labor unions now
                            recognize this and have told <persName corresp="#p_MJ1"
                                >Monnet</persName> they would fully support any resolution on the
                            Atomic Energy Community. <persName corresp="#p_OE1"
                                >Ollenhauer</persName> is anxious to go along. German labor
                            considers that European integration is the only way to keep their
                            liberties for the future. The only German opposition comes from Erhardt
                            and the industrialists.</p>
                        <p>As the conversation ended, the Secretary again said that he would do what
                            he could with Germans and British and that the U.S. would cooperate in
                            trying to assist in the creation of the European atomic agency.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> began by stressing his view
                            that German question by no means ended at Geneva. He said he detected an
                            attitude on part French to consider with some relief that since German
                            reunification seems impossible in immediate future, matter is
                            “finished.” Secretary agreed that while French might prefer divided
                            Germany, this attitude unrealistic. He handed <persName

                            />Secretary said both fronts equally important and must not fail on
                            either. Would be most dangerous if Germans had nothing to occupy their
                            minds in the inevitable period of waiting that lies ahead on
                            reunification question. They might then look to Soviets. Necessary

                            over British attitude toward European integration. Said British have
                            launched what can only be termed “strong offensive” against common
                            market concept. Secretary said he had talked on subject to <persName

                                    that portion of the conversation pertaining to European
                                    integration went as follows:</p>
                                <p>“<persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said that
                                    various <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> nations look with
                                    some alarm on proposal for ‘tight’ integration of Community of
                                    Six as implying high tariffs and other protective measures. He
                                    felt that creation of such Common Market community would create
                                    a source of division rather than of strength. <gloss
                                        target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> Government desires freer
                                    movement of money and goods in Europe and felt that European
                                    integration scheme would produce the reverse. He said that
                                        <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> will ask that question of
                                    relationship of Community to <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                                        >OEEC</gloss> and its possible effects be discussed at next

                                    >OEEC</gloss>.</p>
                                <p>“Secretary said US favors European unity not high tariffs. He
                                    said that it is important to do something to capture the
                                    imagination of the Germans and European integration offers a
                                    means to this end. In field of atomic energy it seems
                                    particularly important to create agency in Europe in which
                                    French and Germans have common interest. He did not believe
                                    Community and <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> were
                                    mutually exclusive and felt there is adequate basis for both to
                                    develop. He said that President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                        >Eisenhower</persName> feels strongly on this subject and
                                    that Congress also favors community idea.</p>
                                <p>“<persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> explained that
                                    it was not intention of <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> to
                                    attack or undermine development of Community. He pointed out
                                    that in the past <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> had possibly
                                    waited too long to make clear its attitude, as in the case of

                                        <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> would not be
                                    unsympathetic to Community if product of integration were low
                                    rather than high tariff wall.” (Department of State, Central

                                >Spaak</persName> said that while perhaps French wish this, other
                            five countries clearly against such a development. <persName

                            agreement on formula and therefore no basis for British condemning idea
                            in advance.</p>
                        <p>Secretary spoke of deep sympathy and interest President <persName

                            closer European integration, and referred to President’s view that if
                            Britian had given strong support to <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss>
                            at an earlier time, <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss> would have been
                            success. British support came to late. Indicated that integration
                            question would undoubtedly be discussed with <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName> during January visit. We don’t want to see British

                        <p>Secretary assured <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> he could
                            count on President and himself to support and work hard in appropriate
                            ways for European integration. <pb n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0399"

                            foresight these matters. They are not thinking of what situation in
                            Germany could be five years hence if present opportunities are
                            missed.</p>
                        <p>Turning to specific question proposed nuclear energy pool, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> said German Delegation hesitant
                            at Brussels discussions. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>
                            had assured <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> during latter’s
                            visit to Bonn, that he would give strong instructions “along the right
                            lines” to <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> on this matter.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> emphasized great
                            advantages multilateral approach to nuclear energy question over
                            bilateral, and hoped that US would indicate to Germans that latter would
                            get greater benefits on multilateral basis than on bilateral. Secretary
                            said he was seeing <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName>
                            later in day and intended talk to him on this subject.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> said Brussels work had made
                            real progress. Hopes have his report prepared by end January. Foresees
                            difficult negotiations then beginning. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1"
                                >Spaak</persName> made point that British offensive has been
                            launched precisely because they believe Brussels initiatives have real
                            chance succeed. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> added that
                            British have put common market question on <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                                >OEEC</gloss> agenda. It is too early for it to be usefully
                            discussed. Later, <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> said, he
                            will be more than ready discuss effects of proposal with countries
                            outside Brussels group.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> spoke feelingly of
                            overriding political importance tying Germany firmly into west. Reverted
                            to failure Britain realize this. Greatly disturbed by fact that current
                            “very strong” British opposition is first time they have so declared
                            themselves. Secretary noted that British worried over their financial
                            situation. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> commented that
                            British position amounts to this—they say that common market
                            discriminates against them but when asked to join in, British answer is
                            no, pleading commonwealth ties and preference arrangements.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> then summarized basic
                            problem in terms very similar to Secretary’s earlier analysis. He put
                            particular emphasis that Germans must be given hope, otherwise will talk
                            to Soviets. Indicated he feared that French, like British, are failing
                            understand problem, although <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName>
                            personally has been very sound. Secretary agreed, and added that
                            cooperation among Western Ministers at Geneva Foreign Ministers meeting
                            was best he had ever experienced.</p>

                            Federal Government’s views on atomic energy pool. He said he and
                            President were hopeful that six-power project would be worked out. He
                            said that degree of cooperation from US would be greater on basis of
                            community approach than on basis of individual effort. Said he had made
                            this point to <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> earlier in

                            for six-power community approach. He felt certain there would be
                            disposition in both executive and legislative branches of US Government
                            to be more favorable to six-power group than on bilateral basis. He also
                            felt that community approach would help solve problem of controls of
                            materials of weapon quality produced in process of producing energy.
                            Expressed hope that Federal Government would move in this direction,
                            noting that there is apparently some difference of opinion on this
                            subject Germany and opposition in industrial circles.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brentano</persName> said that Federal
                            Government fully supported Messina program, particularly community
                            approach to atomic energy. British opposition to community approach had
                            created real difficulty in Germany, since it gave opponents additional
                            arguments. He had spoken to <persName corresp="#p_MH1"
                                >Macmillan</persName> about this and said matter would be discussed
                            in <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss>. He was personally convinced that
                            some institution, not necessarily supranational in character, was needed
                            to deal with atomic energy problem and was convinced that <gloss
                                target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> could not provide necessary basis. He
                            also said that he did not think <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>
                            could provide closer integration among six nations. He asked whether US
                            could not indicate its support for six-nation approach and fact that it
                            did not support other programs. Secretary said that he doubted whether
                            US could go that far. While it could not exert pressure, it could use
                            its influence. He informed <persName corresp="#p_BH1"

                                a means of eliminating restrictive practices. The loan was largely
                                limited by its terms to coal companies which were engaged in
                                practices <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0402"/>similar to the

                                decided that no action should be taken against these companies until

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CL1">Couillard</persName> indicated that the
                            purpose of his visit was to learn the United States views regarding the
                            proposal of the six European countries for the establishment of a common
                            market. He was not coming on instructions of his government, but he had
                            seen reports in the press indicating U.S. “support” for European
                            integration and he wondered what the extent of that “support” might be.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CL1">Couillard</persName> went on to point out
                            that the Canadian Government had not taken any formal position on the
                            possible establishment of a common <pb n="375" xml:id="pg_375"
                                facs="0403"/>market by France, the Federal Republic of Germany,
                            Belgium, Luxembourg, and Italy. However, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PLB1"
                                >Pearson</persName>, Canadian Minister of External Affairs, had
                            indicated last week at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting
                            Canadian sympathy with the objectives of the six continental governments
                            insofar as they would contribute to European political stability. He had
                            also expressed, however, the traditional Canadian doubts based on
                            commercial and political considerations regarding the possibility of
                            European integration actually taking place. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CL1">Couillard</persName> recalled the Canadian
                            misgivings regarding preferential trading arrangements and indicated
                            that while Canada would welcome a rapprochement between France and
                            Germany, its initial reaction to the suggestion for the establishment of
                            a European common market was that the project could prove to be more of
                            a divisive force in Europe rather than source of unity, particularly in

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Frank</persName> asked why the Canadians thought this might
                            be the case. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CL1">Couillard</persName> replied
                            that Canada would welcome European economic integration if it could be
                            achieved overnight. However, the practical problems associated with
                            achieving it and the long delay envisaged for their solution could only
                            result in an increase in the frictions and difficulties between the six
                            governments concerned, and between those six and the countries outside
                            the integration movement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Frank</persName> stated that the United States shared the
                            concern of Canada regarding preferential arrangements in international
                            trade, and the level of the common tariff of the six countries, of
                            course, would be of very great interest to this government. The United
                            States also shared the British interest in preserving and increasing the
                            progress made by such institutions as the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                                >OEEC</gloss> in the removal of quantitative restrictions on trade.
                            Moreover, its general commercial policy continued to be based on a
                            belief in the benefit of the multilateral as against the regional
                            approach to international trade problems. On the other hand, he saw no
                            reason at this time to be concerned over the common market tariff or
                            arrangements by the six countries with respect to quantitative
                            restrictions on trade. No concrete proposals had been formulated
                            regarding either problem. Consequently, there was really no evidence as
                            yet that the objectives of the six countries and those of the <gloss
                                target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> were fundamentally incompatible.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRW1">Barnett</persName> noted that European
                            integration was an objective which the United States wished to support
                            in view of the contribution it might make to a solution of the
                            Franco-German political problem which had been aggravated by the outcome
                            of the recent Geneva Conference. Furthermore, supranational institutions
                            would be the surest way of associating Germany with Western Europe. In
                            this U.S. approach other problems including the admittedly serious
                            commercial <pb n="376" xml:id="pg_376" facs="0404"/>ones which might
                            arise as a result of the development of the common market, were
                            necessarily subordinate. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRW1"
                                >Barnett</persName> went on to point out that the United States in
                            favoring integration by the six countries was not at this stage making
                            any judgment regarding the means that had been outlined, for example in
                            the working group report on the common market, for its achievement. The
                            six governments directly concerned had not yet developed concrete plans
                            for the integration of their economies. Until they did the United States
                            would maintain its support of European integration as a highly desirable
                            objective while at the same time reserving its right to judge on their
                            merits any specific means suggested for the attainment of that
                            objective. In the consideration of any approaches that may eventually be
                            formulated by the six governments, he felt sure the United States would
                            view with very considerable concern the possible development of a
                            protectionist bloc in Europe.</p>
                        <p>There was some discussion at this point in the light of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> experience of some possible
                            safeguards against the development of excessive protectionism in
                            regional groupings.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CL1">Couillard</persName> stated that one
                            problem the Canadians had with the integration concept was the notion
                            that it would “tie” Germany to the West. In the Canadian view, the
                            effect of integration might well be to make Germany the dominant power
                            in any group of countries forming a common market. He personally
                            believed that concern on this point underlay the French reluctance to
                            embark on European integration projects. In concluding, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CL1">Couillard</persName> asked whether it would be
                            correct to summarize the U.S. position on European integration as
                            follows: (1) the United States generally supports a closer integration
                            of Europe in view of the political advantages that might result
                            therefrom; (2) the United States would look at any specific proposals
                            for a common market in terms of the contribution which they would make
                            to the achievement of European integration; and (3) in reaching a
                            judgment on any such approach the United States would be influenced by
                            the international ecomonic obligations of the countries desiring to
                            integrate their economies. Mr. <persName>Frank</persName> and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BRW1">Barnett</persName> agreed that this was
                            a fair statement of the U.S. position on the matter at this time. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CL1">Couillard</persName> thanked them for
                            their assistance in making clear the United States thinking on the
                            subject.</p>

                            French or Italians. Only sensible tactics, he said, would have been

                        <p>As to US attitude, he is well aware of our support, but as is Eschauzier
                            (see last sentence my telegram 914, December 21<note n="5"

                                if it involved detriment to our basic interests in the atomic field.
                                I do not know enough about the subject to know whether it would or
                                not, but we should certainly take an awfully close look.” (<hi

                                    >Bowie</persName></hi>: It seems that the march of events since
                            the atomic meeting in Geneva is forcing the U.S. into making basic
                            atomic policy decisions which may be drastically different from those
                            under which we have hitherto been operating. At the time that Mr.
                                <persName>Acheson</persName> was Secretary,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d145fn2">Dean Acheson was Secretary of State from 1949 to
                                1953.</note> it was departmental working policy that atomic energy
                            coin should only be paid out in cases of atomic energy benefit, the
                            corollary being that the U.S. ought never to attempt to <pb n="379"
                                xml:id="pg_379" facs="0407"/>use the atom in any way to foster or
                            force non-atomic political results. I believe now that this policy
                            should be seriously rescrutinized, for it is clear that the U.S.
                            possesses at this moment a political weapon in atomic energy, the value
                            of which is currently at its maximum. It is too soon to prophesy how
                            quickly this coin will deteriorate in value, but it is quite certain
                            that if it is to be used as a basis for solving certain problems
                            immediately facing us, the basic decisions will surely have to be taken
                            very quickly. It goes without saying that in seeking what might be
                            called extra curricular political benefits by such means that we must be
                            extremely careful to safeguard basic U.S. interests in the atomic field
                            itself.</p>
                        <p>As I told you last Saturday, it seems clear that the present “atoms for
                            peace” plan, great and helpful as it is, is not well designed to answer
                            the atomic needs of Western Europe. Since I have been back from the U.S.
                            for several months, I cannot hope to include in this letter suggestions
                            on the problems now being raised which would in all cases be practical
                            solutions to the internal problems which these same questions raise at
                            home. It is necessary to content oneself then with presenting
                            suggestions which could help to satisfy the purely European needs and
                            leave to you the evaluation of such suggestions and the manner in which
                            they must be handled with our colleagues in the Department and the
                            Commission.</p>
                        <p>As a result of the President’s Penn State speech, it is clear that the
                            U.S. has promised atomic power aid to the world as a whole, in some
                            undefined manner.<note n="3" xml:id="d145fn3">For text of <persName
                                    corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s commencement address

                            The question arises therefore as to what form this aid should take in
                            Western Europe and whether or not this aid should be a mere donation or
                            whether we should not in fact extract non-atomic political benefits to
                            the U.S. as a price for its transfer. I am strongly of the opinion that
                            aid in the power field should be transferred only at a price, and would
                            now like to discuss the political problems and decisions which such a
                            policy would entail.</p>
                        <p>The first point which emerges of course is the fact that whatever policy
                            is chosen must of necessity solve the security problem raised by the
                            production of plutonium or uranium 233 in foreign power reactors. We
                            must be realistic about this point; it is clear that a fifth country,
                            namely France, will be in possession of substantial plutonium stocks
                            very shortly. In point of fact such stocks will begin to accrue to
                            France in quantity sufficient for weapons manufacture during the year
                            1957; her first production reactor will go into operation <hi
                                rend="italic">next week</hi>. If we do not, in the Immediate future,
                            come to some understanding with France regarding the disposition of this
                            plutonium <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0408"/>for peacetime uses,
                            we may assuredly expect that the French military and rightist groups
                            will demand access to at least part of these stocks for weapons use.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, in spite of the <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss> accords,
                            the presence of atomic weapons in the hands of France is bound to raise
                            problems vis-à-vis the Germans which would result in placing great if
                            not fatal strains on the present tenuous relationship. We therefore came
                            face to face immediately with the basic problem, that is the
                            Franco-German relationship. But before discussing this point in further
                            detail I should like to interrupt the train of thought in order to
                            discuss a more general problem first.</p>
                        <p>As you know, in feeling around over the past six months to find a
                            solution to some of these problems, the U.S. has embarked simultaneously
                            on two parallel courses of action. It seems that the time has now come
                            when we should examine these courses in order to fit them together as
                            part of a whole, and in an effort to see what the U.S. itself can gain.
                            These courses of action have been (a) attempts at forming an
                            international atomic agency, (b) an interim solution aimed primarily at
                            saving time, which has led us along the path of the various bilateral
                            agreements. It would seem that the first of these had become so
                            important a part of our policy that it could not be abandoned at this
                            point. This is perhaps just as well, inasmuch as the Agency is worldwide
                            in its action and thus will have reasons for its existence independent
                            of any auxiliary action which we may think necessary in Europe or
                            elsewhere. We must be continuously aware of the fact that differences in
                            technical capabilities between countries and areas could well impose
                            upon us the necessity of several types of atomic action, with such
                            action probably varying from area to area. We cannot expect that a
                            solution valid in Asia or even in South America will be valid in Europe.
                            I believe that the Agency will be of most use to the underdeveloped
                            countries of the world and should be so designed. This is of course
                            equivalent to saying that the Agency cannot be expected to have access
                            to classified material.</p>
                        <p>As I would see the Agency, it should be a place where the major powers
                            can pool knowledge through the uses of libraries and training centers,
                            pool a certain amount of fissionable material which would become
                            available to anyone needing it, and above all provide a place of
                            ownership or of redistribution for the plutonium or other fissionable
                            materials produced in reactors coming under its jurisdiction. This will
                            of course involve a decision on the part of the U.S. Government not to
                            demand for itself plutonium produced from fertile materials furnished by
                            American sources. In fact the international distribution of the
                            plutonium burden, which in time is bound to become a world problem
                            anyhow, is in itself sufficient reason for continuing with our present
                            Agency plans.</p>
                        <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381" facs="0409"/>
                        <p>Since any such agency which includes the Russians will undoubtedly be in
                            for a good deal of rough sailing, it seems clear that we must have other
                            strings to our bow; one way of accomplishing this is to maintain the
                            right to enter into agreements with countries or groups of countries
                            when it is to our advantage to do so and whatever the position of the
                            Agency on the matter might be.</p>
                        <p>The problem in Europe is really not whether we should enter into
                            multilateral agreements as such, but rather a question as to what sort
                            of multilateral agreements will yield the greatest benefits to the
                            United States. There are in existence three multinational groups which
                            would be available for such political purposes. First, <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> itself; second a grouping under the
                                <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> and third, the approach
                            through the Community of Six. I believe that whatever approach we use
                            could and should be designed to tighten the already existing bonds
                            between ourselves and the European area. It is for this reason that I
                            have suggested in the first part of this letter that we embark on a
                            policy of using the atom for political purposes.</p>
                        <p>It is clear from well understood lines of reasoning that a powerful
                            pro-American European economic unit is very desirable from the American
                            point of view; it seems equally clear as a result of the <gloss
                                target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss> failure that one must look to the
                            United States to provide some additional bonding incentive which will
                            insure the holding together of such a European unit. It appears that
                            atomic energy might well be such an incentive, not so much because of
                            the immediate economic benefits, which will start out by being small,
                            but rather because the emotionalism surrounding atomic energy at the
                            moment might serve as an answer to the negative emotionalism left as an
                            aftermath of the <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss>. On the other hand,
                            while we would hope that <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss>
                            would pass the a six-parliament test, we cannot ignore the danger that
                            it might not. It does not seem possible that the U.S. would ever wish to
                            provide an international agency consisting of 80 some odd nations, with
                            classified information or with some of the other more attractive bits of
                            atomic trading material such as substantial amounts of enriched
                            material, but it does not seem entirely impossible that a basic decision
                            could be made to provide such things to selected countries or to
                            selected groups of countries.</p>
                        <p>I do not wish to appear to recommend at this time just how the particular
                            group forming such a unit should be selected. It would seem desirable to
                            build around the group of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> powers
                            as such as well as to help certain of the neutral countries such as
                            Sweden, Switzerland and Austria. The extent to which <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss> will in fact have supranational
                            powers is itself going to be extremely controversial and this point may
                            be expected to raise opposition from certain groups.</p>

                        <p>Since the Coal and Steel Community has already given us the concept of
                            the Community of Six, however, and since any effort to enlarge this
                            grouping and still achieve supranationality would lead to enormous
                            difficulties, I believe it worthwhile analyzing in some detail the
                            practical problems which would face us and the benefits which would
                            accrue to us if we were temporarily to consider some special action with
                            regard to the Community countries by themselves. This is not really

                                in telegram 3225 from Paris, January 17. (Department of State,
                                Central Files, 840.1901/1–1756)</note> makes provision for the
                            adherence of additional members; furthermore, starting with the
                            Community has the great advantage of encompassing the Franco-German
                            problem from the beginning.</p>
                        <p>In other words, while I believe a larger grouping would be highly
                            desirable, from a practical point of view if we only secure the
                            continued adherence of Germany to the Western world, I believe we will
                            have accomplished a very great deal indeed. I need only point out to you
                            the enormous power left in the hands of the Soviets vis-à-vis Germany,
                            first by the occupation of East Germany and second by Russian control
                            over the Oder-Neisse line. The time is going to come when the United
                            States and Europe combined are going to have to exercise the greatest
                            possible attraction to enable the Germans to overcome Soviet
                            blandishments stemming from these two Soviet trump cards.</p>
                        <p>As you know from your conversations with <persName corresp="#p_MJ1"
                                >Monnet</persName>, he is currently planning a meeting of his
                            International Committee for January 17 and 18, at which time he hopes to
                            have the Committee accept the resolution which you have seen. The last
                            paragraph of this resolution recommends to the parliaments of the six
                            countries that a treaty embodying the point set forth in the resolution
                            be submitted to the parliaments by April 30, 1956. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> seems very hopeful that the
                            Committee will act to pass the resolution and that the resulting
                            political effect in Europe will be very great. It seems highly unlikely
                            that the April 30 deadline will be met, but in any event any part we
                            play in this maneuver must be worked out and played in the time between
                            the passing of the resolution and the subsequent parliamentary
                            action.</p>
                        <p>I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> resolution goes far beyond the
                            conclusions of the original Brussels report in at least three ways.
                            First, the resolution clearly is designed to bind <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss> toward working in the field of
                            peaceful atomic uses <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0411"/>only. This
                            point, while inherent in the original Brussels report, is in no place so
                            clearly spelled out. Second, the resolution definitely puts <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss> under the Coal and Steel
                            Community Assembly and thus much more clearly emphasizes the
                            supranational aspect of <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss>.
                            Third, the resolution binds the committee to work definitely for a
                            common European market, at least in the field of atomic energy. The
                            original report, while recommending this same attack, seems not to be
                            quite so forceful. Furthermore we must always keep in mind that the
                            Brussels report only suggests that 15% of the various national atomic
                            budgets be turned over to <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss>.
                            It seems clear, therefore, that publication of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> resolution will force into the
                            open a good deal of opposition which may, at the moment, be in hiding.
                            We are clearly going to be in a much better position to assess the
                            practical possibilities of <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss>
                            after the resolution has appeared.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> has pressed me in the
                            strongest possible terms to ask the Department not to conclude any
                            further power reactor agreements during the coming spring months. He is
                            particularly anxious that the U.S. not enter into an agreement with
                            France at this point, nor with Germany. I have pointed out to him that
                            the German Cabinet has decided in the last few weeks to approach the
                            American Government for a bilateral agreement on research reactors and
                            have told him two things. First, the U.S., because of the President’s
                            own statements, could not refuse a research bilateral to Germany at this
                            time should the latter actually request it, and second, that I would be
                            very much afraid of the effect on French public opinion if a research
                            bilateral were signed in the near future with Germany and not with
                            France. I have told him that the French Government has refused, as of
                            this moment, to request from us a normal research bilateral, in spite of
                            the fact that they could certainly use the material thus provided for a
                            part of their contemplated program. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1"
                                >Monnet</persName> sees the point of this and will discuss the
                            problem with <persName>Armand</persName> within the next few days in
                            order to see whether it would not be possible to get France also to
                            apply for a research bilateral.</p>
                        <p>In the original draft of this letter I had suggested that the Department
                            put off initiating a research bilateral with Germany until after January
                            17 because of the effect here in Paris and the possible effect on the
                            French members of <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName>’s
                            Committee. Events have, however, moved too quickly and the press has
                            already carried notices concerning the forthcoming U.S.-German
                            negotiations. The crypto-Communists daily <hi rend="italic"
                                >Libération</hi> on December 23 headlined its report
                            “German-American Blackmail puts French Atomic Industry in Peril.” The
                            whole article will be found in Embassy Despatch 1236<note n="5"

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> is of course fully cognizant
                            of the many difficulties ahead in his attempts to have <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss> formed. He analyzes the
                            difficulties as first, those due to the German industrialists, of which
                            we are all so very aware; second, those due to the “French technicians”
                            including the military who desire to maintain uranium ore accruing to
                            France from the metropolitan area or from the colonies, for a French
                            weapons endeavor. (It is thus clear that there are powerful persons in
                            France who will be opposed to the <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >Euratom</gloss> project and this is one indication as to who, in
                            addition to the opponents of supranationality, will be in opposition and
                            of the point around which they will be rallying.)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName>’s third listed difficulty in
                            the way of <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss>’s formation is
                            the American and British bilateral with Belgium, and this point is one
                            on which we must reach a policy decision in the near future. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> believes it will be impossible to
                            form a group in which one member of the Community will have access to
                            information or material which other members of the Community do not
                            possess. I believe that this is a valid point. According to <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SPH1"
                                >Spaak</persName> has promised him that Belgium will be willing to
                            release this restricted information to <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >Euratom</gloss> if the latter be founded and if the U.S. will
                            agree. If this should be true, (and I believe that the U.S. should check
                            this point privately with <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>)
                            the first decision which we have to make if whether the U.S. is ready
                            and able to extend a most favored national clause to the restricted
                            atomic data in Belgium’s possession, at least insofar as the other
                            members of the Community are concerned. Our relations with Belgium in
                            the field are of course fundamental.</p>
                        <p>I agree with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> in that I
                            do not believe that <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss> can be
                            founded unless we are in a position to answer this question
                            substantially in the affirmative.</p>
                        <p>In my discussions with <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName>, I
                            have pointed out that there seemed to me to be other difficulties which
                            will have to be surmounted in the attempt to form <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss>. The first of these he also
                            agrees will be a serious additional obstacle. This is the question which
                            would arise if one of the other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            powers, let us say Norway or Denmark, should ask to join <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss> subsequent to its formation.
                            One of the main reasons, at least from the European viewpoint, for the
                            formation of <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss> is that such
                            action would set a European unit on the path toward becoming eventually
                            independent of the U.S., at least so far as atomic power is concerned.
                            One of the most jealously guarded prerogative of this independence would
                            be the right to accept other free countries into <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss> without an American veto. We
                            thus have the most favored nation dilemma again in a second and more
                            difficult form. Would the U.S. agree to allow other countries in Western
                            Europe to adhere to <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss> if <pb
                                n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0413"/>such new countries would agree
                            to the necessary security provisions which would already have been setup
                            and agreed to by us? To me this seem a much more difficult question to
                            answer affirmatively than the first and I can only recommend that when
                            the study is made of the first question, that some attempt also be made
                            to find a satisfactory formula for the second. If we use the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> formula in the sense that we would
                            consent to the adherence of other nations of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> group without further question on our
                            part, then we will still not have provided for the three neutrals,
                            Sweden, Switzerland and Austria. It may well be that this is one of the
                            prices of being neutral; at any rate I have not been able to think the
                            problem through in any way as to yield a solution which would not at the
                            same time raise most difficult problems requiring special Congressional
                            action.</p>
                        <p>If the <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> resolution is passed
                            in its present form, and is eventually accepted by the several
                            parliaments (and this is a very big if indeed), it would mean that the
                            powers entering <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss> would have
                            renounced, as a unit, the right to manufacture atomic weapons. It is
                                <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName>’s intention, although
                            it is not spelled out in his resolution (and again many ifs are
                            involved), the French plutonium would be part of the assets which France
                            would bring to the new organization. The U.S. then would have
                            transplanted to <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss> the problems
                            inherent in French, or for that matter, European possession of weapons
                            and the problem of the disposition of the plutonium or uranium 233
                            produced in the continental power program. Since this area will in time
                            be undoubtedly the greatest source of such materials, effective control
                            is essential. The extent to which <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >Euratom</gloss> would be in a position to exercise control remains
                            to be seen, but it is hard to conceive of the U.S. being in a position
                            to do so indefinitely by itself. The decision as to which type of
                            control (U.S. or <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss>) should be
                            tried is a basic one for the United States. While we will have to offer
                            encouragement at all stages, we cannot very well take the decision until
                            the <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss> treaty is finalized,
                            and, remembering the fate of the <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss>, it
                            should certainly not take effect unless and until the <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss> treaty does.</p>
                        <p>I would like to add one further note at this point. The simplest solution
                            for the U.S. in this dilemma, and one which I am sure will be discussed
                            at home, is the possibility of declassifying reactor power data in order
                            to get around the complications inherent in the transfer of such data to
                            other countries. I cannot emphasize strongly enough that such action
                            would appear to be a very grave mistake on our part. In the first place
                            we are always going to be faced with a demand for something which is
                            hidden behind our security screen or which the European countries
                            suspect is hidden there. The problem therefore is one which will always
                            be with us and one which it is far <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386"
                                facs="0414"/>better to face squarely from the very beginning.
                            Furthermore, if we consent only to the transfer of nonclassified data,
                            we have doomed <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss> to extinction
                            before it starts, for the real binding power in the organization, at
                            least in the beginning, is going to be the right to receive something
                            which no other country or group of countries can get, that is,
                            information which is classified. The act of declassifying, therefore,
                            seems to me to destroy any hope of finding a strong enough cement with
                            which to get the organization started.</p>
                        <p>A further matter which must be kept in mind is the problem which is now
                            under consideration by the Commission as a result of a British démarche
                            to <persName>Gerry Smith</persName>. What is the U.S. attitude toward
                            the building of a U–235 enrichment plant in Europe? The French claim to
                            have spent $1,000,000 on research towards such a plant already. It has
                            not been possible for us to check how far they might have succeeded but
                            I am under the impression that progress has not been too satisfactory
                            and the Brussels report intimates that design information for such a
                            plant would be expected of us. Dr. <persName>Kenneth</persName> Davis,
                                <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> Director of Reactor Development,
                            appears to feel that such a path may well turn out to be uneconomical
                            for the future. I believe that in return for assurances on our part of
                            the availability of a satisfactory amount of enriched material over the
                            next five year period the Europeans might be convinced that the
                            construction of such a plant could be put off for that period, provided
                            we promised to discuss the matter with them again before the end of the
                            period. By some such maneuver we could hope to limit the transferal of
                            restricted data to that involving reactor construction and could hope to
                            get around the difficulty presented by restricted data in the gaseous
                            diffusion field.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion then, what I am essentially proposing seems to be the
                            following: <list>

                                    which American industry already has access to. This is
                                    equivalent to saying that some restricted data in the
                                    confidential category be made available to certain multilateral
                                    groups. It is desirable in the case of Europe that this grouping
                                    contain as many countries as possible. The Community of Six
                                    grouping, however, offers certain possible advantages, such as a
                                    measure of supranationality. It would seem desirable therefore
                                    to start with this group and attempt to bring other nations into

                                    power agreements and make clear why we are doing so. Refusal to
                                    conclude a bilateral agreement, research or otherwise, will
                                    inevitably have some adverse effect on Franco-American

                                    considered in the broadest and deepest sense. Among the most
                                    difficult questions to be considered is whether U.S., <gloss

                                    with any degree of realism: (1) what power <gloss

                        <p>At the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting on November 21, you
                            spoke of the great importance that should be attached to European
                            integration. I have been giving consideration to specific measures in
                            our power which might encourage such European development.</p>
                        <p>I believe that only the Community of Six offers promise of opening the
                            way to a genuine United States of Europe. There are various other
                            institutions, different in their scope of activity, their aims, and the
                            degree of our involvement, which contribute to European cooperation but
                            not to supranationality. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the
                                <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> are made up of members drawn
                            from the entire Atlantic Community and their objective is closer
                            cooperation. <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss> provides a cooperative
                            framework for constructive association of the United Kingdom with
                            France, Germany, the <gloss target="#t_Benelux1">Benelux</gloss>, and
                            Italy.</p>
                        <p>The Coal and Steel Community, however, is a proven and successful
                            institution in European political and economic life. The six member
                            governments are now recovering from the <gloss target="#t_EDC1"
                                >EDC</gloss> setback and beginning, anew, to explore possibilities
                            for expanding as a Community into new fields, with great promise that
                            they will succeed in the field of peaceful uses of atomic energy. Even
                            in this field, however, there is influential opposition and the
                            Community’s efforts may fail without concrete United States support.</p>
                        <p>If the six countries set up an integrated institution possessing
                            effective central and inspection authority in the field of peaceful uses
                            of atomic energy, control over military uses of atomic energy by these
                            six countries would be simplified, and there would be set a precedent
                            for similar regional arrangements elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>Success would bring the incalculable political and psychological
                            advantage of tying Germany more firmly into a Western European
                            community. It would confer upon the Community great technical and
                            economic advantages.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances, I believe that we should prepare to take
                            active measures to stimulate the six to come to a conclusion which
                            offers real promise for consolidating and enlarging their integration.
                            For us to seize this opportunity will require placing ourselves <pb
                                n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0417"/>in a position to make a maximum

                            should act without delay to place ourselves in such position.</p>
                        <p>As you know, pursuant to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policy, we
                            are now engaged in the early phases of bilateral negotiations with some
                            of the six countries looking towards industrial nuclear power
                            cooperation. Any resulting agreements should reflect in some way the
                            possibility of U.S. approval of assignment of the bilateral agreements
                            to the multilateral Community.</p>
                        <p>If you concur in the above conclusions, I suggest that you direct <gloss

                            an urgent basis moves which the United States could make in the atomic
                            energy field to encourage six-country integration, and in the meantime
                            to take steps to assure that any bilateral negotiations with these six
                            countries looking to cooperation in the nuclear power field will not
                            take such form as to embarrass the larger objectives we have in

                            the fact that the U.S. atomic aid effort is equally intended for all our
                            friends and that differences in form and scope are primarily due to the
                            inevitable differences in the ability of aid receiving countries or
                            organizations of countries to make effective economic use of such aid
                            and to guard it against undesired military use.</p>

                                    as follows:</p>
                                <p>“We have in mind that at such a meeting, you, perhaps supported
                                    by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> and Mr.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName>, would state
                                    the reasons, in broad terms, why the President and you attach
                                    importance to European integration. We would suggest that you
                                    then ask the Commission to submit by February 1 a comprehensive
                                    statement covering those actions which the U.S. could offer to
                                    the Community of Six to catalyze development of effective
                                    supranational integration in the atomic energy field. This would
                                    be a request for authoritative technical advice as to what the
                                    U.S. <hi rend="italic">could</hi> do, without regard in the
                                    first instance to legal, economic, or other considerations.”
                                        (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, 840.1901/1–2056)</p></note>
                            The Secretary said that the President firmly believed that a great
                            contribution to world peace could be made through unification on the
                            Continent of Europe. There was in Western Europe the potentiality for
                            integration of skills, resources and purposes. For this integration to
                            take place, the participation of the United Kingdom was not essential.
                            Were Western European integration to take place, this could remove the
                            burden of Europe from the back of the United States, draw France and
                            Germany together, and constitute a unified pool of power to balance the
                            USSR. The general concept was given eloquent expression by the President
                            in the speech he made in 1951 before the English Speaking Union in
                                London.<note n="3" xml:id="d149fn3">Reference is to a speech made by

                        <p>The forces in Europe which support this concept created the Schuman Plan
                            where six countries were brought together in a supranational
                            relationship for control of coal and steel. These six countries
                            considered the establishment of a European Defense Community, but this
                            effort failed in September 1954. The six countries, together with the
                            United Kingdom, created in consequence a Western European Union whose
                            ties together are looser but whose commitments to each other involve a
                                <gloss target="#t_UKG1">U.K.</gloss> contribution to the defense of
                            Western Europe. The movement towards integration is now being revived
                            under the leadership of M. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName>
                            and M. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>. <persName

                            they attempt to advance but is not deeply involved at the working level.
                            The Italians are also interested in the movement towards integration.
                            France has been the laggard in this general movement.</p>
                        <p>After his resignation from the position of President of the High
                            Authority of the Coal and Steel Community, M. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1"
                                >Monnet</persName> began to <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0420"
                            />organize a backlog of political support for a renewal of momentum
                            towards integration. He has obtained the support of labor and other
                            significant segments of political influence in the six countries. He has
                            made notable progress by gaming the support of the Socialists in
                            Germany. In France, labor and the Socialist Party—under the leadership
                            of M. <persName corresp="#p_MG2">Mollet</persName> who is apt to be the
                            next Prime Minister—have aligned themselves with <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName>’s plans. There now appears to be
                            a real chance of getting the European integration movement off the
                            ground.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> bears responsibility for study
                            and judgment on technical aspects of the potentialities in the field of
                            atomic energy. Both the President and the Department of State, however,
                            wish to give strong support to this most hopeful manifestation of
                            interest by forces in Europe which have the capability of bringing
                            Germany and France together, of becoming strong enough to withstand
                            Soviet action, and engaging in programs which can catch the imagination
                            of the West Germans and forestall a dangerous possibility of a German
                            movement towards reunification in opposition to what might be the broad
                            interests of the West. It is within this broad perspective that we wish
                            to do something for European unification and encourage those forces now
                            concerned with common development of atomic energy. If this succeeds,
                            the community can then proceed into other fields of activity. If they
                            fail, the integration movement is apt to fall apart with little hope
                            that it can be reconstituted, thus presenting a very bleak outlook for
                            the future.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that he hoped that the Atomic Energy Commission
                            could study this problem in a broad perspective and find ways to help
                            the movement. He hoped that the commission would not think in terms of
                            existing laws, regulations and inhibitions, but rather define in maximum
                            terms what lay within the realm of possibility. If we chose as a
                            Government to take certain actions which required amendment of laws, the
                            Secretary said these laws could be amended. He believed that the
                            Congress supported European integration perhaps more vigorously than the
                            Executive Branch itself. This was evident in Congressional discussion of
                            the Marshall Plan and in Congressional adoption of the
                                <persName>Richards Amendment</persName><note n="4" xml:id="d149fn4"
                                >This amendment to the Mutual Security Act of 1953, introduced by
                                Representative <persName>James P. Richards</persName> (D.–S.C.),
                                stipulated that half of the funds provided for European military aid
                                could be made available only to the European Defense Community or to
                                its member countries. For text of this law, enacted on July 16,
                                1953, see 67 Stat. 152.</note> which related to the European Defense
                            Community. Thus, if a Government program could be shown to be prudent
                            and sound and would contribute to the national interest, the Congress
                            would doubtless amend existing legislation to make that program
                            possible.</p>
                        <pb n="393" xml:id="pg_393" facs="0421"/>
                        <p>The Secretary stated the belief that the possibilities for effective
                            control of atomic energy programs might well be greater were these
                            programs subjected to one authority than would be the case if they were
                            administered by separate national authorities. Integration of control
                            would reduce the dangers of a virulent rivalry between France and
                            Germany in connection with production and use of weapons grade nuclear
                            materials. There would be other advantages for a group approach and our
                            study might well show that we could give more help to a community than
                            to countries individually.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that it was our
                            view that the Europeans were determined to achieve atomic energy
                            independence with or without the help of the United States. He stated
                            the belief that what we can offer to the Europeans is a wasting asset.
                            He stressed the urgency of a study clarifying the potentialities. On the
                            basis of a determination of possibilities for U.S. action, we could then
                            decide what to do.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> expressed his
                            gratitude for having heard directly from the Secretary an expression of
                            views on this subject. He said that the Commissioners prized this
                            experience, and that the Secretary’s observations would be of great
                            assistance to the Atomic Energy Commission as it proceeded with its
                            work. He said that the President’s directive was under study. He
                            reported that M. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> had met
                            him in Geneva during August and had advanced views regarding European
                            integration and atomic energy. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1"
                                >Strauss</persName> had been quite guarded in his reactions,
                            believing himself without authority to evaluate M. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName>’s viewpoint, and not knowing
                            whether M. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName>’s activities
                            reflected a desire to repair his personal fortunes or something more.
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said that in the
                            course of time the Commission would have worked up a report containing
                            its views. As looked upon by the Commission, the problem at hand would
                            not only involve a question of diversion of material but also a
                            safeguarding of classified information. This problem had presented
                            itself in connection with the French proposals for a bilateral. The
                            Commission assumed that involved in the project were as many doubtful
                            characters from the security standpoint proportionately as were to be
                            found in France generally. The Commission has not concluded a bilateral
                            with the French and could not, under existing laws and practices,
                            execute a power bilateral involving classified material because it could
                            not certify that the French security procedures were as reliable as our
                            own. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said that
                            the French problem in a sense defined the general problem of security
                            presented by dealing with a group of countries since the lowest common
                            denominator of the group might well be controlling.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Murray</persName> asked whether the views expressed by the
                            Secretary indicated a preference for European integration in the atomic
                            field over continued support of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
                                <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0422"/>He also asked whether our
                            purposes required holding back on atomic energy power bilaterals. The
                            Secretary responded by distinguishing three general approaches to
                            advancing United States’ interests in this field. One was the <gloss
                                target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>. He believed that this Agency would
                            come into being very slowly. The second was the bilateral approach and
                            he assumed that these could go forward. In fact, he had specifically
                            opposed a suggestion that bilateral negotiations be suspended. The third
                            was U.S. support, if possible, of efforts to create an integrated
                            European institution in the atomic energy field. The Secretary did not
                            believe that these three approaches were mutually in conflict and should
                            go forward simultaneously.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said that the
                            Commission objected to any foot-dragging in the handling of bilateral
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>In further elaboration of his view, the Secretary stated that if an
                            integrated European community is to be created, the initiative must come
                            from the Europeans themselves, and that the United States should avoid
                            actions of coercive character. He elaborated also upon the complications
                            surrounding the successful completion of work leading towards an
                            International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Murray</persName> stressed the problem of secrecy in this
                            field but said that if the Government should decide to go ahead with
                            support of a Community of Six, we could give them a great deal of
                            support and assistance. Mr. <persName>Libby</persName> observed that the
                            French appeared to want to produce atomic weapons. Mr.
                                <persName>Murray</persName> said that he believed that weapons
                            manufacturing capacity would be developing in a number of countries. To
                            forestall this would require keeping the French out of the gaseous
                            diffusion process. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJA1">Hall</persName>
                            observed, however, that if the purpose of European integration is to
                            achieve atomic independence, they should have a gaseous diffusion plant
                            but perhaps such a development was precisely what was clearly contrary
                            to United States interests. Mr. <persName>Libby</persName> added that
                            the Europeans could well do this without our help, but that it would be
                            extremely expensive and, in any case, we could not help them with it on
                            account of inhibitions of United States law. Mr.
                                <persName>Murray</persName> said that as a practical matter we
                            could, if policy justified it, go as far as we wanted to go in helping
                            the Europeans expand and accelerate their programs. He expressed the
                            personal opinion, moreover, that we should get on with power reactor
                            construction abroad.</p>
                        <p>At this point in the discussion, the Secretary expressed his regret that
                            he was obliged to keep an appointment with the Ambassador of <pb n="395"

                            the communication from the Soviet Ambassador.<note n="6"

                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said that he
                            wanted to cooperate with the Department to the hilt—up to the legal
                            limit. The Secretary said that he hoped that the Commission might exceed
                            those limits and consider all possibilities, leaving for subsequent
                                <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> and State determination any
                            decision as to which of the possibilities should be selected as safe,
                            prudent and wise for the United States. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> stressed the urgency of the
                            study since there are about sixty to ninety days within which amendments
                            to current legislation might be prepared for submission to the Congress.
                            As he departed, the Secretary mentioned the fact that he expected to
                            discuss atomic energy matters with Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> at the end of the month. He
                            anticipated a negative attitude by the United Kingdom to developments
                            towards integration in Europe. The British tradition, almost
                            instinctive, is to favor European divisions rather than emergence on the
                            Continent of greater unity and strength.</p>
                        <p>After the departure of the Secretary, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1"
                                >Merchant</persName> offered a few additional comments. He said that
                            we should not lose sight of the fact that the United Kingdom is for the
                            Europeans an alternative source of material and assistance. From the
                            United Kingdom standpoint, competitive national developments in the
                            atomic energy field might well yield considerable commercial advantage.
                            He also said that he was concerned over conclusion of a bilateral with
                            Germany in advance of conclusion of a bilateral with France since this
                            would almost inescapably generate French suspicions and undesirable
                            tensions on the Continent. He felt that the main point of our joint
                            study of this problem was to look for the maximum potentialities of
                            United States assistance and cooperation without regard to legal,
                            economic or any other limitations which might now inhibit our planning.
                            As this was done, we could then proceed to a second stage of determining
                            what was prudent and safe in the way of a new relationship between the
                            United States and Europe. The third stage would require formulation and
                            presentation of legislation, as needed, to the Congress.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> expressed his view
                            that it was desirable to go ahead with a French bilateral and reported
                            on the fact that the French had been deeply aggrieved thus far in their
                            failure to obtain one.</p>
                        <pb n="396" xml:id="pg_396" facs="0424"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> offered the view that a
                            joint agency might well help us substantially in solving the kind of
                            security problem presented by the French. A new agency starting afresh
                            in this field could choose new staff and institute new procedures in
                            conformity with security standards and procedures acceptable from our
                            standpoint. This could help us in meeting our problems.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> replied that this
                            presented the fundamental problems of sovereignty, to which Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> replied that the Coal and Steel
                            Community already constituted an institution in which the six countries
                            had waived sovereignty in favor of a common authority. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> also went on to say that the
                            control over personnel, inspection, materials of a common authority
                            would make possible on a collective basis what might not be possible for
                            individual states to do.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Libby</persName> expressed an intense interest in the
                            supra-nationality of the Coal and Steel Community and requested further
                            information on this subject.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said that he was
                            surprised to learn about the supra-national character of the Coal and
                            Steel Community, and would like to know more about it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Murray</persName> expressed the view that the <gloss
                                target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> was not the place where a decision
                            should be made on the desirability of changes in the law, but would have
                            to be governed by a Government decision made by the Department of
                            Defense, the State Department, etc.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> took this occasion to
                            elucidate the role which we hope could be performed by the Commission.
                            He stated that the Department needed a great deal of help from the
                            Commission on all technical aspects of process for production and
                            utilization of atomic energy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Libby</persName> stated flatly that the United States could
                            not tell the Europeans how to make a gaseous diffusion plant. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> wondered if this
                            might not be a premature judgment at this stage. Mr.
                                <persName>Libby</persName> quickly replied that the British gaseous
                            diffusion plant does not work, that he doubted the efficiency of the
                            Russian process, and that we do effectively possess a monopoly in this
                            sector of the whole field.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> added that a
                            gaseous diffusion plant to be efficient would produce quantities of
                            material far beyond the foreseeable power requirements of Europe.
                            Further, for it to be operated, it would consume enormous quantities of
                            power. We may, however, be in a position to supply the Europeans with
                            materials which, from a price standpoint, would be advantageous for them
                            to obtain from us rather than to produce themselves.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> reported on a
                            conversation he had had with M. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1"
                                >Monnet</persName><note n="7" xml:id="d149fn7">No record of this
                                conversation has been found in Department of State files.</note>
                            where he argued that from an economic standpoint European erection of
                            gaseous diffusion facilities made little sense. Notwithstanding this
                            argumentation, M. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName>
                            reiterated the very strong sense of compulsion on the part of the
                            Europeans to achieve atomic independence. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> expressed the belief that if
                            European erection of gaseous diffusion facilities was undesirable, we
                            should be prepared to meet the Europeans on better ground and the
                            purpose of our joint study should be to define what this might be.
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said that the
                            Commission was now working on this problem. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> said that he hoped that the
                            findings of the Commission might be coordinated with the Department
                            prior to submission to the White House. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> explained that the White House
                            directive had been acknowledged only and that future communication to
                            the White House would be discussed with the State Department in
                            advance.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> summarized his
                            understanding of the essence of the discussion by saying that he
                            believed we were in agreement that the United States should help other
                            countries develop peaceful uses of atomic energy, and that we should
                            back developments leading to integration in Europe. He wondered,
                            however, whether our policy with respect to atomic weapons was so
                            clearly defined. He felt that it was important for us to spell out
                            precisely what this attitude was or should be.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> said that he felt
                            certain that the Secretary’s view was that we should discourage
                            production in Europe of atomic weapons.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRW1">Barnett</persName> said that members of
                            the Commission might be interested in three distinguishable trends of
                            thought and discussion in Europe on the subject of atomic energy. Atomic
                            energy generally had caught the imagination of Europeans. In the <gloss
                                target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>—an Atlantic community-wide
                            organization mainly concerned with economic cooperation—there had been
                            active interest in cooperative arrangements designed to accelerate the
                            economic use of atomic energy. At Brussels, under the leadership of M.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>, another study was
                            going forward where the potentialities of atomic energy for contributing
                            to integration among the Community of Six were being examined. Both of
                            these groups had remained silent on the question of national atomic
                            energy programs for weapons production. The third group, headed by M.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> and called the
                            Political Action Committee for European integration, had agreed
                            unanimously to adopt a resolution which addresses itself specifically to
                            the weapons problem. Important political representatives from the six
                            countries are agreed that their community should collectively deny
                            themselves atomic weapons production. <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398"
                                facs="0426"/>They were also agreed as to the imperative necessity of
                            supra-national responsibility for the administration of effective
                            control and inspection authority. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRW1"
                                >Barnett</persName> dwelled upon the procedure whereby the Coal and
                            Steel Community’s supra-national authority was created, observing that
                            after Governments had agreed to a constitution, it was submitted for
                            ratification to Parliaments which thus made the constitution a genuine
                            supra-national entity. The <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName>
                            resolution, therefore, offers prospect that in the atomic energy field
                            an integrated authority would exist comparable to the authority of a
                            single state in the control, financial, security and other fields.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that from our
                            understanding of the European situation we are led to believe that,
                            regardless of the success of the movement towards integration, we can
                            anticipate continuing momentum towards increasingly active and
                            successful programs in the field of atomic energy. These were likely to
                            go ahead regardless of what the United States chose to do.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said that so far
                            as weapons production abroad was concerned he believed that in essence
                            our role in this situation was to buy time within which we could
                            determine what was in the best interests of the United States and the
                            West, or perhaps there could be some resolution of the US-USSR
                            deadlock.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJA1">Hall</persName> asked what the
                            Department’s thinking was on timing of the study. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that he hoped that the
                                <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> could complete its work within
                            about two weeks. We considered ourselves to be under some pressure since
                            the Europeans will be asking for our views, perhaps at a time over which
                            we could exercise no control.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> said that from the
                            standpoint of the Department the impact of our findings might be
                            greatest if we could be in a position to volunteer them prior to an
                            initiative on the part of the Europeans themselves. If we must rule out
                            the possibility of assisting in the creation of a gaseous diffusion
                            plant, we should at least have in mind the range of things that it is
                            possible for us to do.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said once again
                            that the Commission was currently studying the problem and would, as
                            soon as practical, let us know what its conclusions were. He believed
                            that two weeks was too short a time since the Commission is imminently
                            obliged to make appearances before the Joint Committee. This was certain
                            to be a grueling period and, though the substance of the Commission’s
                            work might be of a mere ephemeral importance than the question we have
                            before us, he would prefer to deal with the European problem with
                            greater concentration than would be possible now. Therefore, he
                            suggested that we envisage completion of the <gloss target="#t_AEC1"
                                >AEC</gloss> study sometime during February. He repeated once more
                            the necessity of clarifying our views on the problem as quickly as
                            possible since any changes in <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0427"
                            />the law should be submitted to the Congress well before its
                            adjournment, which can be anticipated in advance of the summer
                                conventions.<note n="8" xml:id="d149fn8">In a letter to President

                            United States officials over a 3-day period. During the afternoon

                        <p>3467. After spending week back in Paris I feel I should raise serious
                            warning flag over one important aspect of present <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> proposal. Sometime during
                            course of past two months <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName>
                            added new thought to original <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> idea, namely that no country taking part in <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> should have right to make
                            atomic weapons (while this conception of <persName corresp="#p_MJ1"
                                >Monnet</persName>’s has apparently been wholeheartedly adopted by
                                <persName corresp="#p_MG2">Guy Mollet</persName>, I feel that its
                            retention in <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> project would
                            create great difficulties for final ratification here in France). French
                            already have, or are about to have, capability for manufacturing nuclear
                            weapons and this is only respect in which their position is presently
                            more favorable than German position.</p>
                        <p>I am convinced that French will not voluntarily renounce this right
                            without extremely bitter Parliamentary battle in which, at this stage,
                            proponents of maintenance of French right to manufacture nuclear weapons
                            would seem to have advantage. Any such political fight would be bound to
                            arouse the same type of ultra-nationalistic feeling that was
                            successfully aroused against the <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss>.
                            Beginning of such a campaign can already be seen in public opposition of
                                <persName>Debre</persName> and <persName>Weygand</persName><note

                                >Monnet</persName> proposal. I am also informed that Juin<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d152fn3">Marshal Alphonse P. Juin, Commander-in-Chief of
                                Allied Land Forces in Central Europe.</note> is opposed to any such
                            concession by France. This does not mean that there is a strong movement
                            in France for immediate manufacture of nuclear weapons, but only that
                            permanent renunciation of this right will arouse the bitterest of
                            opposition.</p>
                        <p>Communists will probably, as they have already indicated, maintain their
                            opposition to <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> on other
                            grounds, i.e., opposition to all European unity schemes. Poujadists and
                            Gaullists will undoubtedly oppose giving up the right to manufacture as
                            being a derogation of national sovereignty. This in itself makes total
                            of over 225 votes against such a project and I am convinced the chances
                            are almost zero of obtaining required 300 favorable votes out of the
                            remaining 375 members of the Assembly.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, I fear that insistence on renunciation of right to manufacture
                            nuclear weapons may well mean the end of <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> as far as France is concerned.</p>
                        <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0430"/>
                        <p>I am also convinced that French will make no definite commitment toward
                            common market although they may well pass some sort of lip serving
                            resolution in favor of progress toward such a goal. Therefore, chances
                            of <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> are not good if Belgians
                            and Germans intend to insist on any very definite progress toward common
                            market as price of their support for <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>I would like to underline one specific danger for US in connection with
                            France. It would be most serious if French should come to believe that
                            US favored their renouncing right to manufacture atomic weapons. Such a
                            feeling would arouse storm of anti-American protest and would ensure the
                            defeat of any such project. If there is any chance of France permanently
                            renouncing right to make nuclear weapons, which I believe is only
                            extremely slight, it would certainly be ruined if it could be labelled
                            as an American project to deprive France of military power that could
                            otherwise be hers.</p>
                        <p>Finally I would like to warn against dangers of confusion in thinking by

                            approval of former currently appear good. This would naturally be major
                            helpful development but would not of itself necessarily mean more than
                            did French Assembly’s approval of resolution favoring <gloss
                                target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss> early in 1952. It would not mean that
                            major difficulties may not arise in actual treaty negotiations or
                            Parliamentary ratification processes. What situation will then be
                            naturally cannot now be foretold but premature optimism based on
                            approval of <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> resolution by
                            French and other Parliaments might well produce dangerous let down

                            at Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DGD1">Dillon</persName>’s last night
                            he spoke at great length of the problems facing the creation of <pb

                            British still feared a united productive Europe and therefore were
                            backing the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> atomic concepts which
                            was basically contrary to <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>’s
                            effort to integrate Europe and bring about the Common Market. He
                            believed that French political elements would not in the end reject the
                            plan as they had <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss>. Second, the <gloss

                                target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>. In particular he expressed his thanks
                            for our efforts to avoid any prohibition of the export of scrap because
                            otherwise the High Authority would have been forced in the past year to
                            declare a state of scarcity in the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>
                            which would have ended the common market for steel. M. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> expressed the hope that State,
                            Commerce, and the Steel Industry could work out an arrangement for the

                        <p>M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> mentioned his recent

                            he hoped to see again after the meeting of the Foreign Ministers in

                                11–12, to consider an interim report by the intergovernmental
                                committee.</note> Referring to the need for progress in the creation
                            of a common market and <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>, M.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> commented “the technical
                            market is always possible if the political will is in favor”. He noted
                            that the Community at one time was a vision but is now behaving as an
                            effective living being, in commerce, tariffs and coal and steel. He said
                            that Great Britain isn’t very anxious to see progress but that the High
                            Authority does not think Europe can wait and that the standard of living
                            needs to be raised by the operation of a common market. What is needed
                            in Europe, M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> continued, is
                            a common policy for energy, particularly because the steel industry in
                            Western Europe is expanding ahead of coal production. The relation of
                            power sources including atomic power must be decided by the Governments
                            of Europe working in common.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he was pleased to receive M. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> and said that he and the President
                            are strong supporters of the idea of European unity as symbolized by the
                            High Authority which M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName>
                            represents. The Secretary noted that it is hard to pursue great
                            conceptions such as the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> in a working

                            under the leadership of M. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName>
                            and M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName>. He said that we were
                            happy to have <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0433"/>helped in
                            obtaining an <gloss target="#t_EXIMBank1">EXIM bank</gloss> loan for the
                                <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> although it was true we have
                            business interests in the United States who dislike to see us loaning at
                            a low interest rate to competitors abroad. But this is a tribute, the
                            Secretary continued, to the intelligent idealism of the United States.
                            The Secretary noted that the appointment of <gloss target="#t_Amb1"
                                >Amb</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_BWW1">Butterworth</persName> as
                            our representative to the High Authority indicates the importance which
                            we attach to the organization.</p>
                        <p>Turning to what he termed “practical matters”, the Secretary took up the
                            question of steel scrap. He said the State Department felt that a
                            limitation on the export of scrap was not justified. He pointed out that
                            there had not been any question of prohibition of export but that a
                            limitation on the export of scrap had been asked for by certain
                            interests in this country. The Secretary pointed up his interest in this
                            question by mentioning his personal participation last year in a meeting
                            in the Department of Commerce when it was decided to postpone
                            restrictive action. He said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PHV1"
                                >Prochnow</persName> was dealing with this problem and that more
                            detailed discussions would take place in the next few days.</p>
                        <p>Turning to another practical matter, the Secretary commented on the
                            British attitude toward the common market. He said it was correct to say
                            the British are not full of enthusiasm for either <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> or the common market, but that
                            probably their enthusiasm was less for the common market than for <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>. Concerning the common market
                            the principal fear of the British is that the French would accept it
                            only with high tariffs, and the British fear the same lack of result as
                            happened with the <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss>. The Secretary
                            said that he and the President during the recent <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> visit had talked as persuasively
                            as they could and made the British realize the vigor of our attitude on
                            these matters. The Secretary commented that we were instructing our
                            Embassies in <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> member countries that
                            the <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> visit communiqué<note

                            not be interpreted as a U.S. recession from our position on these
                            matters.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary continued noting that we favor progress for political as
                            well as economic reasons. There is a need to continue to find ways to
                            draw France and Germany together in common institutions. Germany has the
                            choice of looking east to the USSR as well as to the west. In this
                            conflict we must be the magnet of attraction.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> if he
                            envisaged an enlargement of the functions of the <gloss target="#t_CSC1"
                                >CSC</gloss>—energy, for example. In any move of this sort the
                            impetus must come from Europe but the movement will have the sympathy
                            and support of the U.S.</p>

                        <p>M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> commented briefly on the
                            achievements of the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> and the <gloss
                                target="#t_EPU1">EPU</gloss> but added the question of integration
                            is much larger than can be encompassed in these organizations. The real
                            debate is not between the forms of the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                                >OEEC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> but rather
                            whether to integrate or not. M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1"
                                >Mayer</persName> added that the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss>
                            need not fear the French position concerning high tariffs because The
                            Netherlands, Belgium and Germany would never accept it. M. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> said that whereas the <gloss
                                target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> has opened the way we now need a
                            means of continuing in the same direction without turning back and that
                            each step must be a real and irrevocable one.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName>
                            thought that energy development might take place within the context of
                            the present organization (of the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>).
                            M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> replied that there could
                            not be two authorities without mutual consultation and that
                            interpenetration would be necessary.</p>
                        <p>M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> said that as far as a
                            general policy concerning energy development is concerned, he thought it
                            would be necessary for such development to have a common over-all
                            policy. He pointed out that as things now stand coal and oil have
                            different policies in the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The meeting then concluded at 5:00 p.m.</p>

                        <p>At dinner I sat between <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> and
                            the French Ambassador. There was a little desultory conversation about
                            atomic weapons in the course of which <persName corresp="#p_MR1"
                                >Mayer</persName> said that he did not believe that France would
                            ever give up for all time the right to have atomic weapons if others had
                            them. The French Ambassador said he was fully in accord with this
                            view.</p>
                        <p>The topic was resumed after dinner between <persName corresp="#p_MR1"
                                >Mayer</persName>, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1"
                                >Strauss</persName> and myself. At that time <persName
                                corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> made clear his strong belief that
                            France would never give up atomic weapons and that if <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> had this as a condition, it
                            would never be accepted by the <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0435"
                            />French Parliament. I suggested that in connection with the <gloss
                                target="#t_UNO1">UN</gloss> Atomic Energy Agency there might be an
                            agreement that “fourth countries” would not make atomic weapons for a
                            period of time—say five years—during which an effort would be made to
                            eliminate these weapons by agreement between the United States, the
                            Soviet Union and the United Kingdom. I thought that France and others
                            might well be willing during this period not to complicate the situation
                            by introducing a new element. <persName corresp="#p_MR1"
                                >Mayer</persName> seemed to think that this would be acceptable.</p>

                            made to go ahead with <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> alone
                            as first step. He said that he personally was strongly in favor of
                            European integration and of common market but that it was also necessary
                            to take into account what was possible, <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408"
                                facs="0436"/>and common market would not be possible for France
                            without great deal of prior negotiations, and also great deal of
                            education in France. <persName corresp="#p_PCP1">Pineau</persName>
                            expressed the fear that some of those in other countries who really were
                            not keen about <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> might attempt
                            to use the common market as a method of killing <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>. He asked me what the US
                            attitude was on tying <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> to the
                            common market. I replied that I had received no precise instructions on
                            this point but from what I knew of US policy I thought I could tell him
                            that, while we strongly favored the common market as a big step toward
                            European integration, we would much prefer the smaller step involved in
                            the adoption of <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> alone to no
                            advance at all in this field. <persName corresp="#p_PCP1"
                                >Pineau</persName> said he considered this a realistic viewpoint and
                            hoped it would prevail with other five countries.</p>

                            11:00 today at the White House. After the usual cordial exchange of
                            greetings M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> gave a
                            favorable and optimistic account of the functioning of the European Coal
                            and Steel Community, emphasizing that it had increasingly the support
                            not only of parliamentarians but of labor. Labor appeared to count on
                            the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> to improve the standard of
                            living more rapidly than in fact it would be able to. M. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> also touched on <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>, explained the present status
                            of negotiations, and expressed the hope that these negotiations would
                            come to fruition and thus permit the six participating countries to
                            increase their energy resources <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0437"
                            />which were needed now and would be needed even more in the future. He
                            emphasized that the experience of the Coal and Steel Community proved
                            that if the Europeans had the political will to unite, the way could be
                            found to solve the related problems.</p>
                        <p>In touching on the political importance of the Community, M. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> pointed out that the reason these
                            six countries could work unitedly was because the economies and the
                            standard of living of all six countries, with the exception of southern
                            Italy, were in about the same stage of development. However, southern
                            Italy, which was in reality an underdeveloped area, did offer an
                            opportunity to the industries of the Community in developing it and thus
                            bringing into being a good new market.</p>
                        <p>The President reaffirmed his conviction as to the importance of a united
                            Europe, indicating his belief that it would be the salvation both for
                            Europe and the Western world. He emphasized that a united Europe
                            consisting of 250 million-odd people, of whom at least 23 million were
                            skilled workers, would create an industrial complex comparable to the
                            United States, having, in fact, more skilled laborers than the U.S. He
                            expressed his belief that such a “third force” working with the rest of
                            the free world would change the whole complexion of present
                            circumstances and insure peace.</p>
                        <p>In thanking M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> for the
                            friendly greetings which he had conveyed from his colleagues in the
                            Community and from the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of France,
                            whom M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> had indicated were
                            committed to working for the integration of Europe, the President asked
                            him to convey to them his friendly greetings, to reiterate his profound
                            convictions about the importance of the unification of Europe, and to
                            tell them that we would do whatever we could to help. He added that of
                            course the initiative must remain with the Europeans themselves.</p>
                        <p>(M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> was obviously very
                            pleased with his reception by the President, including the fact that the
                            President posed for photographs with him at the end of his
                            interview.)</p>

                        <p>M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> reviewed the increase in
                            the rate of steel production in the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>
                            which occurred in 1954 and throughout 1955 and the continued high
                            production which has now reached a rate of over 55,000,000 metric tons
                            per annum. M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> observed that
                            no abatement in the demand for steel was in sight. He observed that the
                            high rates of production in the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>
                            during the last half of 1954, during 1955, and in 1956 required
                            extensive imports of ferrous scrap, including large tonnages from the
                            United States. M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> and
                                <persName>M. Rollman</persName> mentioned that the <gloss
                                target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> potential demand for ferrous scrap from
                            the U.S. had been in currently in excess of the working limitation of an
                            average of 150,000 metric tons per month which had been established for
                            the last half of 1955 and is in effect for the entirety of 1956. In
                            response to an inquiry, M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName>
                            and <persName>M. Rollman</persName> gave emphatic assurances that the
                            High Authority was capable of restraining purchases of U.S. scrap for
                            importation into the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> so that the
                            average of 150,000 m.t. per month would not be exceeded and that the
                            High Authority intended to keep imports within this limitation. This
                            limitation below demand is to be maintained because of strong demand in
                            the U.S. and related pressures for U.S. Government action to limit
                            exports and also as an added incentive to <gloss target="#t_CSC1"
                                >CSC</gloss> to consumers to find substitutes for imports of scrap
                            from the U.S.</p>
                        <p>M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> twice emphasized that if
                            imports of U.S. ferrous scrap were severely restricted, the High
                            Authority probably would have to yield to pressure from scrap consumers
                            and declare the existence of a scarcity of scrap. A concomitant action
                            would be for the High Authority to place the distribution of scrap under
                            allocation which would be administered by the governments of the member
                            states on a national basis. Hence, a common market in scrap could not be
                            maintained. Also, a probable result would be lessened capability to
                            resist pressures for declaring scarcities of coal, coke and steel with
                            consequent endangering of the effectiveness and substantive existence of
                            the European Coal and Steel Community.</p>

                        <p>M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> and <persName>M.
                                Rollman</persName> reviewed the reasons for establishing the
                            perequation or equalization payments to <gloss target="#t_CSC1"
                                >CSC</gloss> consumers of imported scrap and the operation of the
                            payment system. The levy per ton on all scrap consumed in the <gloss
                                target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> regardless of source which provides
                            funds for equalization payments has risen from an initial fee of
                            approximately $1 to around $9 currently and is expected to go higher.
                            Basic prices paid, plus the levy, bring the <gloss target="#t_CSC1"
                                >CSC</gloss> consumer’s current cost of U.S. scrap delivered to his
                            plant to approximately the same as that paid by a U.S. consumer at the
                            latter’s plant, according to <persName>M. Rollman</persName>. He said
                            scrap imported from the U.S. currently had a delivered cost (buying
                            price in the U.S. plus transportation costs) of about $75 per ton. This
                            compares with about $60 per ton for imports into the <gloss
                                target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> from sources other than the U.S.
                            Delivered prices for domestically collected scrap in Germany and France
                            currently are around $40 to $42 per ton. (It was observed that domestic
                            scrap brought around $22 per ton in the United Kingdom where the price
                            was fixed under government control.)</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> asked for an
                            explanation as to the reason for No. 1 heavy melting scrap being a much
                            larger proportion of total <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> imports
                            of U.S. ferrous scrap than this grade of scrap represents in total scrap
                            consumption by the U.S. steel industry. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> observed that it would be very
                            helpful for the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> to make every effort
                            to develop sources of scrap supplies outside the U.S. and to reduce the
                            proportion of heavy melting scrap in the total <gloss target="#t_CSC1"
                                >CSC</gloss> scrap imports from the U.S. <persName>M.
                                Rollman</persName> stated that a reduction in the portion of scrap
                            imports from the U.S. taken in the form of heavy melting scrap would
                            definitely reduce the rate of <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> steel
                            production. When pressed for further details as to why <gloss
                                target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> steel makers could not use a greater
                            proportion of No. 2 bundle scrap, <persName>M. Rollman said</persName>
                            he was not enough of a specialist in the matter to give the specific
                            difficulties which prevented a greater use of bundles.</p>
                        <p>M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> and <persName>M.
                                Rollman</persName> referred to the <gloss target="#t_CSC1"
                                >CSC</gloss> subsidy established in 1955 on enlarged use of pig iron
                            in lieu of scrap in steel making. They commented also on the expansion
                            and improvement of facilities for making pig iron, including new blast
                            furnaces, improved performance of existing blast furnaces, improved iron
                            ore preparation, etc.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> told M. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> of the U.S. interest in the
                            success of the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> operation and in
                            being as helpful as possible. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WS1"
                                >Weeks</persName> reviewed some of the serious problems the U.S.
                            must consider relative to the rate of consumption and export of ferrous
                            scrap. He mentioned his responsibility for administration of the Export
                            Control Act<note n="2" xml:id="d158fn2">This law was enacted on February
                                26, 1949. (63 Stat. 7)</note> and the necessity for consultations
                            with the several government <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0440"
                            />agencies and numerous interests concerned with this field. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> pointed out to M.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> that because of the
                            complexities of the scrap problems and unpredictability of related
                            developments, he was unable to assure that the export of any given
                            quantity of ferrous scrap would be permitted in 1956 in total, to the
                                <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> or to any other destination. In
                            so far as he was able to make a considered guess, however, he said he
                            thought it unlikely that the U.S. Government would find it necessary to
                            take any action which would prevent the <gloss target="#t_CSC1"
                                >CSC</gloss> from obtaining the contemplated amount of ferrous scrap
                            from the U.S. in 1956, an average of 150,000 metric tons per month or
                            nearly two million short tons for the year. He mentioned that his
                            concern about scrap exports pertained less to the immediate future than
                            to U.S. capabilities of maintaining full capacity steel production some
                            two, three, five or more years hence if domestic consumption and exports
                            of collected or obsolescent scrap continued at the 1955 rate or higher.
                            It was observed that much of the new capacity to make steel in the U.S.
                            which has been added in recent months and which is being planned for the
                            next few years is designed to consume relatively large quantities of
                            scrap. Electric furnaces make up much of this new U.S. capacity.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> also told M.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> that it would not be
                            practical to give any advance notice of a limitation on scrap exports if
                            the U.S. Government should find it necessary to impose such
                            restrictions.</p>
                        <p>There was general agreement that it would be advantageous to continue to
                            develop the full exchange of information on long-range prospects for
                            steel production and on prospective scrap requirements and
                            availability.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> expressed his great
                            appreciation of the courtesies shown him. He spoke of the Saar and of
                            the mistakes which, in his opinion, had been made by <persName
                                corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> in dealing with that situation. He
                            felt that the result, while bad, was not fatal to German-French
                            relations. He then spoke of the Roeschling Works and the importance of a
                            solution there. He said that certain American investment bankers were
                            thinking of trying to buy an interest which would be the balance of <pb
                                n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0441"/>power between the French and
                            the Germans. He said he might be seeing them in New York and wondered if
                            I had any views on the matter.</p>
                        <p>I said that this was a matter for “private enterprise” and that I could
                            not see any particular reason why the United States Government should
                            officially either persuade or dissuade the bankers from action in this
                            matter, although we would naturally take a benevolent view toward
                            anything which in fact helped to solve French-German differences.</p>
                        <p>Mayer then spoke of the vital importance for Franco-German relations of
                            creating <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>. He said if this
                            failed and the United States made a bilateral arrangement with the
                            Germans, this would begin to create suspicion which would grow and would
                            have a very disruptive force. The key to <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> was the unwillingness of the United States to make
                            a bilateral with the Germans. He thought that if the Germans thought
                            they could get a bilateral, they would prefer it to an integrated
                            approach.</p>
                        <p>I said the United States would like to have the six-power approach, but
                            that we could not be coercive. I said, however, that if it were apparent
                            that the other five European countries were all ready to proceed on this
                            basis and the only obstacle was a reluctance on the part of the German
                            industrialists, then we might perhaps find a way to be helpful. However,
                            until France, Italy and the <gloss target="#t_Benelux1">Benelux</gloss>
                            countries made their own positions clear, we could not very well tell
                            the Germans that only by going in could we deal with them. Mayer said he
                            understood this position.</p>
                        <p>We then went over the Communiqué and made a slight revision in the
                            sentence dealing with scrap. It was then agreed to be issued.<note n="2"

                            German atomic development. I am being erroneously quoted by some
                            industrialists as having taken stand with German Government that no
                            reactor should be built in Fed Rep but only in nearby states. Germans
                            very sensitive on issue of possible discriminatory treatment as compared
                            to other European nations and talk of control of their atomic
                            development. On the other hand a few leading bankers and second man of
                            Econ Ministry with whom I raised the issue of the dangers involved in
                            producing of plutonium by national governments were quick to see
                            political dangers and seemed sympathetic to a supranational processing
                            plant.</p>
                        <p>If there is any consideration in Washington of a power bilateral with the
                            French or other European nations (except Belgium with whom bilateral
                            already completed) such negotiations would constitute a very serious
                            hazard to good German-American relations unless parallel negotiations
                            with <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> were in progress even if
                            only offer of small amount of enriched fuel material were involved.
                                <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> undoubtedly still hoping
                            United States will make some very generous offer of enriched material
                            and technical knowledge to six-nation supranational agency. But if this
                            not likely to eventuate in near future and if power bilaterals should be
                            in process of negotiation with other European nations feel it essential
                            that German-US negotiations on same basis be initiated. Very important
                            that nothing be done which would look to the Germans as if we are party
                            to discrimination against them on atomic development even though they
                            would admit French were further advanced technically than they were.</p>
                        <p>Would like to emphasize again concern I expressed to Secretary, Under
                            Secretary and the President<note n="2" xml:id="d160fn2"><persName

                            develop on a nationalistic basis their own atomic development in
                            competition with the French unless some degree of European cooperation
                            in this field is achieved. To my mind that greatest source of anxiety is
                            that each nation will erect chemical plants for reprocessing fuel
                            elements thereby putting production of plutonium on a national basis.
                            Such production of plutonium would not in itself constitute manufacture
                            of atomic weapons but would be a long and dangerous step in this
                            direction. Therefore as a minimum of control of all six European nations
                            a supranationally controlled chemical reprocessing plant would seem to
                            be required. Also similar supranationally controlled enriching plant if
                            enrichment were to proceed to a point where U–235 was produced which
                            could be used in a weapon.</p>
                        <p>The Germans have not yet put forward a draft of their own atomic
                            legislation and there is some danger that they may leave re-processing
                                <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415" facs="0443"/>and direct production of
                            plutonium to private plants which would result in highly dangerous
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>In presenting above considerations would like to emphasize I am as
                            worried about possible production plutonium in France or Belgium as
                            about its production in Germany. What is more worrisome is the suspicion
                            which can easily be generated in a few years that plutonium in different
                            European nations will be produced on sufficient scale to produce a few
                            bombs which could be used clandestinely not by European nations but by
                            other countries in such highly explosive areas as Africa or the Middle
                                East.<note n="3" xml:id="d160fn3">In a letter to <persName

                        <p>The Department welcomes the opportunity to provide you with its views on
                            the two questions raised in your memorandum of January 31, to the

                                guidance on two matters in connection with the upcoming Ministerial

                                    (<gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>): atomic energy and

                        <p>1. There should not necessarily be conflict between the activities of the
                                <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> and those of a genuinely
                            supranational “<gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>”. <pb n="416"
                                xml:id="pg_416" facs="0444"/>We are not now able to judge whether
                            France, Germany, Italy and the <gloss target="#t_Benelux1"
                                >Benelux</gloss> countries are prepared to create institutions in
                            the field of atomic energy whose authority and responsibility would be
                            as reliable as that of a single state. If they do, the Department of
                            State and the Atomic Energy Commission would be prepared to go to the
                            Congress to ask for enabling legislation which would permit treating
                                <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> as well or better than
                            we would treat individual countries.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> is a highly successful and
                            productive agency for international economic cooperation among European
                            countries, with the United States and Canada active associates. (In the
                                <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> a supranational <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> could participate as one unit
                            on atomic energy matters.) Under present statute, (without an additional
                            treaty) it is not possible for the United States to enter into bilateral
                            atomic energy arrangements involving classified information with
                            groupings of countries. The <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> is a
                            grouping of countries which by its nature would not have the capability
                            of acting as a single state. Hence, we should plan to cooperate with it
                            actively, but only in the unclassified field of atomic energy knowledge
                            and activity. This is a very large field. The Department believes that
                            in it the United States should make as large and as valuable a
                            contribution as it can to the cooperative processes and programs of
                                <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> countries. The United States
                            Government will be entering into bilateral arrangements, of various
                            sorts, with many individual European countries, and the Department
                            believes that a supranational <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> acting as one unit in <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                                >OEEC</gloss> work would increase, rather than diminish the fruitful
                            exchanges on atomic energy matters between all cooperating <gloss
                                target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> participants.</p>
                        <p>The Department would not adopt the same attitude towards a <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> which merely called for the
                            kind of cooperative relationships now existing among <gloss

                        <p>2. We should not stand in the way of consideration by European countries
                            of the question of how they can play an active role in contributing to
                            economic growth in the under-developed areas of the world. However,
                            taking into account our previous consultations with the United Kingdom
                            on this subject, our observation of Asian sentiment as revealed in the
                            Simla meeting of the Colombo Plan countries, our doubts as to the
                            propriety of a regional organization in one area discussing problems of
                            another area not there represented, and the fact that we are not full
                            members in the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> and that some
                            influential European countries may well make points which we would
                            otherwise wish to advance, we believe that on the subject of an <gloss
                                target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> role in a development program for the
                            under-developed parts of the world we should maintain a position of
                            reserve.</p>

                        <p>We do not see great promise for fruitful consideration of economic
                            matters within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as such. We regard
                            the economic cooperation now being pursued among Atlantic Community
                            countries, in the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> and elsewhere,
                            as carrying out the intent of Article II and as enhancing effective
                            accomplishment of the objectives of the North Atlantic Treaty
                            Organization. In this way we can build up the non-military aspects of
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> without detracting from its
                            military importance.</p>

                                February 29, <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gronchi</persName> spoke

                                    >Dulles</persName> and expressed the view that U.S. support was
                                crucial for the movement toward European integration. A memorandum

                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MG1">Martino</persName> said he did not
                            want to take much of the Secretary’s time but that there were a few
                            matters he felt he should take up while in Washington. He handed the
                            Secretary a memorandum expressing the Italian Government’s interest in
                            the industrial use of nuclear energy and in the establishment of a power
                                reactor.<note n="2" xml:id="d162fn2">Not found in Department of
                                State files.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MG1">Martino</persName> said that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gronchi</persName> had talked to Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> about this during his
                            visit and the latter had said he would make appropriate recommendations.
                            The Italian Government had now decided it would like to commence
                            negotiation regarding establishment of a power reactor. The Secretary
                            said he was sure we were disposed to enter into such negotiations. He
                            said it was our desire, in making bilateral arrangements, <pb n="418"
                                xml:id="pg_418" facs="0446"/>not to interfere in any way with the
                            creation of <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> and he was glad
                            to note that the Italian memorandum took this into account.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MG1">Martino</persName> said that Italy considers
                                <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> to be an extremely
                            important development towards which the Italian Government will continue
                            to work, and he repeated what President <persName corresp="#p_GG2"
                                >Gronchi</persName> had already said in his conversations in
                            Washington to the effect that <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> can only be established with the support of the
                            United States Government. The Secretary said he was sure that <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> could count on help from more
                            than one country. He pointed out that the operation of power reactors
                            requires careful supervision and he felt that <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> would provide a more effective
                            control than could be expected from individual countries. He believed
                            that on a power basis the cost of the establishment and operation of a
                            power reactor would be very high and that it would be better for the
                            European countries to pursue this development collectively, rather than
                            individually.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MG1">Martino</persName> said that when Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> was in Washington
                            he understood that he and President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> had discussed European integration. He was
                            aware that the United Kingdom opposed the common market, a matter which
                            had just been discussed at the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>
                            Ministerial meeting in Paris. He said that the Messina recommendations
                            had a political as well as an economic goal and that the Italian
                            Government was more interested in seeing a political unity brought about
                            in Europe. He asked whether the Secretary could tell him what had
                            transpired during the <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                            discussions. The Secretary said that the two had reached no agreement.
                            The United States favors the establishment of a common market and the
                            United Kingdom does not, basing its reasoning on the alleged fact that
                            the French would insist on high tariff walls and would not participate
                            in a common market under any other conditions. We in the United States
                            do not expect that the common market would result in such a high tariff
                            policy and we feel it would eventually lead to political integration.
                            The <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>–<persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> conversation cannot be said
                            to have resulted in a change of position on either side. It is difficult
                            to estimate just how far the United Kingdom was prepared to go, but it
                            is our definite impression that while it had adopted a neutral attitude
                            toward <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>, it will continue to
                            oppose the establishment of a common market. <persName corresp="#p_MG1"
                                >Martino</persName> asked whether, in the event the common market is
                            established in the face of British opposition, the British would retire
                            from the Western European Union. The Secretary said that he could not
                            answer the question but he felt the British would not take any such
                            action. In any event, he hoped the European nations involved would go
                            forward with their plans. President <persName corresp="#p_GG2"
                                >Gronchi</persName> had mentioned several times his interest in
                            moving forward <pb n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0447"/>in this field
                            and doing something dynamic which would stimulate the interest of the
                            peoples of the Western countries. The best way to accomplish this, in
                            the Secretary’s opinion, was through European integration. Such a
                            development would create a great center of political and economic power
                            which would stir the imagination of all peoples and create a great new
                            force in the world. A real supranational authority can accomplish great
                            things.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MG1">Martino</persName> said that the great
                            difficulty in bringing about this development lay in the political
                            situation in France. <persName corresp="#p_PCP1">Pineau</persName> had
                            said that the French would not wish to push the idea of a common market
                            until after <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> were
                            established, since he felt it would be easier to obtain parliamentary
                            approval of the latter. Italy, on the other hand, wants the two to go
                            ahead in parallel, always with political integration as the ultimate
                            goal. Recently Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SA1"
                                >Segni</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MG1">Martino</persName>
                            had talked to <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> on this
                            subject and the latter had been very firm in his support, even to the
                            point of suggesting that the five nations “go it alone” without France
                            if necessary. While the five countries are fully determined to maintain
                            the momentum thus far achieved, <persName corresp="#p_MG1"
                                >Martino</persName> felt that it would be extremely difficult to
                            omit France from any planning for European integration. The Secretary
                            said that if the French were convinced that the five countries might
                            proceed without France, it might well influence them to go along.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that the U.S. would do anything within reason
                            to indicate its support for an integrated European atomic energy effort.
                            However, the U.S. was limited by the absence of any firm <gloss

                            Ambassador expressed the “preoccupation” which Mr. <persName

                            U.S.-German bilateral. The Secretary pointed out that negotiations had
                            not yet started with the Germans for nuclear power reactor information
                            or material and he expressed doubts that any such negotiation would be
                            speeded up before the 6 nations had a good chance to come up with a firm
                            joint proposal. He also pointed out that Chancellor <persName

                            community approach to atomic energy development in Europe.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the U.S. already had a bilateral arrangement with
                            Belgium and had been negotiating a long time with France for an
                            Agreement for Cooperation. He pointed out that it would not be possible
                            for the United States to suspend its present bilateral negotiations and
                            he stressed the importance of speeding up the <gloss

                            Atomic Energy Commission has undertaken a study of the action which the
                            United States could take in the field of atomic energy to encourage
                            integration of the European Community of Six.</p>
                        <p>In considering this report, the Department of State will realize that the
                            Commission is not in a position to determine the maximum technical
                            contribution which might ultimately be required to effectuate the
                            creation of the Community. However, the Commission feels that the plan
                            of assistance outlined in the attached study will offer considerable
                            encouragement to the creation of the Community and, concerning our
                            present limitations in plant capacity and availability of U–235 for
                            power and research reactor programs, may be considered the maximum
                            feasible at this time. Relative to the availability of U–235, it should
                            be noted that the recent allocation of 20,000 kg. of U–235 for foreign
                            use, as well as the Commission’s present planning for further foreign
                            allocations, is based on optimistic estimates of foreign power growth
                            and requirements.</p>
                        <p>As was indicated in the Commission’s conversation with you on January 25,
                            1956, the attached plan is forwarded as a basis for further <gloss

                            discussion. It should not be construed as committing the <gloss

                            discussions, the possible measures of assistance outlined.</p>
                        <p>The attached plan of assistance does not take into account the possible
                            need for additional legal authority which might be required to implement
                            the plan. In addition, any assistance offered in this <pb n="424"

                            <head>ACTION IN THE FIELD OF ATOMIC ENERGY TO ENCOURAGE INTEGRATION OF
                                THE COMMUNITY OF SIX</head>
                            <p>1. By memorandum of January 12, 1956 the President directed the
                                Atomic Energy Commission and the Department of State to study on an
                                urgent basis moves which the United States could make in the atomic
                                energy field to encourage the integration of the Community of Six.
                                The Community of Six, hereinafter referred to as the “Community”,
                                would include membership of Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Italy,
                                France, and West Germany in an integrated European Atomic Energy
                                organization, with supranational control over the development of
                                atomic energy in the six countries.</p>
                            <p>2. The Secretary of State has asked the <gloss target="#t_AEC1"
                                    >AEC</gloss> to consider the maximum contribution which the U.S.
                                could make to encourage the creation of an integrated atomic energy
                                community. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> has
                                also expressed the hope that the Commission consider <hi
                                    rend="italic">all</hi> possibilities, leaving for subsequent
                                    <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>–State Department
                                determination any decision as to which of the possibilities should
                                be selected as safe, prudent and wise for the United States. In
                                accordance with the terms of reference, the plan of assistance
                                presented here was drawn up without regard to limits set by
                                currently applicable laws or policies.</p>
                            <p>3. It is felt that the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> has no
                                method of determining what contribution may ultimately be required
                                to effectuate creation of the Community, inasmuch as the exact
                                details of the Community’s atomic energy project have not yet been
                                finalized. The <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>, therefore, can
                                only provide the Department of State with a broad plan of assistance
                                for the Community, which it believes would be an incentive in the
                                creation of an integrated European atomic energy industry. Such a
                                plan would then be used as background for consideration by the
                                Department of State in any negotiations with the Community.</p>
                            <p>4. It is assumed that if it is to encourage integration, the United
                                States must be prepared to show that no individual nation could <pb
                                    n="425" xml:id="pg_425" facs="0453"/>obtain more assistance from
                                the United States as an individual than as a member of the
                                Community. The United States must be prepared to extend assistance
                                and privileges to the Community equal to or greater than that now,
                                or in the future, to be extended to any one member of the Community
                                under a bilateral arrangement, with the possible exception of
                                Belgium, which has a special relation to the U.S.</p>
                            <p>5. The possible assistance that the United States Government, through
                                the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>, can render to encourage
                                European integration is considered primarily within the framework of
                                materials, information, services, and special privileges. The
                                conclusions reached as to assistance which might be provided are
                                predicated on possibilities within the limitations of present plant
                                capacity and the present projections as to quantities of U–235 (see
                                Table I below<note n="4" xml:id="d166fn4">Not printed.</note>),
                                which may be made available for power and research reactor
                                programs.</p>
                            <p>6. In developing the possible methods of assistance the staff has
                                assumed that this assistance will be tendered under an appropriate
                                agreement whereby the United States would have access to all
                                information and data developed by the Community, the consequence of
                                U.S. assistance rendered. The appropriate standing provisions of
                                existing bilateral arrangements, as well as the policy of the
                                National Security Council, will be incorporated in the proposed
                                agreement as will such other provisions deemed necessary to protect
                                the interests of the United States with respect to patents, security
                                inspections, etc.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Materials</hi></p>
                            <p>7. Under the policy announced by the President on February 22, 1956,
                                20,000 kg. of U–235 were allocated for foreign power and research
                                reactor programs. It was recognized that the initial allocation of
                                material is insufficient to maintain a large-scale power production
                                program for a long time, but is sufficient to permit the start of
                                such a program. The Commission recognized that under optimistic
                                conditions the total amount of allocated material would be in use by
                                1962 and additional amounts would have to be allocated periodically
                                thereafter. The predicted range of yearly allocations or
                                requirements for the free world, as estimated by the Commission, is
                                listed in Table I, below. As the Community of Six has presently
                                about half of the installed electrical capacity of the free world
                                (outside the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">U.K.</gloss>, and the U.S.), it
                                is the belief of the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> staff that
                                the member countries of the Community will construct well over half
                                of the nuclear generating capacity installed (outside the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UKG1">U.K.</gloss>, and U.S.) during the next ten
                                years. As a consequence, the U.S. could agree to allocate to the
                                Community an initial quantity of at least 5000 kg., but not more <pb
                                    n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0454"/>than half of the amount
                                presently allocated for foreign distribution. (Of course, the
                                amounts allocated to member countries under bilateral agreements
                                must come from the initial allocation that might otherwise be made
                                available for the Community.) Further, we can guarantee for an
                                agreed period, after the initial allocation has been delivered,
                                additional quantities for yearly delivery sufficient to sustain the
                                installed capacity resulting from the initial allocation. (This goes
                                one step beyond the Commission’s action on the 20,000 kg. and would
                                require a new Presidential allocation.) While we cannot now specify
                                the exact amount we are confident that these yearly quantities will
                                be substantial. (The staff estimates that a quantity on the order of
                                1000–2000 kg. per year would be sufficient to maintain the nuclear
                                generating capacity installed as a consequence of the initial
                                allocation, and may also permit the installation of a small
                                additional capacity.)</p>
                            <p>8. Although U–235 is the material believed to be of greatest interest
                                to the Community of Six, heavy water may also prove useful. The
                                United States is in a position to meet any reasonable requirements
                                the Community might have for heavy water and could offer to supply
                                this material. The estimated requirements of the Community would
                                have to be determined by subsequent U.S. discussions with the
                                Community.</p>
                            <p>9. Depleted uranium would be useful to the Community as a shielding
                                material or as fertile material for use in breeder reactors. The
                                U.S. has available substantial quantities of such material.
                                Reasonable quantities could therefore be made available to the
                                Community. The only limitation to such action is the present
                                classification problem. This matter is presently under study by the
                                    <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> staff and recommendation for
                                action will be made to the Commission.</p>
                            <p>10. Quantities of highly enriched U–235, plutonium, and U–233 would
                                be extremely useful to the Community in many research and
                                development programs. Agreed quantities of such materials should be
                                transferred to the Community under appropriate arrangements.</p>
                            <p>11. It is not expected that the Community will be short of natural
                                uranium. Both Belgium and metropolitan France have a source of
                                natural uranium. In view of these sources, and in view of the rather
                                substantial quantities of U–235 which could be allocated to the
                                Community, there would not appear to be any great need for an
                                outside source of natural uranium. The Community could be informed
                                that if such a need develops the U.S. would consider supplying the
                                needs to the extent it can. It is, therefore, not believed desirable
                                to make an offer of any specific quantity of natural uranium at this
                                time, as such offer might prejudice our relationship with Belgium
                                and France in the procurement of source materials.</p>
                            <pb n="427" xml:id="pg_427" facs="0455"/>
                            <p>12. It is not considered worthwhile to offer to the Community other
                                reactor materials, since such materials for a nuclear industry can
                                easily be produced in the cooperating countries in accordance with
                                any goal established for nuclear power capacity. It might be
                                worthwhile to indicate that, depending upon commercial availability,
                                other materials can be procured in the U.S. as needed.</p>

                            <p>13. The following discussion with respect to the information to be
                                transmitted to the Community is without regard to security
                                implications. It is doubtful if a satisfactory security system could
                                be developed to provide assurance that classified information
                                transmitted to the Community would not be compromised.</p>
                            <p>14. It is believed that with the guarantees proposed concerning the
                                availability of enriched uranium, the technical need for early
                                construction of a gaseous diffusion plant may be deferred. It is not
                                proposed, therefore, to make any diffusion plant technology
                                available, since existing legislation does not permit the release of
                                classified gaseous diffusion technology and the extent of
                                unclassified information in this field would be of inconsequential
                                value to the <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> Group.
                                Political considerations may outweigh technical considerations and
                                the Community may still propose to construct a gaseous diffusion
                                plant. It may be that the opportunity to be a part owner in a
                                gaseous diffusion plant will be a greater incentive to the
                                integration of the atomic energy effort than any other single
                                factor. It is, therefore, proposed that the U.S. do nothing which
                                will prevent the Community from constructing a gaseous diffusion
                                plant if desired.</p>
                            <p>15. In a power reactor complex, feed materials production centers,
                                fuel fabrication plants, and chemical recovery and separation plants
                                would be necessary. The United States could agree to exchange all
                                technology, presently classified “confidential”, as well as
                                unclassified information, covering the design, construction and
                                operation of such plants except that no data revealing special
                                nuclear material production rates in the United States would be
                                exchanged. The U.S. could also permit the Community to reprocess
                                fuel made available to the Community under a bilateral agreement. It
                                is felt that the importance of providing chemical separation
                                technology, as well as permitting the Community to reprocess fuel
                                elements provided by the U.S. to it and to other European countries
                                cannot be over-emphasized. This comprises a major part of any
                                nuclear power complex and would be one of the most important
                                contributions the U.S. could make to encourage integration of the
                                Community.</p>
                            <p>16. The Community proposes the establishment of a common laboratory
                                and center for basic research, and reactor development. As an
                                incentive to the establishment of the Community, we could agree <pb
                                    n="428" xml:id="pg_428" facs="0456"/>to permit cooperation and
                                the exchange of all power reactor technology (classified
                                “confidential” or less) on all power reactor concepts restricting
                                however any exchange on military reactor systems.</p>
                            <p>17. The United States could propose to effectuate this exchange of
                                information and give assistance in the following manner: <list>

                            <p>18. With regard to financial assistance, it is understood that the
                                member countries of the Community of Six have a sufficient amount of
                                funds available to initiate the Community program. Further, the
                                Export-Import Bank, the International Bank for Reconstruction and
                                Development and private lending institutions would be in a position
                                to provide financial assistance to the Community. It is felt that an
                                offer of financial assistance is outside the purview of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> but should be taken into
                                consideration by the State Department. If the proposed Community
                                development program is of a quality of sufficient interest to the
                                United States, this country could agree to contract for the
                                performance of specific sub-programs or services on our behalf by

                                    (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, Documents)</note>). He commented
                            that the proposed loan had been discussed with the Department of State
                            during the summer of 1955, and that no objection had been raised at that
                            time. Meanwhile negotiations with the Thyssen Company had proceeded
                            actively. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> noted that
                            the <gloss target="#t_EXIMBank1">Eximbank</gloss> had been attempting
                            for some time to enter the German market. He felt that in the context of
                            the European steel industry the proposed loan was too small to offer an
                            effective means of raising objections to the European steel export
                            cartel.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> stated that the
                            Department of State had no objection to the credit itself, but wished to
                            bring the cartel question to the attention of the Council. State
                            understood that the German Government was attempting to take action
                            against the cartel, and would not be likely to object to denial of this
                            loan. He commented that national cartels are illegal under the Coal and
                            Steel Community treaty, and that while the High Authority of the <gloss
                                target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> had indicated its disapproval of the
                            export cartel, it had only limited authority to act against this sort of
                            arrangement.</p>
                        <p>The Council discussed the proposed credit and the questions raised with
                            respect to the cartel aspects. It was pointed out that the <pb n="431"
                                xml:id="pg_431" facs="0459"/>Thyssen firm was exporting very little
                            steel and that the credit would assist in the expansion of the
                            production of types of steel for which there was great demand within
                            Germany rather than for export. For this reason and because of the small
                            amount of the credit in relation to the magnitude of the European steel
                            industry, the possible cartel implications of the credit had not
                            appeared significant to the <gloss target="#t_EXIMBank1"
                                >Eximbank</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The negotiations with the prospective borrower were described in
                            considerable detail. The Council agreed that while it would have been
                            desirable for the cartel question to have been considered early in the
                            negotiations, under the existing circumstances no objection should be
                            raised to the credit.</p>
                        <p>It was also agreed that the Bank should inform the Thyssen firm that the
                            cartel aspects of the credit had created considerable difficulties
                            within the U.S. Government, and that it would be appropriate for the
                            U.S. Embassy in Germany to make it clear to the German Government that
                            the United States hoped that the German Government’s anti-cartel efforts
                            would be successful and that the credit was granted solely to promote
                            the modernization of German steel producing facilities.</p>
                        <p>The following action was taken (<gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>
                            Action No. 875): <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    be repayable over a period of approximately 15 years, including

                                            conclusion that a moral commitment on this credit had
                                            been made and <persName corresp="#p_BWR1">Randy

                            order that the Congress might be properly informed beforehand. He
                            intended to follow this practice again in the announcement under
                            consideration. This meant that the statement would probably have to be
                            made before the middle of June inasmuch as Congress would probably
                            adjourn early, due to the forthcoming election.</p>

                                >Strauss</persName> indicated to M. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1"
                                >Monnet</persName> privately that in case <gloss

                            United States’ intention to allocate certain amounts of material to it.
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> wondered whether

                                >Euratom</gloss> should not be made as part of his statement on
                            U–235 release, and asked for M. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1"
                                >Monnet</persName>’s private opinion on the matter. M. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> asked for time to consider the
                            matter and a meeting was arranged for April 28.</p>

                            <item>The question was reopened at the beginning of the April 28th
                                meeting. In replying M. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName>
                                stated that in his personal opinion it would be difficult for public
                                opinion at this time to understand why the U.S. would allocate
                                materials to <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss> before the
                                latter had been formed. He was afraid that the public might conclude
                                that pressure was being brought to bear on Europe by the United
                                States in order to cause <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >Euratom</gloss>’s coming into being. Since <gloss
                                    target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss>’s formation was primarily a
                                matter for Europeans to decide by themselves, M. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> advised the Chairman to await
                                a later date before <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0461"/>making
                                the announcement. M. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName>
                                was fully cognizant of the desirability of informing the Congress,
                                but he felt that any announcement should follow the raising of the
                                question by the <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss> powers
                                rather than precede it. It was possible that <gloss
                                    target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss> could raise such questions
                                after the May 29th Ministerial meeting but one really should wait
                                for the outcome of that meeting before reaching a conclusion.</item>

                                    >Euratom</gloss> in the weapons problem. The Chairman agreed
                                that any decision on weapons necessarily raises difficult problems
                                for every country.</item>

                            <item><p>M. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> raised the
                                    question of ownership versus leasing of fissionable materials
                                    and the bearing which this had on the current <gloss
                                        target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss> negotiations. He
                                    expressed the view that material should be sold to <gloss
                                        target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss> by the United States
                                    for subsequent leasing to the various users. He also remarked
                                    that it was very important that inspection and control
                                    requirements, which would undoubtedly be required by U.S. law,
                                    should be exercised by <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                        >Euratom</gloss> itself. M. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1"
                                        >Monnet</persName> went on to explain that allotment of
                                    material by <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss> itself
                                    would be made not to countries but to individual public and
                                    private users. In case of infringement or diversion by any such
                                    groups, recourse would be had to the international court set up
                                    as part of the <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss>
                                    organizational framework. Decisions of this court were
                                    obligatory on national courts.</p>
                                <p>With regard to the problem of ownership, the Chairman remarked
                                    that the matter would have to be considered in the light of U.S.
                                    policy toward U.S. industry. It would, of course, be impossible
                                    to consider putting European industry in any preferred position
                                    over U.S. industry. With regard to the court handling of
                                    infringements or diversions, the court set up would seem like a
                                    satisfactory solution.</p></item>

                            <item>In closing, the Chairman raised the question as to whether the
                                formation of <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss> might not
                                in fact mean the socialization of the atomic industry in Europe. M.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> replied that such
                                would not be the case. <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss>
                                cannot in any sense affect either the property rights or laws
                                existing in several countries, nor can it influence the relation
                                between public and private enterprises in the States. <gloss
                                    target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss> had in fact two purposes
                                which were far removed from ideas of socialization; <gloss
                                    target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss>’s primary objectives were
                                (1) to stimulate and ensure European atomic development on a
                                sufficiently broad base to allow furnishing such needs of the area
                                as could not be done nationally and, (2) to furnish a satisfactory
                                mechanism whereby fissionable material would be subjected to the
                                necessary security controls.</item>

                            the German political situation. This portion of the memorandum of

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ECB1">Elbrick</persName> said that the United
                            States Government is fully prepared to offer its support to a <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> project with common
                            responsibility and authority, which could make a real contribution in
                            the political and economic sense. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ECB1"
                                >Elbrick</persName> said the Department was glad the German
                            Government and the Chancellor are supporting <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> indicated that he had
                            heard two apparently conflicting American views, favoring <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> and the <gloss
                                target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> project. At the <gloss
                                target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> Conference, he had clear statements
                            in favor of <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The German Government would like to combine the two approaches, i.e.,
                            have <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> as part of the <gloss
                                target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> approach. They would not like to have
                            the British left out. Without them <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> would consist of five blinds and one half-blind
                            (which he identified as France).</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> expressed the fear
                            that socialism would arise out of <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss>. What <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Jean
                                Monnet</persName> proposed (agency possession and <pb n="436"
                                xml:id="pg_436" facs="0464"/>monopoly of the purchase of nuclear
                            fuel, agency power to permit or veto plant designs, and the elimination
                            of bilateral treaties between individual member states and non-members)
                            was absolutely unacceptable to the German Cabinet and parliament, and
                            this extreme should not be pressed. The April report had been more
                            moderate. <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brentano</persName> had been
                            authorized to open negotiations on the basis of this report. This did
                            not mean the German Cabinet approves all aspects of the report, however.
                            It is a basis of negotiation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1"
                                >Strauss</persName> mentioned the following difficulties: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>Military Use: He would not wish to see all Europe abandon
                                    military use. This has nothing to do with Germany. In any case,
                                    weapons should not be produced by one Western European nation
                                    alone. However, it would encourage Moscow and might eventually
                                    become a means for neutralization. Mr. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said he did not want
                                    raw material divided into civilian and military use and did not
                                    want research and technical secrets treated differently, e.g.
                                    withheld from the partners in <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"

                                        >Strauss</persName> said he did not want partial
                                    integration; he wanted a link to the next stage of a general
                                    common market. He realized the common market could not be fully
                                    achieved at once. To insist on realization of the common market
                                    now as a condition for <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                        >EURATOM</gloss> would be to sabotage <gloss

                                    believe there should be some sort of real step toward a common
                                    market. If there were no such step in connection with <gloss
                                        target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>, the common market
                                    would never be accomplished.</item>

                                    purchasing, but not forbid bilateral purchases.</item>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHL1">Krekeler</persName> said that
                                <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> should have an attitude
                            toward private enterprise not less favorable than that of the United
                            States, giving as much freedom to private enterprise as is consistent
                            with security.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ECB1">Elbrick</persName> said that we did not
                            see why <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> should have
                            socialistic results. The United States has a strong Commission with
                            strong controls, and it is developing a private program.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said that <gloss
                                target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> is part of the United States
                            Government. He would favor a strong <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> without objections if it were a part of the
                            government of a United States of Europe. Otherwise, he thought it
                            necessary to maintain freedom for enterprise. He was willing to agree to
                            any controls necessary to safety, but not to control of the building of
                            plants. He indicated a fear that the result would be undue control of
                            Germany in the interest of one or more of her partners.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ECB1">Elbrick</persName> stressed the need of
                            adequate authority to maintain security controls. He said that the
                            United States could cooperate more closely with a <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> with adequate authority than
                            with the member countries bilaterally. In response to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>’ question <pb n="437"
                                xml:id="pg_437" facs="0465"/>as to whether bilateral relations would
                            be excluded, he said that we believe United States cooperation with such
                            an authority could far exceed that which could be given
                            individually.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHL1">Krekeler</persName> reviewed the
                            German attitude toward <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>,
                            which he described as not reluctance to move toward integration, but
                            wishing to do it the right way.<note n="3" xml:id="d170fn3">Shortly

                            integration in the field of atomic energy. Herr Strauss at first merely
                            reiterated many of the same points regarding <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> that he had already made at the 10 o’clock meeting

                                    countries to proceed with a common market, but rather that the

                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> stated that the
                            German Government now has its atomic program laid out. Plans for atomic
                            research and research reactors are now underway. Germany must regain the
                            lost ten to fifteen years and hopes within six or seven years to be able
                            to compete with Great Britain and France in the peaceful use of atomic
                            energy. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHL1">Krekeler</persName> added
                            that Minister <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> has come
                            with a desire to place three orders with American firms for research
                            reactors, has brought a German draft law on atomic energy, and hopes to
                            arrange for training German technicians in the U.S.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that it might be some years before the use of
                            atomic energy became commercially profitable. Some people <pb n="439"
                                xml:id="pg_439" facs="0467"/>are over-optimistic in this respect. Of
                            course, atomic energy for power has been proved to be technically
                            feasible, but refinements are necessary before general commercial use
                            will be profitable. One cannot operate on a profitable basis now except
                            in a few spots in the world where production costs of other sources of
                            energy are relatively high. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1"
                                >Smith</persName> added that it was anticipated that within fifteen
                            years Western Europe could produce atomic energy on a commercial basis
                            whereas in some areas of very high cost power production of atomic
                            energy might already be commercial today.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> estimated future
                            German atomic energy requirements as follows: As of 1954, German
                            electrical energy use was 70 billion kilowatt hours. By 1970 Germany
                            would use 170 billion kilowatt hours. The estimate is based upon an
                            assumption of 5% expansion in the economy annually. 145 billion kilowatt
                            hours of the requirements of 1970 could be met by usual sources of power
                            but the additional 25 billion kilowatt hours must presumably come from
                            atomic power. 1970 is only fourteen years away. Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> expressed interest in the
                            20,000 kilogram program of the President. The Secretary stated that the
                            quantity for countries might vary but the conditions would be the same
                            for all. Detailed procedures were being worked out.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> mentioned that
                            the German Government had already the draft of the <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> Treaty to be presented at the
                            meeting of the Six Foreign Ministers on May 29 in Venice. At the meeting
                            Germany would prefer not to face the alternative of only an <gloss
                                target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> or a <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> organization. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1"
                                >Strauss</persName> recalled the statements by Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> at the <gloss
                                target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> Ministerial meeting in Paris in
                            February 1956 favoring both the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>, indicating that they
                            could be combined and that a political solution would be necessary.
                            Germany certainly does not want to leave Britain outside. It would be
                            good to have Britain associated with <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> as a “broker”.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that the US looks with favor on whatever projects
                            tend most effectively toward a unified Europe. If one were to ask why,
                            he would point out that the President had tried to give the answer by
                            saying that the divisions within Western Europe have brought Western
                            society close to the point of extinction. Recurrent wars have killed off
                            some of the finest men, brought the economy to frequent ruin and torn
                            down Europe’s moral stature. The greatest task confronting post-war
                            statesmen is to reconstruct Europe on a more permanent basis. There is
                            no other way which will leave anything left at all in Europe.</p>
                        <p>Formerly the US was not concerned but we are now involved. Two world wars
                            have cost us something and we are entitled to have some interest in the
                            matter. The Secretary stated that the US understands <pb n="440"
                                xml:id="pg_440" facs="0468"/>that dictation to European countries
                            would be counter-productive but as members of the Western Community, we
                            are entitled to have some views. We had lost hundreds of thousands of
                            men and hundreds of billions of dollars as a result of wars starting in
                            Europe. We cannot sit aside and say nothing while the structure which
                            has been the world’s greatest war hazard is being rebuilt. Dictation is
                            bad but an attitude of indifference would also be a false approach. The
                            sympathy and support of the US will go to that program best calculated
                            to draw together the Western European countries. It doesn’t matter
                            whether the plan is political, economic, or of other form. One will
                            recall that the recent Council of Ministers of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> at Paris agreed that ways should be explored to draw
                            European nations more closely together. Whatever can be done within
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is fine, but sometimes smaller
                            groups are useful to accomplish particular purposes. The President’s
                            speech in London in 1951 on European reunification indicates the
                            conclusions Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> had
                            drawn before he became President.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the more European nations try to work together,
                            the more we can help them.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said that he knew
                            the Secretary’s position on assistance to an integrated community of
                            countries, that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJB1">Conant</persName>
                            had presented to the German Government an Aide-Mémoire on the
                                subject.<note n="2" xml:id="d172fn2">Apparent reference to the
                                aide-mémoire presented by <persName corresp="#p_CJB1"
                                    >Conant</persName> upon the instructions of the Department; see
                                    <ref target="#d164">Document 164</ref>.</note> In proceeding
                            toward European unity certain achievements could already be listed, such
                            as the Coal and Steel Community. Germany would like now to combine the
                            two next steps, <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> and the
                            common market. Of course, the German Government realizes that whoever
                            demands the common market immediately as a condition for <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> would sabotage <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> because it would not be
                            acceptable but real integration necessitates economic integration, and
                            it must be followed by military and political integration. The German
                            Cabinet decided to say yes at Venice for <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> but also to require that the countries represented
                            take the first step toward a common market. Whoever wants <gloss

                            create a common market. The German Government expects that it will take
                            twelve to fifteen years to achieve a common market, nevertheless a first
                            step must be made and carried out simultaneously with <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>. There would be many
                            difficulties in the German Cabinet and in the German Parliament in
                            approving <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> if there is no
                            link with the common market.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that the US is all in favor of the common market
                            idea. The Preamble of the Marshall Plan spoke of a <pb n="441"
                                xml:id="pg_441" facs="0469"/>common market in Europe. With the
                            common market Europe would be a third world force along with the US and
                            the Soviet Union. If Europe does not have a common market, it will
                            remain weak. It maintains itself at present by a cartel system with
                            artificial markets and high costs. On the other hand, if a common market
                            is made an absolute condition for unity in atomic power development,
                            Europe may end up with nothing.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that Minister <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1"
                                >Strauss</persName> might think that controls required in <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> would destroy free enterprise,
                            but we do not think so. There is no reason why <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> should be socialistic. The
                            problem is how to have controls to insure that atomic energy is being
                            used for peaceful purposes. Because of the by-product of plutonium, the
                            efficacy of controls will be most important. It is our thought that the
                            larger and more responsible the safeguard organization the more control
                            will be facilitated. This would be better than multiple controls of many
                            individual countries involving complicated policing. It is appalling to
                            contemplate a multiplicity of uncontrolled national atomic developments
                            leading to multiplying atomic weapons programs. If you set up a pattern
                            allowing the thing to spread on national lines there will be the danger
                            of irresponsible action. While certain nations are capable of the
                            responsibility there are other places in the world without the necessary
                            sense.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName>Strauss</persName> commented that he agreed with the
                            Secretary that there should be a common market, an exchange of
                            information on atomic developments, joint research programs,
                            standardization and all kinds of control through registration, but that
                            the German Government does not want to see <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> own fissionable materials, have a purchase
                            monopoly, nor does it want to compel exchange of patent information. The
                            German Government would feel differently about <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> if the European counterpart of
                            the Atomic Energy Commission were an instrument of a European
                            Government. However, without a European Government a European Atomic
                            Commission like that of the US would be bad. The Secretary commented
                            that <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> would constitute such a

                            between possible amendment of the bilateral agreement on the one hand
                            and the multilateral negotiation on <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> on the other. You will recall that in discussing

                                >Alger</persName> made clear our view that the United States
                            Government could make available substantially greater resources and
                            adopt an attitude of substantially greater liberality towards a real

                            authority than would be possible for countries separately.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State and the Atomic Energy Commission have now
                            reviewed the situation in the light of the considerations outlined in
                            your letter. We would agree, as proposed in your final paragraph, that

                            the question of whether such studies and possibly further technical
                            discussion should be developed into negotiations for the amendment and
                            clarification of the existing U.S.-Belgian agreement. In this bilateral
                            framework we believe particular attention should be paid at this time to
                            the problems raised by your numbered points 1. and 2., and to ways of
                            clarifying certain clauses of the existing agreement. I am sure that,
                            should negotiations be decided on, there will be no obstacles to
                            mutually satisfactory agreement.</p>
                        <p>I believe your suggestion offers the best possibility of reconciling the
                            problems which we both face during this period to the advantage of
                            relations between our two countries and of the common work in which we

                            communiqué issued on May 30, “noted that the six Governments agreed to
                            take the proposals contained in this Report as a basis for negotiations,
                            to be pursued with a view to drafting a treaty establishing a Common

                            nuclear energy. They decided to convene for this purpose a conference

                        <p>At dinner we had some discussion about <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> with the Chancellor and also with <persName

                            whom the Chancellor referred some of my questions. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> said that they were afraid that

                            a way that it would promote socialism. He favored the idea in principle,
                            but did not want it to operate to socialize industry in Europe.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HW1">Hallstein</persName> said that on this
                            account they had felt compelled to make a reservation at the Venice
                            meeting. He felt that the agency should not retain ownership, but should
                            exercise all the controls that could be exercised if there were
                            ownership.</p>

                        <p>I spoke of the relationship of <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> to the common market and said that while the United
                            States favored both developments, it did not seem to us wise to
                            condition one upon the other. I felt that each step could be taken on
                            its own merits and that the creation of <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> would of itself maintain a momentum favorable to

                            seemed to indicate acceptance of this view, but somewhat confusedly.</p>

                        <p>The Department has been reviewing developments in the Community relating
                            to the cartel problem. Even though the High Authority has taken some
                            significant actions against cartels (e.g. breakup of <gloss
                                target="#t_GEORG1">GEORG</gloss>), there are major areas about which
                            we continue to be concerned, namely, the national steel cartels and the
                            steel export cartel. <pb n="449" xml:id="pg_449" facs="0477"/>As you
                            know, the Council on Foreign Economic Policy (<persName
                                corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> Council) has also been concerned
                            about the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> cartel problem and had
                            this matter under review twice in 1955. We believe the time has now come
                            to talk with President <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> on an
                            informal but frank basis about the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>
                            cartel problem along the following lines.</p>
                        <p>The Department is concerned about the lack of action against the national
                            steel cartels because it is our belief that if the Community is to
                            attain its goal of the establishment of a common market operating under
                            “normal conditions of competition”, effective action must be taken under
                            the Treaty’s anti-cartel provisions in the near future against these
                            restrictive arrangements. Further, the continued operation of the steel
                            cartels tends to color the attitude of some observers in the U.S.
                            concerning the positive gains toward the development of a free common
                            market for coal and steel. Restrictive arrangements in the domestic
                            steel market apparently have been operative since the common market for
                            steel was established in May 1953. Since that time no action has been
                            taken against these arrangements and the problem will become more acute
                            the longer effective action is postponed. With the present sellers’
                            market, it would seem that this is an exceedingly propitious time to
                            proceed against the national steel cartels.</p>
                        <p>Another aspect of the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> cartel problem
                            which continues to cause concern here is the Brussels export cartel. For
                            your information, we are aware that the domestic cartel problem has
                            priority and therefore we have no specific time in mind about High
                            Authority action with respect to the export cartel. However, we do feel
                            that this matter should be called to the attention of President
                                <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> lest our silence for the
                            past several months be interpreted as acquiescence or lack of interest
                            in the activities of the export group. Much of the criticism of the
                            Community in the United States is based on the belief that ultimately
                            the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> will prove to be a reincarnation
                            of the prewar international steel cartel. The continued existence of the
                            steel export cartel lends weight to this belief. Further, the operations
                            of the cartel during the past three years have tended to be a source of
                            friction between the Community and third countries as evidenced by the
                            discussion on export prices and the export cartel in the Ninth and Tenth
                            Sessions of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. Whether the high
                            export prices are the result of collusive agreement by the producers or
                            are the consequence of continued strong demand in world markets is
                            beside the point. The fact is that the export agreement has come to be
                            identified as the principal determinant of world steel prices. Finally,
                            the steel export agreement is an example of the manner in which the
                                <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> producers may act in concert to
                            the detriment of outsiders. The combined power represented by the
                            producers of the six <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> Member States
                            acting in agreement places the individual steel importing countries <pb
                                n="450" xml:id="pg_450" facs="0478"/>at a distinct disadvantage.
                            Such agreements serve to undermine the confidence of outside countries
                            that the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> Treaty and other European
                            projects of economic integration are benign instruments which will serve
                            to encourage international trade.</p>

                                <p>The United States has generally opposed preferential arrangements
                                    in international trade because of the discrimination against the
                                    trade of third countries which they involve. The United States
                                    has taken a different and generally favorable attitude, however,
                                    toward customs unions and free-trade areas, since both involve,
                                    in addition to discrimination against the trade of third
                                    countries, the elimination of restrictions on substantially all
                                    of the trade among the participating countries, thereby making
                                    possible the more efficient allocation of economic resources
                                    among the participating countries with a consequent over-all
                                    expansion of international trade.</p>
                                <p>The United States support of such arrangements as the <gloss
                                        target="#t_Benelux1">Benelux</gloss> Economic Union and the
                                    Nicaragua–El Salvador Free Trade Area is based on this appraisal
                                    of their potentialities.</p>
                                <p>The United States opposes preferential arrangements involving a
                                    system of selective competition. These are arrangements which
                                    protect individual industries against competition from third
                                    countries and also against competition on the common internal
                                    market of the countries party to the arrangement. Such
                                    arrangements cannot by their nature contribute to the United
                                    States objective of expanding <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451"

                                    particular, and often important industries, within the
                                    preference area against all sources of competition, thereby
                                    distorting the flow of international trade, rather than
                                    expanding it.</p>
                                <p>The United States opposition to preferential arrangements which
                                    do not involve the elimination of restrictions on substantially
                                    all of the trade of the participating countries has also been
                                    modified to some extent by a willingness to accept such
                                    arrangements where they contribute to the attainment of United
                                    States political or economic objectives in a particular area.
                                    Thus, this country supported a waiver under the General
                                    Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which made possible the
                                    establishment of the preferential trading arrangements limited
                                    to coal and steel among the six countries of the European Coal
                                    and Steel Community. Its position with respect to the ECSC was
                                    based on the desirability of encouraging the closer political
                                    integration of Western Europe and the opportunity which the
                                    supranational institutions of the ECSC offered for such
                                    integration.</p>
                                <p>Thus, the attitude of the United States toward proposals for
                                    regional preference arrangements is based on an evaluation of
                                    the extent to which the arrangement will contribute to the
                                    attainment of United States political and other objectives in a
                                    particular area and a higher level of international trade.</p>
                                <p>It is in the light of these considerations that the results of
                                    the common market negotiations will be evaluated.</p></item>

                                    the recommendation to include agriculture in the project, the
                                    attention given to the international obligations of the
                                    participating countries, and the open-ended <pb n="452"

                                    membership arrangement making possible the admission of new
                                    countries. We appreciate the fact that various gaps in the
                                    report reflect the need to avoid getting bogged down in
                                    negotiating details and offending national sensitivities on such
                                    questions as institutions. In sum, we believe the common market
                                    report represents a basis on which further progress may be
                                    made.</p></item>

                        <p>The Department desires to be kept informed of the evolution of the common

                                    <p>While the 12–15 year period for the attainment of the common
                                        market appears reasonable in view of the magnitude of the
                                        task, the long period envisaged contains the risk of the
                                        project sagging or collapsing as national and international
                                        political patterns change, original suporters leave the
                                        scene and the international trade picture alters. The risk
                                        is increased as the dismantlement of national protective
                                        devices reaches sensitive economic areas and critical stages
                                        at which time the demand from affected groups for a
                                        “stand-still” on further integration could evoke
                                        considerable support, particularly if coupled with a period
                                        of economic recession.</p>
                                    <p>Therefore, it would appear to be most important that the
                                        irreversibility concept in the report be maintained and be
                                        buttressed by institutional arrangements assuring to the
                                        maximum extent possible the automatic dismantling of the
                                        six-country barriers without the necessity for new
                                        decisions. The Intergovernmental Committee Report is not
                                        clear on how this can be done. We are particularly concerned
                                        by the fact that the Intergovernmental Committee Report does
                                        not appear to provide for effective institutions capable of
                                        acting independently of national governments in the
                                        coordination of domestic economic policies, and that such
                                        bodies as the Council of Ministers and the European
                                        Commission might not be able to withstand domestic,
                                        economic, and parliamentary pressures for slowing down the
                                        dismantling of trade barriers among the six
                                    countries.</p></item>

                                        will actually be integrated into the common market.
                                        Specifically, we are interested in the arrangements which

                        <p>M. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> expressed the view that
                            the debate and vote had given an enormous boost to the prospects for
                            drafting significant six country treaties on <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> and the common market. He mentioned, in particular,
                            the speeches of M. <persName corresp="#p_MG2">Mollet</persName> and M.
                                <persName>Armand</persName>. The <pb n="454" xml:id="pg_454"
                                facs="0482"/><persName corresp="#p_MG2">Mollet</persName> speech, he
                            felt, would give to the French Delegation at Brussels a negotiating
                            flexibility permitting advances substantially beyond the concepts
                            contained in the <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> Report.
                            The <persName>Armand</persName> speech was a tour de force of
                            illumination and clarification. From it many deputies got their first
                            real understanding of the elements of promise and danger involved in
                            developing an atomic art. M. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1"
                                >Monnet</persName> summed up by saying that France should no longer
                            be regarded as constituting the real block to atomic integration.</p>
                        <p>The real problem, M. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName>
                            declared, was now to be found in Germany. And, the heart of that problem
                            lay in the political and industrial interests arguing among themselves
                            on the issue of ownership of nuclear materials. If the United States
                            wished, at this stage, to make a contribution to resolution,
                            constructively, of this controversy, it should find an appropriate
                            occasion for making the simple declaration to the Germans that—whether
                            in a <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> bilateral or a national
                            bilateral—the United States would require that title to U.S. provided
                            nuclear materials would be taken and held by an authority comparable to
                            our <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>, competent and capable of
                            performing on that undertaking. M. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1"
                                >Monnet</persName> said that he was not suggesting that the United
                            States should say more. The Germans should, themselves, weigh the
                            relative advantages of joining or not joining <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>. But the Germans should not be
                            left in doubt as to United States unwillingness to enter into bilateral
                            arrangements which would permit the German Government to turn over title
                            to nuclear material to private industrial interests.</p>
                        <p>M. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> said that he believed
                            that the interest of the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> in atomic
                            energy matters had not, in any way, increased difficulties lying in the
                            path of Six Country atomic integration. The British had, perhaps, tried
                            to confuse issues in the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> context,
                            but this would have happened whether or not the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                                >OEEC</gloss> discussions were going forward. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> did, however, question the wisdom
                            of the speed and extent of the U.S. bilateral program. He understood
                            fully the logic of saying that, for example, the U.S.–Netherlands
                            bilateral did not conflict with future U.S.–<gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> bilateral arrangements because the U.S. could do
                            more with the latter than the former. This was, M. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> suggested, “French logic”,
                            because nothing at all could be done with <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> until it existed. The conclusion of the bilaterals
                            raised profound doubts in many influential quarters as to whether it was
                            necessary to bring <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> into
                            existence.</p>
                        <p>Without elaboration, M. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> said
                            that the French atomic military program is a myth. There is, therefore,
                            no substantial reason why, at least for the foreseeable period, any
                            French interests will be injured by creation of a <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> devoted to peaceful purposes.
                            M. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> went on to say that,
                            taking the very long view, he was convinced that there was certain to be
                            a U.S.–U.S.S.R. Atomic Agreement, <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455"

                                    continuing erosion. In the course of its Assembly debate the
                                    French Government committed itself to support a four-year
                                    moratorium before any bomb could be exploded by one of the
                                    participating states but after that time any one of the six
                                    nations would be free to act unilaterally in this area (the

                                    integrated atomic energy program. One suggestion put forward is

                                The six nations are aware of our readiness to enter into technical
                                discussions with them. While all of the participating states have

                                particularly for the discreet manner in which this support has been
                                demonstrated, they have let it be understood that they do not wish

                                developed. While this decision on the part of the Brussels Group is
                                awkward in that it may result in an instrument containing provisions

                        <p>The Secretary welcomed <persName>M. Sergent</persName> and spoke of the
                            deep interest of the United States Government in the work of the
                            Organization, and in particular in the projected study of relations
                            between the proposed common market and the free trade area. He recalled
                            that he had had the privilege of attending on one of the Ministerial
                            meetings of the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p><persName>M. Sergent</persName> responded that he greatly appreciated the
                            opportunity of talking for a few minutes with the Secretary regarding
                            recent developments in the work of the Organization, which he found most
                            encouraging.</p>
                        <p>Turning first to the proposal for the creation, through the <gloss
                                target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>, of a broad free trade area,
                            including the United Kingdom, grouped around the Six-Country Common
                            Market now under discussion in Brussels, M. <persName>Sergent</persName>
                            said he personally was convinced that the proposal was not a device on
                            the part of the British to gain time. He <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465"
                                facs="0493"/>said that the first cracks in the British position
                            opposing an enlarged free trade area in Europe came in the early months
                            of this year. Several of the leading newspapers in the United Kingdom
                            had addressed themselves to the matter. M. Sergent said that he thought
                            that Mr. <persName>Thornycroft</persName>, President of the Board of
                            Trade, now sincerely believes that British association with a free trade
                            area in Europe would be greatly to the United Kingdom’s advantage, and
                            other members of the British Cabinet are increasingly favorable to the
                            idea. M. <persName>Sergent</persName> went on to say that previously
                            there had existed a danger that the Six Countries, if they formed a
                            common market, would then have proceeded to deal on a bilateral basis
                            with the other <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> countries. This
                            would have been most unfortunate, and he thought this danger had now
                            greatly lessened owing to the more positive British approach to the free
                            trade area now under discussion.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that at the time of Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s visit to Washington last
                            January, it had been quite clear that while the British Government was
                            prepared to tolerate <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>, it was
                            quite hostile to the Common Market. It appeared to him that the British
                            Government was now approaching the question of the common market and a
                            free trade area in a much more objective way, and that there had been a
                            considerable shift in British thinking on the matter.</p>
                        <p>M. <persName>Sergent</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                                >OEEC</gloss> study regarding the creation of the free trade area is
                            now just getting under way, under the direction of <persName>Baron
                                Snoy</persName>, a high permanent official of the Belgian Government
                            dealing with trade matters, who has participated in the work of the
                                <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> from the beginning and who is
                            also a member of the Belgian Delegation to the Six-Country talks in
                            Brussels on the common market. M. <persName>Sergent</persName> said he
                            felt that the fact <persName>Baron Snoy</persName> is heading the study
                            is a very good omen for the future of the discussions concerning the
                            free trade area, as he believes in both the common market and in the
                            association with it of a free trade area. It was of course too early to
                            say what the outcome would be, but he remained extremely hopeful. He
                            added he was conscious that the U.S. was watching developments closely,
                            and that it was important that the free trade area not become a device
                            for discriminating against the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the question of the work of the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                                >OEEC</gloss> in the field of nuclear energy, M.
                                <persName>Sergent</persName> recounted briefly some of the
                            developments that had given the appearance of incompatibility between
                                <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> and the <gloss
                                target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> initiative in the nuclear energy
                            field. He said that while several “peace treaties” had been signed
                            earlier, it was not until the July 1956 <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                                >OEEC</gloss> Ministerial meeting that there was a full realization
                            of the compatibility of the two initiatives. The representatives of the
                            Six had been particularly helpful at the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                                >OEEC</gloss>
                            <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0494"/>meeting. He went on to speak of
                            the hope of the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> to associate
                            private capital in whatever projects it proves possible to undertake in

                            views this subject along following general lines:</p>
                        <p>I understand problem of ownership of fissionable material will be one of
                            major issues on <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> at
                            forthcoming Ministers <pb n="468" xml:id="pg_468" facs="0496"/>Meeting
                            in Paris. While Chancellor is aware that we have carefully refrained
                            from injecting our views into Brussels discussions, this particular
                            subject is one on which U.S. has significant experience and which is of
                            such importance that he may permit us a few observations:</p>
                        <p>Despite deep commitment of U.S. to private enterprise system, there is
                            general acceptance in U.S. of necessity for government ownership of this
                            material. This policy in U.S. stems from inherent danger of fuel as well
                            as its intrinsic military significance. I understand it is sometimes
                            held that our policy on this subject is carried over from the period
                            when the primary emphasis in nuclear policy was military; this is of
                            course not so. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954, which was drafted after a
                            searching reexamination of nuclear energy policies by the Administration
                            and the Congress, in view emerging peaceful development of the atom,
                            contains a clear expression of government and Congressional policy that
                            the government should be the exclusive owner of fissionable
                            materials.</p>
                        <p>As Chancellor knows, we also have the hope that with development of
                            treaty and establishment of strong <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> with effective common authority and responsibility
                            would be possible for U.S. to cooperate very closely with atomic energy
                            community of Six. However, in view of our own domestic U.S. legislation
                            could not transfer fissionable material to <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> unless latter were in position maintain ownership
                            of material.</p>
                        <p>In light of these considerations, it is my hope that in reviewing German
                            position on ownership and supply issue, Chancellor will modify previous
                            German opposition to common ownership, in interests both of progress
                            European integration and of rapid atomic energy development in six
                            countries, including Germany.<note n="3" xml:id="d188fn3">Ambassador

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I was tremendously
                            interested in your cogent remarks this morning about the common market
                            concept for Europe.<note n="2" xml:id="d189fn2">Reference is
                                unclear.</note></p>
                        <p>On my recent trip to the other side, this subject was foremost in almost
                            every conference that I held.<note n="3" xml:id="d189fn3"><persName
                                    corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> visited Paris, Bonn, and
                                London between September 8 and 14. Documentation on his trips is in
                                Department of State, Central Files, 033.1100–RA.</note></p>
                        <p>I agree most heartily with the opinion you expressed today that the
                            United States should support this project to the limit.</p>
                        <p>I have a task force studying it, and it will make a report shortly to the
                            Council on Foreign Economic Policy.</p>
                        <p>It is my personal opinion that this subject will move swiftly now in
                            Britain, and that their decision may be taken shortly after the turn of
                            the year.</p>
                        <p>When that time comes, I feel that we should promptly make a public
                            statement in support of the project. As you know, we hold an indirect
                            veto over it because the consent of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                >GATT</gloss> will be required. That will give us an opportunity to
                            do some trading also, but I would be strongly opposed to our
                            over-trading.</p>
                        <p>There will be strong opposition in this country when this idea develops.
                            The protectionist group do not seem yet to have been alerted to it, but
                            that cannot long be delayed, and it will be argued powerfully that
                            German manufacturers will now drive our products out of the European
                            market.</p>
                        <p>There will also be delicate questions to work out with respect to the
                            most-favored-nation principle.</p>
                        <p>It is my own conviction that this may be the most significant economic
                            event in my generation, and I wish it well.</p>

                            yesterday for export controls on ferrous scrap for the remainder of 1956
                            as a preliminary step to export controls on scrap in 1957.<note n="2"

                            have been rejected three times in the past year or so by the <gloss
                                target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>For the remainder of 1956 Commerce proposes immediately to grant export
                            licenses generally up to the stated or estimated requirements. It
                            contends this action is necessary to prevent excessive exports in
                            anticipation of controls. No information has been submitted by Commerce
                            on the nature and extent of the proposed 1957 export controls. The main
                            reason given by Commerce for this proposal is that increasing exports,
                            together with a record level of domestic consumption, would seriously
                            jeopardize U.S. industry in a national emergency.</p>
                        <p>Congress requested Commerce to make a study of U.S. scrap resources with
                            a view to determining their adequacy for U.S. industry. This study will
                            not be completed until early 1957. Until the results of that study are
                            known, there is no basis for emergency action to restrict exports. The
                                <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss> area considers the Commerce proposal
                            to be without merit for several reasons.</p>
                        <p>Insofar as Western Europe is concerned, these countries have taken
                            measures to reduce their dependency on U.S. scrap and there is reason to
                            believe that their imports from the U.S. next year will decline. This is
                            in direct contradiction to the statement in the Commerce submission to
                            the effect that the trend in friendly foreign countries is to increase
                            their dependency on the U.S. for scrap. Supporting material on this has
                            been made available to Mr. <persName>Bray</persName> in Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName>’s office.</p>
                        <p>There is one new aspect to the Commerce proposal. As submitted this time,
                            the proposal does not exclude Canada and Mexico from the proposed export
                            controls. In the past, these two countries have been treated as if they
                            were part of the U.S. insofar as scrap is <pb n="471" xml:id="pg_471"
                                facs="0499"/>concerned. If this policy were to be changed, this
                            might have serious repercussions on our relations with Canada. Attached
                            is a copy of our last memorandum on scrap export controls as these would
                            affect Western Europe.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that you call Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PHV1"
                                >Prochnow</persName>, who will represent the Department at today’s

                            <p>Imports of scrap from the U.S. have been essential in permitting
                                steel production in the United Kingdom and the European Coal and
                                Steel Community to reach their present high level. They have also
                                been an important factor in limiting price inflation in Europe and
                                in building up essential stocks which were very low prior to the
                                summer of 1954. High level steel production in these countries in
                                the coming year will continue to depend heavily on the ability of
                                these countries to import a large quantity of their total scrap
                                needs from the U.S. The proposed Commerce Department limitation on
                                scrap exports might seriously affect the economic viability of the
                                Western European economy, in turn, adversely influencing the defense
                                capabilities of these <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                                countries. It could threaten, or reverse, economic trends in Western
                                Europe towards greater productivity and strength. It has been
                                estimated, for example, that Britain’s steel production for 1955
                                would have been reduced by about the volume of scrap imports from
                                the U.S., (about 900,000 tons), if U.S. supplies had not been freely
                                available.</p>
                            <p>In the case of the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> countries,
                                U.S. export controls on scrap would strengthen the hand of
                                nationalistic groups in the Community and of those elements pressing
                                for internal controls and restrictive arrangements on scrap. The
                                High Authority is on record as hoping that the U.S. will not apply
                                export controls. If, however, the U.S. for significant cause
                                considers it is compelled to adopt export controls, the High
                                Authority has asked that it be given at least three months advance
                                notice to make plans for alleviating the adverse impact on the
                                Community and Western Europe as a whole. Scrap export controls <pb
                                    n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0500"/>by the U.S. might
                                constitute a setback for European integration and the development of
                                a free competitive market.</p>
                            <p>In response to representations by the U.S., the United Kingdom and
                                the European Coal and Steel Community have undertaken current and
                                long range programs to reduce their dependence on U.S. scrap. Scrap
                                imported from the U.S. is expensive for the Europeans and has
                                significantly increased the cost burden for the European steel
                                industry. It is expected that high prices on U.S. scrap will set
                                    [<hi rend="italic">act</hi>?] as a strong deterrent on European
                                imports from the U.S., somewhat reducing European imports for 1956,
                                particularly in the second half of that year. The European steel
                                industry is also expected to make less scrap as a result of current
                                programs to reduce the proportion of scrap to pig iron in steel
                                making. In the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>, which took
                                action substituting pig iron for scrap in 1955, it is estimated that
                                500,000 tons of scrap were saved last year as a result of this
                                program. Western European countries are also attempting to increase
                                domestic scrap availabilities. These measures to reduce dependence
                                on imported scrap are, for the most part, long-term in nature. If,
                                however, it is possible in the interim to continue the open end
                                scrap policy in the U.S., the European countries now heavily
                                dependent on U.S. imports will be enabled to keep up their

                            interest in a satisfactory solution of the problem of ownership of

                            Department’s point of view and added that he hoped that a satisfactory
                            solution would be arrived at. This was concurred in by <persName
                                corresp="#p_HW1">Hallstein</persName>, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> asked me to discuss the
                            question with Minister <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>.
                            After dinner that evening, I had a long conversation with <persName
                                corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> who vehemently argued for his
                            point of view, that private ownership under German law would be legally
                            different than would be the case in other <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> countries. Under the German system, he said,
                            ownership would really amount to custodianship; private enterprise would
                            actually only control the material subject to strict supervision by the
                            state, and also subject to severe penalties for violation of the rules
                            which would be laid down governing the handling of the material. I
                            explained to him very carefully the US position which he fully
                            understands. He said that he would be eager either to come to the US to
                            explain his point of view or to send two of his specialists for that
                            purpose. It also was quite clear that <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1"
                                >Strauss</persName> is actuated by fear of French Socialist
                            influence leading to public ownership in this and other fields.</p>
                        <p>I discussed matter briefly before departure with <persName
                                corresp="#p_HW1">Hallstein</persName> who expressed impatience with
                                <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>’ point of view,
                            insisting that a decision on the matter should be made within a few
                            days. I believe <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> will
                            attempt to offer some compromise formula.</p>

                        <p>The recent shift in British attitudes towards economic integration with
                            the Continent has been so great that there now exist a real possibility
                            that it may take place if the Commonwealth and the United States

                        <p>Establishment of a Free Trade Area, in distinction to a Customs Union
                            (and one which does not apply to agricultural products), will enable the
                            British to maintain their Imperial Preference System, while, at the same
                            time, they would enjoy equal access with Germany, their strongest
                            continental competitor, to the markets of other states within the Free
                            Trade Area. It would also permit Britain again to assume a leading role
                            in the movement for European unity.</p>
                        <p>There are signs of opposition to the British plan in the U.S. Treasury
                            and it may develop in other Departments of the U.S. Government which
                            fear that it may postpone the day of convertibility and perhaps impede
                            progress toward dollar liberalization. The added strength to the British
                            and European economies which would come of a Free Trade Area would
                            probably have the opposite result, hastening the time when they will be
                            strong enough to reach these desirable objectives.</p>
                        <p>The British have always considered us to be strong proponents of European
                            unity. Now that they may be buying a piece of this bill of goods
                            themselves, they are doubtless counting on our strong support. Any other
                            policy on our part would be widely construed as capitulation by the U.S.
                            Administration to narrow economic pressure groups and would have a
                            severely adverse effect on British estimates of the integrity of U.S.

                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> called at my
                            office this morning just prior to his departure for New York. He will be
                            absent from Washington until the end of this week.</p>
                        <p>I read to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> the
                            draft of your proposed letter to him stating the Department’s position

                            being transmitted because it had been prepared prior to the recess of
                            the <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> negotiators.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> felt strongly that
                            he should proceed immediately with the bilaterals with Italy and France,
                            and that they should be concluded before the 1st of November. He gave me
                            all of the reasons, with which you are familiar, particularly stressing
                            the fact that <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> is now further
                            away from consummation than ever before, and that the Administration
                            would be under severe criticism if concrete progress toward applying
                            atomic power in the foreign field were not made in the next few
                            months.</p>
                        <p>I advised Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> that it
                            was your and the Department’s feeling that conclusion of a <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> agreement was by no means
                            impossible, and that we were optimistic that real progress would be made
                            within the next few months. We felt that the conclusion of the
                            bilaterals would seriously, and perhaps decisively, prejudice the
                            ultimate adoption of the <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>
                            concept. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> appeared
                            to doubt that <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> could be put
                            through in any event.</p>
                        <p>After some discussion, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1"
                                >Strauss</persName> stated that he felt he should bring this to the
                            attention of the President and you in person, and suggested that he
                            would like to make a presentation upon his return to Washington at the
                            beginning of next week. I promised to convey this information to
                            you.</p>
                        <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477" facs="0505"/>
                        <p>It is my impression that Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1"
                                >Strauss</persName> might be willing to delay the negotiations on
                            the bilaterals until some agreed-upon deadline, such as perhaps January
                            1, 1957, and that if at that time more progress had not been made, he
                            would be free to proceed along the lines he has proposed. I did not have
                            an opportunity to pursue this possibility with him further, as he had to
                            leave to catch his plane.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_CJB1">Conant</persName> is uniquely qualified
                            to make the Chancellor understand the whys and wherefores of ownership,
                            supply, control problems, et cetera, and there is no doubt that he has
                            been exposed to much misinformation and illusory misconceptions so

                            I would suggest that we would leave it to him to notify any of the other

                                    Document 188</ref>.</note> based on Department telegram 900, I
                            emphasized importance United States attaches to government ownership
                            fissionable material as provided in our own Atomic Energy Act.
                            Chancellor appeared to be already convinced by my letter and agreed it
                            was rather absurd that some Germans were taking attitude against
                            government ownership when United States with its deep commitment private
                            enterprise system has as late as 1954 reaffirmed principle government
                            ownership fissionable material. He assured me we need have no worry on
                            this point, that he was quite prepared to yield on this issue and as he
                            remarked in passing <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> was
                            now occupied with other matters.</p>
                        <p>Although Chancellor seemed to require no further arguments, I reminded
                            him of fact that in March and in May I had conveyed to <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH1">V. Brentano</persName> United States views in
                            regard to our readiness to deal more favorably with 6-nation atomic
                            energy authority than on bilateral basis with any constituent nations.
                            Emphasizing this point, I expressed my personal opinion that Germany
                            would get ahead more rapidly with its own atomic power development
                            through <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> than by any other
                            means. As in the case of my argumentation about ownership, I was clearly
                            forcing an open door.</p>
                        <p>While the Chancellor said he was ready to yield on the question of <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>, he made it plain that he felt
                            the French demands in regard to Common Market were such that they could
                            not be met by the Germans on points involving relation between employer
                            and employee. These were matters, he said, which were beyond the
                            competence of the Federal Government. He looked forward, however, to his
                            conversation with <persName corresp="#p_MG2">Mollet</persName> in
                            November and seemed to believe the difficulties could be overcome. But
                            as the French-German disagreement on Common Market was beyond my
                            competence I pursued [<hi rend="italic">did not pursue</hi>] this topic
                            further.</p>
                        <p>In discussing briefly developing situation in Hungary and Poland,
                            Chancellor made obvious comment that Russia had lost prestige all over
                            the world whatever might be eventual outcome in Hungary <pb n="481"
                                xml:id="pg_481" facs="0509"/>and in the whole world, situation was
                            in a state of flux. He expected no demonstration or uprising in Soviet

                                2, the Department stated that it was “encouraged by general tone

                            requested the Department to consider the question as to whether future
                                <gloss target="#t_EXIMBank1">Eximbank</gloss> credits are to be
                            granted to steel enterprises in the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>
                            which are members of the steel export cartel.</p>
                        <p>The State Department believes the most feasible course of action is to
                            operate with the presumption that the credit should be refused if the
                            applying firm is a member of the export cartel. However, exceptional
                            cases may arise in which there are overriding political or <pb n="482"
                                xml:id="pg_482" facs="0510"/>economic reasons for granting the
                            credit which necessitate a departure from this basic anti-cartel policy.
                            In order to carry out this policy it is recommended the <gloss
                                target="#t_EXIMBank1">Eximbank</gloss> inform interested Government
                            agencies at the earliest possible time when an applicant or prospective
                            applicant for a credit is a member of the steel export cartel. Such a
                            system of case-by-case review would enable any interested Government
                            agency to give the <gloss target="#t_EXIMBank1">Eximbank</gloss> prompt
                            guidance as to any special factors involved while at the same time
                            permitting maximum action in support of this Government’s anti-cartel
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>If the credit is denied on the basis of the cartel factor, it is further
                            recommended that the applicant firm be advised of the reason and
                            informed the matter would, of course, be reconsidered should it choose
                            to disassociate itself from the cartel.</p>

                        <p>1. To review progress in economic integration in Western Europe, to
                            analyze the probable impact on United States trade and other economic
                            and political interests, and to recommend a statement of United States
                            policy in the light of pending proposals.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Facts Bearing on the Problem</hi></p>
                        <p>2. Economic integration is realistically viewed as a process involving
                            gradual steps by two or more countries, jointly, based on reduction and
                            eventual elimination of barriers to movements of goods, and of capital
                            and labor as well, within a defined area. Advanced forms of integration
                            may involve transfer to “supranational” institutions, responsible to the
                            group as a whole, of certain governmental <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483"
                                facs="0511"/>powers of decision previously exercised by national
                            governments separately.</p>
                        <p>3. Since 1948, United States policy has outspokenly favored economic
                            integration in Western Europe “as a means of building strength,
                            establishing security, and preserving peace” (Mutual Security Act of
                            1955) and of cementing Germany to the West by organic bonds of common
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>4. Postwar progress in European economic cooperation and integration has
                            been made chiefly through several international organizations: <list>

                                    the gradual integration of the coal, iron, and steel industries
                                    of these six “Schuman Plan” countries. Thus far the <gloss
                                        target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> is the only organization in
                                    which governmental powers of decision have been transferred to
                                    central institutions in a “limited but decisive sphere” of the
                                    economies of the member countries.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>5. Two fresh steps of large potential importance are under active study
                            in Europe, though neither has yet reached definitive form. These steps
                            are designed to widen the base of European prosperity, (1) by the
                            formation of a “common market” among the Six—initially in the form of a
                            customs union with central institutions—to reach maturity in 12–15
                            years; and (2) by the association of the United Kingdom and probably
                            several other <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> countries with the
                            common market, in a “free trade area” in which trade barriers within the
                            area would be gradually eliminated while the additional members would
                            retain their tariff autonomy with respect to nonmember countries. The
                            British, because of domestic political and security considerations and
                            their Commonwealth commitments, contemplate exluding raw and
                            manufactured foodstuffs, feedstuffs, drink and tobacco from the new
                            arrangements.</p>
                        <p>6. The President, in a speech in a Miami, Florida, on October 29, 1956,
                            had this to say about European integration: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Nothing has been more heartening than the recent announcement of
                                    two new proposals that would advance further the economic
                                    integration of Europe.</p>
                                <p>“The first is the concept that six Western European countries

                                    the United States. The second is the challenging idea that,

                        <p>9. In the past eight years, Western European economies have made a
                            remarkable recovery and advanced far above prewar levels. These gains
                            have been accompanied by a notable growth of international economic
                            cooperation and significant though limited experience in regional
                            economic integration.</p>
                        <p>10. Experience to date has abundantly justified U.S. policy in support of
                            both cooperation and integration, though full convertibility of
                            currencies and elimination of import restrictions have yet to be
                            achieved.</p>
                        <p>11. An integrated Western Europe continues to appear desirable on
                            political and economic grounds, even if its full attainment still
                            appears distant.</p>
                        <p>12. Recognizing that Europeans must determine, evolve, and carry through
                            agreed specific moves in this direction, the U.S. has continued to give
                            sympathetic consideration to all steps proposed in the light of overall
                            U.S. policy.</p>
                        <p>13. While important pending proposals are taking definite form, it seems
                            proper to state the U.S. view of considerations that should be taken
                            into account as they may be matured and implemented.</p>
                        <p>14. It is imperative that further progress in regional integration be
                            consistent with strengthening the whole free world, in which the United
                            States and all other free countries have a vital interest.</p>
                        <p>15. The matured proposals should therefore harmonize European economic
                            integration with other major objectives of U.S. policy: the promotion of
                            multilateral trade, the attainment of general currency convertibility,
                            and the avoidance of increased tariffs or large-scale discrimination
                            against our goods and those of other countries in the free world.</p>

                                corresp="#p_MJ1">Jean Monnet</persName> at his apartment on
                            Saturday, the 17th. He talked at some length about <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss>, and for my part, I think he
                            has once again in his inimitable fashion come up with a very important
                            idea. Reduced to its simplest terms—the present difficulties in the
                            Middle East and the shortages of oil products caused thereby have
                            greatly increased popular interest in <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >Euratom</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>He feels that practical, and indeed spectacular, support of <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss> by the U.S. as soon as the
                            treaty has been signed would, in the present circumstances, have an
                            effect in Europe comparable to that of the Marshall Plan. This could do
                            a great deal to rebuild American prestige here without causing any
                            damage to us in other parts of the world. I was very taken by his basic
                            idea and agree that the U.S. now has a real and very important public
                            relations reason for supporting <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >Euratom</gloss> to the hilt, and with as much public fanfare as
                            possible as soon as the treaty has been signed, provided always that its

                        <p>2460. I had long and interesting conversation Saturday with <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName>. Theme of his thought was that
                            unusual opportunity has been created for US to reap large dividends of
                            good will from close and generous association with <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>. He believes that <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> treaty will probably be
                            successfully completed and signed by end of year.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> feels that Middle East
                            events, i.e., closing of Suez Canal and sabotage of pipelines, have
                            amply demonstrated unhealthy dependence of European economy on Middle
                            East oil and necessity for development of alternate source of energy.
                            The only substantial alternate seems to him to be atomic energy, and he
                            feels time is ripe for very far-reaching development of atomic power in
                            Europe, which, because of higher cost of fuel here, could develop much
                            more rapidly than will be the case in continental US.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> feels that public opinion
                            throughout Europe would be captured by a broad scale and generous
                            program of US support for <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>,
                            both in the supply of materials and in technical cooperation. This would
                            breathe substantial new life into President’s program “Atoms for Peace”
                            which so far has been considered primarily as fine theory and as
                            propaganda effort and so has failed to make any very solid impression on
                            European public opinion.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> recognizes that Middle East
                            crisis has caused strain on Atlantic solidarity and does not feel that
                            this can be very satisfactorily patched up, except by diverting the
                            attention of public opinion to some other field. He feels that concrete
                            US support of <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>
                            <pb n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0517"/>would capture European
                            imagination in the same way as the Marshall Plan, and could not be
                            objected to by the Arab states. He feels that such support by the US
                            should meet the US objective of finding some way to tighten our
                            relationships with Europe without at the same time doing damage to our
                            position in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> feels that to obtain maximum
                            of good will for US, it is of great importance that US accept principle
                            that control by <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> organization
                            will be adequate for US purposes, thus avoiding necessity for US
                            inspectors in Europe. He realizes that no firm decision by US can be
                            taken prior to finalization of <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> treaty, but emphasized importance of this aspect of
                            matter both as means of gaining good will for US and as important
                            element in promoting rapid ratification of treaty.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName> recognizes that what he has
                            in mind will probably require amendments to US legislation and will
                            require relatively prompt and very high level support in the US
                            Government if it is to be successful.</p>
                        <p>I think <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Monnet</persName>’s idea is of real
                            importance and I agree with his views. The US has always favored <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> as a means of strengthening
                            European unity. Now, however, I think <persName corresp="#p_MJ1"
                                >Monnet</persName> is right in feeling that <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> presents us with a remarkable
                            new opportunity of improving America’s position with European public
                            opinion. I would recommend that <persName corresp="#p_MJ1"
                                >Monnet</persName>’s concept be given high level consideration in
                            order that we can be prepared to give prompt and practical support to
                                <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> as soon as it comes into

                            Possibility this direction could be public announcement US proposed to
                            make special agreement with <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>,
                            if final terms made possible, to provide for special relationship
                            between <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> and US. Such special
                            agreement could recognize (1) primary importance of Western Europe in
                            atomic energy field because of scientific and technical knowhow, level
                            of industrial and economic development, etc., (2) continuing US interest
                            in European integration, (3) special importance attached by US to
                            cooperation with 6 countries within <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> framework,
                            (4) probability that intensive US–<gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> cooperation would undoubtedly cut down the time
                            before atomic energy can compete economically with oil imports.</p>

                            demonstrated by the current oil shortage and, second, by an imaginative

                                    >Strauss</persName>, created a temporary impasse. There is now a
                                general, although cautious, optimism in Europe that a treaty will be
                                drafted by early January and signed by the middle of the month.</p>

                                    <item>The treaty will allow the French to engage in nuclear
                                        weapons research and development which would permit
                                        explosion of a weapon in four years, as demanded by the
                                        Chamber of Deputies last July. Presumably the Brussels group
                                        will insist, however, upon the inspection and control
                                        authority of the Community being complete, which means that
                                        the Community will have access to French weapons research
                                        and development work as well as to any subsequent weapons
                                        inventory, should the French decide to take advantage of
                                        this permissive right.</item>

                            <p>The major remaining threat to the successful negotiation of the
                                treaty is the possibility of new demands by the French, inspired by
                                their military, and drawn from the failure in the Middle East, for
                                even greater freedom of action in the nuclear weapons field. French
                                insistence on this point could destroy the project, as it would lead
                                to a defection of the Socialist Party support of <gloss
                                    target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss>, especially the critically
                                important German <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>.</p>
                            <p>The institutional, and especially the supranational character of
                                    <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss>, has not developed
                                along the lines originally proposed by supporters of the Community.
                                The supporters now see <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss>
                                evolving into a supranational organization. Rather than writing into
                                the treaty broad institutional provisions, the current tactic is to
                                simplify the treaty, which will place responsibilities on <gloss
                                    target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss> itself to work out
                                unresolved issues which would otherwise have been spelled out in
                                explicit treaty provisions. Finally, there is the expectation that
                                the sheer size of the task of atomic energy development which must
                                be assumed by the Community will force it to assume supranational
                                characteristics.</p>
                            <p>While the <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss> negotiators are
                                unanimous in their intent to develop a comprehensive and effective
                                control system covering all aspects of atomic energy development,
                                the supporters are equally unanimous in their view that some special
                                arrangement must be worked out between the U.S. and <gloss
                                    target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss> which will neither require
                                inspection by the U.S. along the lines of existing power bilateral
                                arrangements nor by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The
                                Europeans insist that a subordinate status implicit in U.S.
                                inspection <pb n="494" xml:id="pg_494" facs="0522"/>would make the
                                Community politically unacceptable to the participating countries.
                                Inspection by the Agency, when neither the U.S. nor the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UKG1">U.K.</gloss> are prepared to accept similar
                                inspection, would be equally unacceptable and be subject to the
                                further fundamental objection of permitting inspection of their
                                facilities by Soviet and satellite personnel.</p>
                            <p>In recent weeks there has been a sharpening of European interest and
                                hope in <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss> which has led to
                                a sense of urgency on the part of its supporters in Europe. This new

                            letter outlines my views along the lines of our discussion.</p>
                        <p>The need for the development of nuclear power by the Western European
                            countries is being increasingly emphasized as a result of the decreasing
                            availability of conventional sources of power. There is little doubt
                            that all countries of the area are now reexamining their atomic power
                            goals in the light of the Suez crisis and are preparing for the payment
                            of high costs of atomic power in order to improve the security of their
                            sources of energy. The advanced technological capabilities of the
                            countries of Western Europe provide an adequate basis on which to build
                            nuclear power programs.</p>
                        <p>If U.S. assistance and U.S. industrial participation are to be
                            significant parts of these Western European nuclear programs, there <pb
                                n="496" xml:id="pg_496" facs="0524"/>must be power bilateral
                            agreements between the United States and the countries involved. It is
                            in this connection that apparent inconsistencies in existing policy are
                            impeding the progress of our Atoms for Peace Program.</p>
                        <p>To encourage the establishment of <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss>, the Department of State has held back the

                            certain countries which are members of the Community of Six.</p>
                        <p>We have been advised that the Department apprehends that negotiating
                            power bilaterals with Italy and Germany would affect the attitude of

                            attributable to their Suez experience. If nothing happens to <persName

                                >Lewis</persName></hi>: We have now received preliminary reports
                            from our Missions in Europe regarding the proposal that this Government
                            made to the European Governments concerned for handling prospective
                            bilateral negotiation with us in such a fashion as to minimize any
                            possible adverse effects on the <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >Euratom</gloss> Treaty negotiations now going on in Brussels. While
                            we have not heard officially from the Germans, Italians, or the French,
                            it now appears that their three Ambassadors in Washington will shortly
                            make a démarche to us, based on consultation among the Six Nations,
                            suggesting a formula which will permit the three principal countries to
                            move ahead now with specific nuclear power projects under appropriate
                            bilateral arrangements with the United States in such a manner as not to
                            prejudice their negotiations in Brussels.</p>
                        <p>In order that we may be prepared to move with dispatch once the three
                            nations have formally approached us, I am asking Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGC1">Gerard Smith</persName> to get in touch with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HJA1">John Hall</persName> of the Commission,
                            to be sure that any necessary preparatory staff work may be done in
                            advance. As one of the conditions of the apparent understanding among
                            the Brussels powers will be that their benefits and obligations under
                            bilateral agreements with the United States should be transferred to
                                <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss>, I hope the Commission
                            will find it possible to agree to arrangements in this sense.<note n="2"

                        <p>I have just spent a tense hour with Van den Berg, who, with his associate
                            from the Coal and Steel Community, called on me on the scrap matter,
                            just after they had talked with McCoy<note n="2" xml:id="d215fn2">Horace
                                B. McCoy, Administrator of the Business and Defense Services
                                Administration, Department of Commerce.</note> at Commerce.</p>
                        <p>I had met Van den Berg when I visited the Dutch steel plants, and I
                            happen to know most of the persons whom he represents in the various
                            European steel plants.</p>
                        <p>I gave them a very rough ride, thinking it would perhaps be more helpful
                            if I did this than if either of you had to.</p>
                        <p>I told them that they must stop saying that there was an understanding
                            that they would receive 200,000 tons a month this year, and then made
                            the same three points I have been making to others, as follows.</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>That unless they voluntarily stay within the tonnage they took
                                last year, they run great risk of the imposition of quotas either by
                                the Congress or by the Administration.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>That they should take more in bundles and less in heavy
                                melting.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>That they should prove to our government that they have a
                                permanent solution for their metallics problem.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>As to the building of blast furnances, I gather that at long last they
                            may have a suitable program under way. They think that by the end of
                            1958 they will be self-sufficient in metal. I suggest that Ben
                            Thibodeaux ask our observer at <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> to
                            report on the status of the blast furnance program in Europe.</p>
                        <p>They made a strong plea that if they did not receive 600,000 tons more
                            than last year, it would curtail production in Europe. To this I
                            replied: “So what?” I said that their present predicament was the result
                            of faulty planning and lack of foresight, and that there was a basic
                            unfairness in asking the United States to make up for their own
                            neglect.</p>
                        <p>They then said that they were surprised at how we had permitted the
                            Japanese to increase. I replied that this was very understandable in
                            view of the importance of Japan to the military and economic picture of
                            the United States in the Pacific, and that a strong argument could be
                            made that scrap should be taken away from the Community <pb n="512"
                                xml:id="pg_512" facs="0540"/>and given to Japan. I said that the
                            nations of the Community were not helping us carry any part of the load
                            of the free nations of the Pacific, and that, maybe after we gave scrap
                            to Japan, they would.</p>
                        <p>I am afraid I have forever made myself unpopular with the steel industry
                            in Europe, but I thought perhaps these plain truths could be said by me
                            more effectively than by anyone else because of my background both in
                            the American and European industries.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary opened the meeting by expressing his satisfaction at the
                            visit of the “Wise Men” and at the evidence of progress in the project
                            to establish common Western European use of atomic power. He recalled
                            the interest which the President and he, and the Congress as well, had
                            consistently taken in all developments to create greater unity in
                            Europe. Only in this way, in their opinion, could Europe develop its
                            full potentialities. The world and Europe could not afford the
                            continuance of the divisions which the experience of the last thirty
                            years had demonstrated were intolerable. For this reason the United
                            States had strongly supported the European Coal <pb n="513"
                                xml:id="pg_513" facs="0541"/>and Steel Community and rejoiced that
                            as this new source of power—the atom—developed, it was being approached
                            on an European rather than on a purely national basis.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked in conclusion that although the bulk of the talks
                            which the “Wise Men” would have in Washington would be of a technical
                            nature, he was fully aware of the political significance of their visit
                            and their work, and that he would be happy to hear what they had to say
                            concerning their plans and concerning what we could do to help.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Armand</persName> replied for the “Wise Men”, noting that
                            as they had no chairman he owed this honor to the chance of the
                            alphabet. Noting that he and his colleagues did not represent individual
                            countries but had been designated to speak for the Six countries
                            collectively, he thanked the Secretary for the invitation to visit the
                            United States, which had been of great support to them in their
                            efforts.</p>
                        <p>The problem with which the “Wise Men” were intended to deal, Mr.
                                <persName>Armand</persName> continued, was as follows: Europe
                            achieved its industrial strength and greatness at a moment when coal was
                            the principal source of energy; Europe was thus, as it were, “born rich”
                            in energy, and acquired the habits of a rich area. Later, however, both
                            as a result of “adventures” and of the rise of oil as a source of
                            energy, Europe became less and less rich and finally, following the last
                            World War, became an importer of energy. Now something like one quarter
                            of the Six countries’ energy supply comes from outside of the area,
                            mostly from the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>The consequences of this increasing poverty in energy resources has been
                            increasingly realized over the past few years by economists and experts,
                            but not by the general public. The Suez crisis and its aftermath,
                            however, has brought home the problem and “sensitized” public opinion to
                            it. The problem, in the view of the political leaders, is twofold:
                            First, the standard of living of any industrial country tends to be
                            proportional to its energy consumption. Therefore, if new energy sources
                            are not available in Europe, the results can only be a ceiling on the
                            standard of living, which could have most serious consequences in the
                            internal political situation of all the major western European
                            countries. Second, if Europe should become almost totally dependent (to
                            something like 40 percent of its energy requirements by 1957) on the
                            Middle East, and hence at the mercy of rulers of individual Middle
                            Eastern countries, there was a serious external political danger which
                            needed no elaboration.</p>
                        <p>The problem, then, was how Europe could get out of this impasse. The
                            possible increase of coal production was very limited, and while Europe
                            would continue to import coal from the United States, there was a limit
                            to how much further dependence could be placed on such imports. As
                            concerns oil, even with the possible results <pb n="514" xml:id="pg_514"
                                facs="0542"/>which may be expected from new prospecting in Europe
                            and also in the Sahara (where there were political problems too), the
                            possibilities were definitely limited. As a result, Europe’s import
                            requirements for energy were estimated (in millions of tons of coal
                            equivalent) at a hundred million tons for 1960 and three hundred million
                            (or 40 percent of Europe’s total energy requirements) for 1975. The
                            balance of payment consequences of energy imports on this scale were
                            almost inconceivable.</p>
                        <p>In this situation, atomic energy must be used to compensate for the lack
                            of other energy sources. The Europeans realize that atomic energy is an
                            unknown, but the “Wise Men” believe that they can establish a production
                            program for atomic energy which can cause imports of energy from outside
                            of Europe to begin leveling off in 1962 at a level of approximately 150
                            million tons of coal equivalent. They had succeeded, Mr.
                                <persName>Armand</persName> believed, in making this problem
                            understood during their trip around Europe. This common understanding of
                            the problem in Europe was the first prerequisite for a real program. The
                            other was the establishment of effective cooperation between the United
                            States and Europe in this field. This cooperation should be a two-way
                            street; the United states could be of great assistance to a large
                            European program in terms of fuel and information, but in counterpart
                            Europe had decided to equip itself as a real partner by mobilizing its
                            intellectual forces.</p>
                        <p>In summary, Mr. <persName>Armand</persName> said, nuclear energy is
                            necessary for progress; but Europe is behind in its development. If,
                            with the help of the United States, Europe can catch up this lag, Europe
                            will fructify and within ten years will be able to be a real partner.
                            The program is ambitious, but if such a program is not carried out,
                            Europe will rapidly become an underdeveloped territory.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GF2">Giordani</persName> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EF1">Etzel</persName> agreed entirely with Mr.
                                <persName>Armand</persName>’s presentation.</p>
                        <p>In reply, the Secretary said their presentation fell on sympathetic ears.
                            He was particularly struck by the reference to the ambitious nature of
                            the program, which demonstrated the way in which nations can now satisfy
                            their ambitions. Formerly, such ambitions were satisfied by dominating
                            others, but that epoch is ended. A new vista is now opening, in which
                            ambitions can be satisfied through constructive channels such as the one
                            of which the “Wise Men” spoke. The Secretary recalled that the Japanese
                            had tried too long to satisfy their ambitions by dominating others, and
                            that at the end of the war people wondered how a nation of 80 million
                            could live confined to a few islands; however, Japan has prospered
                            during the last years through her own development. The vision which the
                            “Wise Men” have brought was of profound political significance as
                            demonstrating <pb n="515" xml:id="pg_515" facs="0543"/>how nations could
                            be great without measuring greatness in terms of control over
                            others.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary continued that he was also struck by the proposition that
                            while initially they might get help from the United States (and he hoped
                            they would), the Europeans in the context of a program such as the “Wise
                            Men” had described, could eventually return this help with interest.
                            Europe’s scientific minds were unequaled, and her high power costs gave
                            her the economic incentive; thus was created a basis for cooperation
                            quite apart from the great interest which the United States took in
                            seeing Europe, so long the cradle of Western civilization, survive and
                            grow stronger.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Armand</persName> said that to associate peoples you need
                            both fear and hope, and both of these elements are present in Europe
                            today. There is fear of the consequences of an energy shortage and of
                            the events in the Middle East, and hope of success if Europe and the
                            United States can cooperate in this field. Faced with this common danger
                            and with the common hope, Europe can succeed. The Secretary replied that
                            he hoped they would.</p>

                            from the <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> Wise Men and heard

                            presentation to the Atomic Energy Commission yesterday afternoon, though
                            I believe you were not able to be present.</p>
                        <p>I am struck by the imaginative character of the project that the Wise Men
                            have developed and the great political importance of this project, both
                            to Europe and the United States. Europe is clearly faced by a profound
                            power shortage which, if not dealt with energetically, could have
                            serious political consequences and, indeed, tend to undermine the entire
                            economy of Western Europe. I am sympathetic with the judgment of the
                            Wise Men that a constructive relationship between the Middle East oil
                            producing states and Europe can best be developed if Europe is not
                            totally dependent on imports of oil from that area. It is therefore most
                            heartening that this distinguished <pb n="516" xml:id="pg_516"
                                facs="0544"/>group is proposing to meet this problem by a bold
                            program of building nuclear power stations.</p>
                        <p>Out of this situation arises a unique opportunity for us. It means an
                            opportunity to assist the Europeans in carrying out a concerted effort
                            to solve a major European economic problem in a framework which will
                            promote political solidarity in Europe. It may well open up a new area
                            for European-U.S. collaboration which can re-establish and strengthen
                            the lines of cooperation between Western Europe and the United States
                            which were strained by the Suez situation. Finally, this opportunity to
                            associate ourselves with a major effort of Europe’s to turn atomic
                            energy to constructive purposes is at the essence of what the
                            President’s speech on December 8, 1953 contemplated.<note n="3"

                            indispensable technical advice that they need. While they are not here
                            to negotiate with us, I would hope we could also give them the sort of
                            general assurances with respect to U.S. co-operation and the supply of
                            the necessary fuel which will make it possible for them to push forward

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Etzel</persName> opened with a statement
                            setting forth the importance of <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >Euratom</gloss> to Europe, to the United States and to the free
                            world. He brought out the need for United States support of the
                            undertaking and his hope that such support would be forthcoming,
                            indicating that advantages would accrue in return to the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The President said he was struck by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EF1"
                                >Etzel</persName>’s statement that this is a two-way street. He felt
                            that it was more than that. Benefits will be felt in every direction. He
                            thought <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss> was a great hope for
                            the whole free world. He recalled that he has strongly supported a
                            united Europe as a third great force in the world. He had urged
                                <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Jean Monnet</persName> on, as he now
                            urges this group on in the same direction. He said that they may be sure
                            of our cooperation, commenting that he hopes he will live long enough to
                            see a United States of Europe come into existence. He has thought the
                            European nations must learn the biblical precept that to save their
                            lives they must lose them. He felt if they did not join together
                            deterioration and ultimate disaster were inevitable. He had no hesitancy
                            in declaring that this project would be to the benefit of the United
                            States, of the Atlantic community, and of all the world. He then asked
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> how long the
                            group would be in Washington and what their further program would be.
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said they would
                            leave Washington on Friday to visit our atomic installations. The
                            President said he had been much interested in a chart showing that
                            before many years have elapsed, the additions to energy output in Europe
                            would come from atomic sources. He asked what the costs of energy
                            production in Europe are expected to be. Mr. <persName>Armand</persName>
                            said that in the United States it costs from 4–7 mills to produce a
                            kilowatt of electricity. In Europe the cost is 10–12 mills. He said that
                            atomic power is economically competitive at that cost.</p>
                        <p>The President asked Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1"
                                >Strauss</persName> if we had in sight all of the raw material
                            needed to support the program the group was proposing. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said that this is a
                            considerable problem, because the needs they have stated are very large.
                            Even on their present trip, however, we can provide assurance at this
                            time for a very great deal of what they need. He said that raw materials
                            are rising in volume very rapidly, and in response to a question by the
                            President said that we are guaranteeing the price for producers until
                            1963 at the present <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0546"/>time. The
                            President commented that we may want to go beyond that time, in order to
                            bring in all possible explorers.</p>
                        <p>The President concluded the meeting by telling the group they may count
                            on his support.</p>

                        <p>3873. In course conversation with member in Maurice Faure Cabinet Feb 5,
                            Embassy officer was told French Delegation was very pleased at outcome
                            latest Brussels Foreign Ministers meeting. French were optimistic that
                            forthcoming Foreign Ministers meeting (Feb 17) and Chiefs of Govt
                            meeting (Feb 19) would permit political decisions on outstanding
                            problems, particularly association overseas territories with Common
                            Market. Officer stated most agricultural problems had been overcome at
                            Brussels although Dutch still had to consult Govt on several points.</p>
                        <p>Stating US attitude had ever since war been most favorable to European
                            integration on well-known political and European security grounds, he
                            expressed hope that technical considerations of trade policy or desire
                            to dispose of argricultural surpluses would not lead to active US
                            prodding to change treaty provisions now which could interminably delay
                            negotiations. Time, he felt, from political viewpoint was of essence
                            since <persName corresp="#p_MG2">Mollet</persName> Govt could get
                            treaties through but its life might be shortened after Algerian debate.
                            He expressed hope that in overall US foreign policy interest and Western
                            Europe and Atlantic security US would take no action which might hamper
                            rapid completion of Common Market treaty. In this connection, he made
                            specific reference to US views expressed to <persName corresp="#p_MRE1"

                            understood US concerns from viewpoint commercial policy and fear that
                            European markets might be closed to US agricultural products, especially
                            wheat. He also understood Canadian and <pb n="519" xml:id="pg_519"
                                facs="0547"/>Australian concerns on this subject. He said every

                            balance and outweigh technical, economic and commercial policy
                            considerations in determining US Govt attitude toward Common Market
                            treaty as a whole.</p>

                                and stated his encouragement at the progress which had been made at
                                the Brussels talks and his hope that they would concluded soon. Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> said that he hoped
                                and believed so; the only major question still outstanding concerned
                                the inclusion of overseas territories in the European Common Market.
                                He had every hope that this would be successfully dealt with at the
                                proposed meeting of the Prime Ministers of the Six countries in
                                Paris on February 19. The Secretary also reiterated his pleasure at
                                Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>’s forthcoming
                                assumption of his duties as Secretary-General of <gloss

                            <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> said that the
                                purpose of his visit was to raise two questions with the United
                                States Government in relation with the <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                    >EURATOM</gloss> negotiations which were now nearing completion.
                                The first concerned the attitude of the United States towards the
                                    <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> Treaty in its
                                present form, with particular reference to whether the Treaty
                                provided an adequate basis for future cooperation between the United
                                States and <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>. The second
                                concerned the Belgian interpretation of certain articles of their
                                present bilateral agreement with the United States in the light of
                                the <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> Treaty, with
                                particular reference to the ability of Belgium to make available
                                Congo uranium to her <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>
                                partners.</item>

                            <item>With respect to the Treaty, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1"
                                    >Spaak</persName> made clear that he was not speaking for the
                                Six, but that the Belgian Government and he personally wished to
                                assure themselves that there was nothing in the present text of the
                                Treaty which would pose on obstacle to fruitful relations between
                                the United States and <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>;
                                if there were, he felt it important that he and the other
                                negotiators should be warned in time so that they could make any
                                necessary adjustments in the Treaty, as he felt that the future
                                relationship with the United States was one of the indispensable
                                elements of <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>’s success.
                                Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> continued that
                                while the Treaty was not entirely what he had at first intended,
                                because the negotiators had to take account of the French political
                                problem on the question of military uses, it was in his opinion a
                                good Treaty, and he felt it provided a sound basis for cooperation.
                                The Secretary replied that he had not himself been able to study the
                                Treaty, and that he understood that our picture of it was incomplete
                                because of the rapidly-moving changes which had been made during the
                                past few weeks. The Secretary (and later Admiral <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> as well) assured Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> that we would do
                                our best to give him a reply on this point as soon as we could. Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> said he would
                                appreciate this, and hoped that it would be possible shortly, as the
                                final decisions on <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> were
                                scheduled to be taken at a ministerial meeting in Paris on February
                                17 or 18.</item>

                            <item>At several points in the conversation Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> reiterated his view that the
                                decision to permit military uses of atomic energy (or rather not to
                                forbid them) was unfortunate but politically indispensable. He
                                pointed out that the maintenance of at least a theoretical
                                possibility to engage in the weapons program was the price which had
                                to be paid to the moderate Right in France for their support of
                                    <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> and also of the
                                Common Market. He said this decision had been arrived at reluctantly
                                by M. <persName corresp="#p_MG2">Mollet</persName>, who as we knew
                                was opposed to a military program and had initially favored a
                                renunciation of military uses by the Six countries. Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> pointed out that under the
                                Treaty military uses would be subject to the same <pb n="521"
                                    xml:id="pg_521" facs="0549"/>strict control and inspection as
                                civil uses, up to the point of the actual fabrication of a bomb. His
                                hope was that provided the treaty did not formally prevent the
                                French from engaging in military production, they would not in fact
                                carry out a military program, in particular because of the very high
                                cost involved. As long as <persName corresp="#p_MG2"
                                    >Mollet</persName> was in power, he was sure that the French
                                would not get seriously into an atomic weapons business.</item>

                            <item>The Secretary asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1"
                                    >Spaak</persName> where the ownership problem stood. Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> replied that the
                                Treaty did not mention ownership. With respect to ownership of
                                material obtained from the United States the <gloss
                                    target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> Commission would be in a
                                position to retain title. The same would be true of materials
                                produced in common enterprises. The case which was not covered was
                                that of a private institution which produced plutonium in a reactor;
                                as it stood at present, such a company could hold the material,
                                dispose of it to <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> or sell
                                to friendly countries outside the Community. In explaining why he
                                had not supported the French in their desire to provide for complete
                                ownership by <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> of all
                                fissionable materials, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1"
                                    >Spaak</persName> maintained that the French themselves had
                                created the dilemma when they insisted on the right to engage in
                                military uses. This had created a practical difficulty, as it was
                                hard to conceive of <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>’s
                                holding title to material which had been fabricated into a bomb. Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> commented at the
                                Secretary’s request that in the United States our whole philosophy
                                of internal control over fissionable material was based on
                                Government ownership and that to us it was unconventional to think
                                of a different concept of holding material. While we did not take a
                                firm position that we could not cooperate with <gloss
                                    target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> unless the Treaty provided
                                for common ownership, we would certainly be happier if it did so.
                                With respect to the practical problem which Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> had mentioned in connection
                                with a possible French weapons program, Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> asked whether it would not be
                                possible to have <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> retain
                                ownership up to the point where control of fissionable material
                                passed from its hands into those of <gloss target="#t_WEU1"
                                    >WEU</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>
                                appeared to find this an interesting idea, but did not comment

                            <item>With respect to the Belgian bilateral, Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> asked whether Belgium would
                                be free after 1960 to make her entire uranium production available
                                to <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>. Secondly, he was
                                interested to know if we had any objection to Belgium’s making
                                available to <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> before 1960
                                the remainder of her material after the Union Minière had fulfilled
                                its obligation to the Combined Development Agency under the
                                agreement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> pointed
                                out with respect to the first problem that if the United States
                                wished to continue purchasing uranium after 1960 it could of course
                                have discussions directly with <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                    >EURATOM</gloss>. At the Secretary’s request Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> replied <pb n="522"
                                    xml:id="pg_522" facs="0550"/>that while this was a matter to
                                which the Atomic Energy Commission would have to speak, he believed
                                that there should be no insuperable difficulty. He pointed out that
                                the problem of availability of natural uranium was principally a
                                short-term, one after which the supply could be such more plentiful;
                                the Canadians anticipated fairly soon a production of natural
                                uranium much greater than that of the Belgian Congo. Following
                                Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>’ arrival, Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> repeated the
                                question. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>
                                indicated that <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>
                                requirements for enriched uranium under the program which the “Wise
                                Men” had in mind would in any case be so large that they would
                                require quantities of enriched material from the United States which
                                would have to be based on other sources over and above Congo. He
                                therefore did not think that we would find Mr. <persName

                            made great progress in their task as a result of their conversations
                            here. The Secretary said he was happy to have had the opportunity to
                            discuss the <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> Treaty with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>. He hoped that the Six

                            beginning of a new era in this field of development. Admiral <persName

                            personal pleasure at having had the opportunity to meet with the three
                            “Wise Men” and Mr. <persName>Kohnstamm</persName>. Mr. <persName

                        <p>In a call on the Secretary following his return from Germany, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHL1">Krekeler</persName> said that both
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName> and
                            Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had discussed
                            with him the problem of the relationship of overseas territories to the
                            common market. He said there was a wide difference of opinion between
                            the French Delegation and other delegations. The Chancellor recalled a
                            remark which the Secretary had made to him, that it would be desirable
                            that Germany assist in the economic development of Africa. The
                            Ambassador said that in 1951 a plan for this purpose had been developed
                            by German industrialists. However, nothing had come of it and the
                            situation in Africa had changed very radically. He said the Germans see
                            the importance of doing something in this field. On the other hand, they
                            do not wish Germany to be labeled as a colonial power. They feel their
                            position is somewhat like that of the United States. Were they to become
                            associated with colonialism, they fear that what they could accomplish
                            in under-developed areas would be seriously prejudiced. The Ambassador
                            said that the Chancellor would be very grateful for the personal views
                            of the Secretary on this subject.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he did not feel it was always possible to find an
                            answer to problems of this kind in terms of generalities. He said that
                            the U.S. had always tried to avoid its close association with the
                            British, French, Dutch, Belgians and Portuguese from committing us to
                            support their colonial policies. The governments of those countries had
                            never liked our attitude and our position had been a source of constant
                            friction between us and them. The Secretary pointed out that this
                            problem had arisen in connection with the ratification of the North
                            Atlantic Treaty and drew the Ambassador’s attention to the passage in
                            the report of the Foreign Relations Committee dealing with this matter,
                            in which it was stated that “Whether the United States will in fact
                            support the colonial policies of any of the other signatories will
                            depend entirely on our evaluation of those policies under the conditions
                            then existing and not on any obligations assumed under the pact.”

                        <p>The Secretary said that this did not mean that we should dissociate
                            ourselves from everything which the colonial powers do. He said that it
                            seemed to him that it was essential that a relationship of Africa with
                            Europe be worked out in terms of an evolution which would involve a
                            large degree of self-government on the part of the African territories
                            and a continuing close degree of association between Africa and Europe.
                            He said that there is a tendency to think of the world in terms of East
                            and West. If one looks at a map, it is apparent that Africa is the big
                            hinterland of Europe. The Secretary said that it is important that the
                            movement toward self-government be one of peaceful evolution rather than
                            one brought about by violent revolution. The colonial powers tend to
                            move slowly, in fact, too slowly. It is difficult for any government to
                            grant to a colony or an overseas territory like Algeria a greater degree
                            of autonomy than is absolutely necessary. However, if one waits until it
                            is demonstrated that there is a need for granting autonomy, it is
                            already too late. One has to move ahead of the necessities of the case.
                            This is difficult to do since people in the home countries, and in their
                            parliaments in particular, question the need for taking action. The
                            result is that by the time action is taken, it is often too late to
                            preserve the good in the relationship with overseas territories.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he thought that the Federal Republic, before
                            associating itself with the policies of colonial powers, should get the
                            best assurances it could that these policies could be calculated to work
                            out peaceful relations with the colonial areas. He thought that if a
                            policy of peaceful evolution were adopted, the prospect for Europe was
                            rather dark. It was, of course, possible to have a unified Europe, but
                            Europe needed the resources of Africa. The Secretary drew a parallel
                            between the European situation and that of the U.S. in earlier days. The
                            Eastern colonies had to federate but they could not have developed
                            without the resources of the West and a sound relationship with the
                            Western areas. He thought the same principles were applicable to Europe.
                            If Europe could work out proper relations with Africa, it could develop
                            into one of the greatest forces in the world. He said one should stop
                            thinking of Europe as the Old World. The concept of a relationship with
                            Africa opened up vistas which were new and exciting and should be
                            immensely challenging to people with forward looking ideas.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he was grateful for this expression of views. He
                            hoped that public opinion in the U.S. would support this viewpoint. The
                            Secretary said he was sure that it would.</p>

                                    rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volume.</note> Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_OE1">Ollenhauer</persName> responded
                            affirmatively to the hope that he continued to support it as firmly as
                            he had at that time. After a discussion of German reunification, the
                            Secretary emphasized our interest in the steps being taken for economic
                            unification of Europe, mentioning particularly <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> and the common market. He
                            pointed out the great advantage Germany has of not being a colonial
                            power and how with this and its economic strength it could contribute
                            materially to the working out of an association of Europe and Africa out
                            of which could come a whole new force in the world. By bringing the
                            countries of Europe and Africa closer together, Germany could further
                            the development of a great European hinterland. Europe should be
                            thinking in terms of “Young man, go South.” From the viewpoint of its
                            potentialities in Africa, Europe is not worn out, but on the threshold
                            of great development in a manner which should inspire the imaginations
                            of youth.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OE1">Ollenhauer</persName> replied that the
                            Social Democratic Party (<gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>) was in
                            favor of the common market. It had become apparent that it was
                            impracticable to integrate successfully only one segment of European
                            economy such as attempted with the Coal and Steel Community. The <gloss
                                target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> had in its discussions been concerned
                            only with two open questions, namely, to what extent agriculture should
                            be a part of the common market and whether overseas territories could be
                            included. He saw in the latter problem probable difficulty in the light
                            of the French position in Africa. He did not know what the outcome <pb
                                n="526" xml:id="pg_526" facs="0554"/>would be. He agreed entirely
                            with the Secretary on the potentialities of Africa.</p>
                        <p>With regard to <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_OE1">Ollenhauer</persName> said that his party fully
                            supported it but believed that it was necessary to have complete control
                            of fissionable material. He wondered whether under the treaty it would
                            be possible to have effective control. The position of the U.S. as the
                            largest supplier of fissionable material was very important. The
                            Secretary assured Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OE1">Ollenhauer</persName>
                            that although the U.S. cannot control the language of the treaty, we
                            would not supply fissionable material unless it was under full control.
                            We, ourselves, keep title to fissionable material in supplying it to our
                            industries. The Germans can count on the same position being taken in
                            our dealings with foreign countries.</p>

                            met in Paris between February 18 and 20 to discuss the last outstanding

                                >EURATOM</gloss> and the Common Market. In a communiqué issued on
                            February 20, they announced that agreement had been reached on all major
                            matters and expressed the hope that the two treaties would shortly be

                                    was of short duration harm would not be too great. Suspension
                                    for a longer period, however, might require basic re-examination
                                    of community’s <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0556"/>scrap

                        <p>In answer to question from <persName corresp="#p_CA2">Coppe</persName> I
                            said that although licensing suspended, as far as I knew actual exports
                            of scrap had not been stopped. <persName corresp="#p_CA2"
                                >Coppe</persName> then asked about US export intentions in light
                            Assistant Secretary McClelland’s statement (which Mission has not
                            received) to effect that there was no question of imposing quotas on
                            scrap exports.<note n="6" xml:id="d224fn6"><gloss target="#t_Luxco1"

                                    <persName>Harold C. McClelland</persName>, Assistant Secretary
                                of Commerce for International Affairs, gave an interview to the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Journal of Commerce</hi> on February 19 regarding
                                the scrap situation. The telegram pointed out that the Department of
                                Commerce did not issue a press release on the suspension of scrap
                                licensing. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, 400.119/2–2057)</note>
                            While I could not confirm statement I noted US had <pb n="529"
                                xml:id="pg_529" facs="0557"/>in past dealt with scrap export problem
                            on basis discussions with High Authority and interested governments and
                            quite possible it would continue seek limit exports in this way.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> concluded by requesting
                            urgently information concerning possible duration of licensing
                            suspension. <persName corresp="#p_CA2">Coppe</persName> stressed would
                            have helpful psychological effect if High Authority could confirm that
                            exports under licenses already issued would not be impeded.</p>
                        <p>In addition specific answers for High Authority, Mission would appreciate
                            receiving soonest text any public statements made by US officials on

                            <persName corresp="#p_MG2">Mollet</persName> said there were various
                            European problems which he would like to touch upon and he asked Mr.

                            European Common Market and the related free trade area.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PCP1">Pineau</persName> then went into some detail
                            in describing the efforts of the six countries to integrate their
                            economic activities. At the recent meeting of Prime Ministers in Paris
                            to finalize arrangements the question of the association of overseas
                            territories had also been dealt with and a decision had been reached as
                            to the relationship of those territories to the Community of Six. The
                            countries had agreed to establish a common investment fund for the
                            development of these territories, but it was pointed out that this would
                            not preclude private investment in this field. The period foreseen for
                            the development of the Community is fifteen years. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCP1">Pineau</persName> said that Great Britain is very
                            interested in establishing a free exchange between the Common Market and
                            the United Kingdom in the field of industrial products. The United
                            Kingdom cannot enter the Common Market arrangement itself due to the
                            fact that its special ties with the Commonwealth countries prevent it
                            from accepting agricultural products from other areas. Likewise the
                            United Kingdom does not wish to agree to the inclusion of its own
                            overseas territories in the Common Market. <persName corresp="#p_PCP1"
                                >Pineau</persName> said that the idea of a free trade area must be
                            discussed separately from the Common Market and felt that this should be
                            done in the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PCP1">Pineau</persName> said that at the end of the
                            15-year period the six countries will be as one in their economic
                            relations with other countries. Their normal exchanges with other
                            countries will not be affected and, he felt, might even be improved in
                            cases where duties established in the common tariff may be lower than
                            they are at present. The six countries will, in the operation of the
                            free trade area, be considered as one country. He felt that the
                            association of the United Kingdom in this free trade area would bring
                            England closer to the Six.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> expressed the
                            view that it would be a fine day for the free world when the Common
                            Market becomes an established fact.<note n="3" xml:id="d225fn3">In a
                                joint statement issued by <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"

                                    >Mollet</persName> on February 28, at the conclusion of the
                                talks, the President reaffirmed U.S. support for Western European
                                economic integration and indicated his full accord with the
                                objective of associating overseas territories with the proposed

                        <p>Turning to the agenda item on European integration, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH1">Brentano</persName> said that the Secretary was no
                            doubt fully informed as to the most recent developments regarding the
                            common market and <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>.<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d226fn2"><persName corresp="#p_BH1">Von
                                    Brentano</persName> was in Washington for an official 5-day
                                visit, March 3–7.</note> In brief, the drafting of the texts had
                            been completed and it was hoped the agreements could be signed by the
                            end of March. He wished to comment on only one point, the inclusion of
                            overseas territories in the common market. While the Germans favored in
                            principle the inclusion of such territories, there was some hesitation
                            over entering into colonial commitments. He believed, however, that a
                            satisfactory solution had been found and believed that the funds which
                            would be made available would be used for developing the economies of
                            these territories and help their progress toward further independence.
                            While the Federal Republic was not completely satisfied with these
                            agreements in every respect, he thought there would be no difficulty
                            over their ratification, by the Bundestag or by most <pb n="532"
                                xml:id="pg_532" facs="0560"/>of the other Parliaments. He was not so
                            sure, however, about the French Parliament.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brentano</persName> added that he welcomed the
                            fact that other European countries, such as the United Kingdom, Austria
                            and the Scandinavian countries, had expressed an interest in
                            participating in the common market through free trade zones. Even the
                            Ambassador of Morocco had expressed a desire for his country to be
                            associated with the common market. <persName corresp="#p_BH1"
                                >Brentano</persName> looked forward to the establishment of a large
                            unified economic area which should also make for a greater measure of
                            political integration of Europe. On behalf of this objective the Germans
                            had made a number of concessions but they felt the goal was worth the
                            sacrifices made.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that few subjects have such a hold on the imagination
                            of the American people as the integration and unification of Europe.
                            This had been evidenced in many ways, for example, as Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_GWF1">George</persName><note n="3" xml:id="d226fn3"
                                >Former Senator <persName corresp="#p_GWF1">Walter F.
                                    George</persName>, Special Assistant to the President.</note>
                            could testify, in many Congressional acts, and in the Secretary’s own
                            writings and speeches. President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> was also greatly interested in this subject.
                            He therefore noted with great gratification the progress which had been
                            made. We were aware that this was due in no small measure to the efforts
                            made by Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> and
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName>. It
                            would lead to great disillusionment in this country and stimulate a
                            tendency on the part of the United States to withdraw into itself should
                            this great project suffer the fate of <gloss target="#t_EDC1"
                                >EDC</gloss>. The United States would do what it could to ensure
                            that these concepts became a reality and we would welcome guidance from
                            the friends of these projects as to whether we should say anything on
                            the subject, and when and how. The Secretary remarked that sometimes the
                            best thing we could do was to say nothing.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he was interested to learn that Morocco wished to join
                            the common market and was not sure whether <persName corresp="#p_BH1"
                                >Brentano</persName> welcomed this or had merely noted it as a fact.
                            The Secretary expressed the view that if the common market is to be
                            effective and to work as we hope, it should lead to increasing political
                            unity and it might be better for the common market to be limited to
                            countries which could establish common political ties. The Secretary
                            said he also regarded the fact that the United Kingdom was not now
                            opposing the common market as a very important factor. He felt that
                                <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss> would not have failed had the
                                <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> taken earlier a more sympathetic
                            attitude toward it. The Secretary said he felt it was more important
                            than ever that we take advantage of the present fortunate concatenation
                            of events to press forward with these projects before the situation
                            changed.</p>
                        <pb n="533" xml:id="pg_533" facs="0561"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brentano</persName> said he wished to point
                            out, to avoid any misunderstanding about Morocco, that while the common
                            market is limited to the six European countries, the possibility existed
                            for other countries either to participate in the free trade zone linked
                            to the common market or to associate themselves with the common market
                            by agreement (as in the case of the association of the United Kingdom
                            with the Coal and Steel Community). He thought Morocco wished to become
                            associated with the common market in this way without becoming a
                            member.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that this discussion of Morocco reminded him of what
                            he had said to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OE1">Ollenhauer</persName>
                            about the great importance of establishing a proper relationship between
                            Western Europe and Africa.<note n="4" xml:id="d226fn4">See <ref
                                    target="#d222">Document 222</ref>.</note> He felt this offered
                            great and exciting prospects for the future. He said we tended to look
                            at maps too much on the basis of an East-West projection and that if we
                            turned the map around we would realize that Africa is the natural
                            hinterland of Europe. The possibilities for Europe in Africa are
                            immense, and on this basis Europe can entertain great prospects for the
                            future, possibly even greater than the United States and Soviet Union,
                            rather than being regarded as a declining civilization. He felt that
                            under present circumstances Horace Greeley’s old slogan “Go West, young
                            man” should be changed to “Go South, young man”. The Secretary added
                            that both <persName corresp="#p_MG2">Mollet</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCP1">Pineau</persName> were greatly interested in this
                            concept and referred to the fact that one of them had probably invented
                            the phrase EURAFRICA. It was often useful to have a phrase like this to
                            popularize a concept.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brentano</persName> referred again to the
                            suggestion made by the Moroccans and said he had found it interesting
                            because it showed they realized they were dependent on Europe and that
                            there was some distance between Morocco and the Arab world. He felt this
                            might be a good starting point for development of further relations
                            without getting involved at the same time in undesirable
                            entanglements.</p>

                            the views of the Commission in regard to certain questions which Mr.

                            informal note given to the Department of State on February 11,

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> stated two aims: (1) to
                            assure himself that there is no clause in the draft treaty creating
                                <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> which would make
                            cooperation between the United States and the European organization
                            difficult and (2) to interpret by common accord the existing bilateral
                            agreement with Belgium. He stated specifically that he would like to
                            know if the United States Government has any objection to creating the
                            system envisioned in the draft treaty so that he can be sure that the
                            relations between <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> and the
                            United States will be at least as good as those which exist under
                            bilateral agreements with Member States. In addition, a question
                            concerned with the disposition of uranium produced in Belgium and its
                            territories is raised.</p>
                        <p>In considering the questions raised by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1"
                                >Spaak</persName>, the Commission’s staff has had available to it
                            draft provisions of the proposed <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> treaty. These draft provisions were prepared by
                            separate drafting groups concerned with specific areas of interest, such
                            as materials, dissemination of information, and security controls. We
                            understand that these drafts are now in the hands of legal experts who
                            plan to eliminate repetition and provide clarification wherever
                            necessary. While we have, therefore, not had before us the final draft
                            of the treaty, we have been informed that the draft provisions may be
                            regarded as accurately representing the principles of the proposed
                            treaty. In addition to these draft provisions we have had the
                            opportunity to consult with members of the staff of the three
                            representatives of <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> who
                            recently visited Washington and, of course, the opportunity to consult
                            with the representatives of the Department of State.</p>
                        <p>We do not consider that we have either the privilege or the
                            responsibility of undertaking to transform the draft into a treaty that
                            would suit us in every respect. It is impossible for Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> to be assured that there is no
                            provision in the treaty which would make cooperation between the United
                            States and <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> difficult and
                            that United States relations with <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> will be as good as those with any other Member
                            State, as experience in the operation of <pb n="538" xml:id="pg_538"
                                facs="0566"/><gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> and
                            subsequent interpretation of the treaty will have significant bearing on
                            these questions.</p>
                        <p>We have considered it of primary importance to ascertain (1) if the
                            adoption of the treaty would, without further agreement of the parties
                            concerned, result in abrogation or modification of obligations which any
                            of the six States have assumed under bilateral arrangements with the
                            United States; and (2) whether the proposed treaty would permit <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> to assume in an agreement with
                            the United States the same kinds of obligations as have been required in
                            bilateral arrangements. In this connection we are concerned chiefly with
                            those obligations relating to control of materials, equipment, and
                            devices. Assurances on these points, of course, should come from the
                                <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> representatives, and we
                            understand that they construe the proposed treaty as not automatically
                            resulting in abrogation of third-party obligations, and as permitting
                                <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> to assume obligations
                            similar to those in our bilateral agreements. The staff review of the
                            draft provisions supports this conclusion, although it is noted that the
                            Members would be expected to negotiate the transfer of all or part of
                            the rights and obligations in the atomic field from bilateral
                            arrangements to arrangements with <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss>. In addition, it is noted that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> has stated that it is necessary
                            that Belgian uranium be made available to <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> after 1960 and points out that such a disposition
                            of Belgium uranium could appear to be in contradiction to the existing
                            bilateral with Belgium.</p>
                        <p>With the understanding, therefore, that the ratification of the proposed
                                <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> treaty will not
                            automatically relieve the Member States of their obligations to the
                            United States under bilateral agreements, we turn to the question “Would
                            the United States Government have objection to creating the system such
                            as envisioned in the draft treaty?” In connection with this question Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> points out that the
                            original conception of <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> has
                            been modified to provide for the ownership of fissionable materials by
                            private institutions under certain circumstances and to provide that
                            Member States would have equal access to materials, including
                            fissionable materials, for military as well as peaceful uses. As you
                            know, the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 does not permit the ownership of
                            fissionable materials by non-government users in the United States. In
                            our bilateral agreements we have accordingly required the government
                            receiving special nuclear materials from the Commission to retain
                            ownership of the materials. This has been done to provide an analogous
                            situation to that existing in the United States and also with the
                            thought that ownership by the Government was of value in maintaining the
                            desired controls of the material. We understand that <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> in fact would be prepared to
                            retain ownership of special nuclear material received from the United
                            States. Since any such materials <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0567"
                            />transferred from the United States to <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> could be treated in the same way as materials
                            transferred by the United States to any individual State, and if <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> can adequately control
                            materials acquired from other sources without requiring ownership by
                                <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> in every case, the
                            Commission would not consider the situation regarding ownership as being
                            a bar to effective cooperation with <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>We understand that the method of dealing with the ownership of special
                            nuclear materials has been devised to permit a Member State to use
                                <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> materials for weapons.
                            We further understand that France is the only country which has insisted
                            on this right, and understand further that West Germany is precluded by
                            other arrangements from making atomic weapons. As you know, materials
                            provided by the United States may not be used for military purposes; but
                            on the other hand, as indicated in connection with ownership of
                            materials, we understand that the proposed treaty would permit the
                            United States to be assured that no materials received from the
                            Commission, and no materials derived as a result of the use of such
                            material, would be used for military purposes. Therefore, strictly from
                            the standpoint of meeting statutory requirements, the United States
                            could cooperate with <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>, if
                                <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> in fact took the steps
                            necessary to guarantee that the materials furnished by the United States
                            would not be used for military purposes.</p>
                        <p>However, it is the policy of the United States to make certain that no
                            material, equipment or devices transferred to another country under an
                            international arrangement, or material produced as a result of the
                            foregoing, will be used for any military purpose. Accordingly, in our
                            agreements for cooperation with other nations, we have sought various
                            undertakings guaranteeing that materials so transferred or produced
                            would be used only for peaceful purposes, with specific provisions
                            relating to controls and safeguards. It should be noted that these
                            provisions in our bilateral arrangements are consistent with those
                            contained in Article XII of the approved Statute of the International
                            Atomic Energy Agency. The possibility of military projects existing
                            within <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> does raise problems
                            for United States–<gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>
                            cooperation, and may call for some steps by the Community to assure a
                            separation within <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> of
                            materials derived as a result of any future arrangements with the United
                            States. Thus there can be no flow of materials from the <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> facilities subject to the
                            provisions of an arrangement with the United States or an arrangement
                            with the International Agency, into the “military” facilities which may
                            be accommodated under <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>, and
                            any flow in the reverse direction would entail the control of such
                            materials, to insure that they were not used for any military purpose.
                            Based on our understanding of the treaty, we do not believe <pb n="540"
                                xml:id="pg_540" facs="0568"/>that it would prevent the Community
                            from accepting undertakings and provisions of present United States
                            agreements for cooperation.</p>
                        <p>If <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> sets up a system under
                            which materials obtained from the United States, and their derivatives,
                            will be used exclusively for peaceful purposes, the Commission would not
                            foresee that because of the weapon matter there would be any legal
                            impediment to cooperation with <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss>. Accordingly, if cooperation with <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> under these circumstances is,
                            as we understand it to be, important in achieving this Government’s
                            foreign policy objective in Western Europe, the Commission would be
                            willing to cooperate with <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>
                            notwithstanding the weapons feature.</p>
                        <p>The Commission, however, is concerned that <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> is being set up in a manner that would permit the
                            manufacture of nuclear weapons by Member States. We note in this
                            connection that the proposed treaty goes beyond merely permitting a
                            Member State to use uranium produced in its own country for weapons but
                            in addition permits it to acquire materials from <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> for this purpose. Since the
                            treaty itself provides that any restrictions on the use of materials
                            from third parties shall be observed, the Commission is of the opinion
                            that the United States should not only require that its material be used
                            exclusively for peaceful purposes but should use all reasonable efforts
                            to obtain agreement of other uranium supplying countries outside of
                                <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>, such as Canada and
                            South Africa, to do likewise. We understand that Canada has already
                            initiated discussions with other producer-nations with the view of
                            adopting uniform policies in regard to the control of uranium supply.
                            The Commission is prepared to cooperate with the Department in every way
                            possible in developing with Canada and other friendly ore supplying
                            nations a common approach to this problem.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, there is a related point that should be considered.
                            The bilateral agreement with Belgium (Article VII C.) provides that
                            Belgium will not transfer to any country other than the United States or
                            the United Kingdom any special nuclear materials produced in Belgium or
                            its territories unless the Government of Belgium is given assurances
                            that the material will not be used for military purposes. As we
                            understand the proposed treaty provisions, Belgium’s obligation to
                                <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> would be inconsistent
                            with this provision. The Commission would have no objection to relieving
                            Belgium of its obligation in this matter to the United States, insofar
                            as the <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> countries are
                            concerned, to the extent the material is not subject to the applicable
                            control provisions in an arrangement with the United States, since, for
                            reasons we have already indicated, we are willing to cooperate with
                                <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> despite the weapons
                            feature.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> indicated that he asked
                            the question which we have just discussed for the purpose of assuring
                            himself that the relations <pb n="541" xml:id="pg_541" facs="0569"
                            />between <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> and the United
                            States will be at least as good as those which exist between the United
                            States and those States with which the United States has bilateral
                            agreements. The Commission does not foresee that <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> will put into effect a security
                            system which would permit the exchange of Restricted Data. This is an
                            example of an area in which the relationship with <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> might not be as extensive as
                            that with an individual State. There may be others. This area may not be
                            of great importance, however, in view of the fact that substantially all
                            the technology of reactors for peaceful purposes of atomic energy is
                            declassifiable. On the other hand, there may be opportunities for
                            cooperation with <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> where it
                            might not be practicable to cooperate with one state. Part of the answer
                            as to whether relations with <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>
                            will be as good as those with individual nations will, we believe,
                            depend on whether the treaty would interfere with or make difficult the
                            development of mutually beneficial relationships between industries in
                            the United States and those within the Community. It is our
                            understanding that the draft of the proposed treaty is not intended to
                            inhibit normal commercial relationships.</p>
                        <p>We turn now to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>’s
                            questions relating to the matter of disposition of Belgian uranium. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> appears to be under the
                            impression that an interpretation of the bilateral agreement with
                            Belgium is all that is required to permit Belgium to transfer uranium
                            ore produced in Belgium and its territories to <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>. Since Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> states that this kind of
                            disposition of material is an essential basis of the European Community,
                            the Commission believes that it is important to forestall any possible
                            misunderstanding concerning this matter. As you know, there are
                            provisions in both the bilateral agreement between the United States and
                            Belgium and an agreement between the United Kingdom and Belgium
                            providing that the Combined Development Agency shall have an option to
                            purchase a percentage, to be agreed, of the Belgian ores after 1960 and
                            during the period of the agreement. These agreements must be amended in
                            order to provide for the relinquishment of the option accorded to the
                            Combined Development Agency; and, in the case of the United States, the
                            amendment must be made in accordance with Section 123 of the Atomic
                            Energy Act, including submission to the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy
                            for thirty days. The Commission is not advised of the position the
                            United Kingdom desires to take with respect to the Combined Development
                            Agency’s option.</p>
                        <p>Aside from these procedural points, the Commission has given
                            consideration as to whether its requirements of uranium and other
                            sources of supply would permit relinquishing this option on the Belgian
                            ore after 1960. Based on previous estimates, it would appear that our
                            uranium needs could be met from other sources. However, <pb n="542"
                                xml:id="pg_542" facs="0570"/>our over-all requirements for uranium
                            are again being reviewed in consideration of recent requirements,
                            indicated by <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> representatives
                            and other governments, which are in excess of previous projections on
                            which planning and agreements with the Department of Defense on
                            availability of special nuclear material for peaceful uses abroad are
                            based. The Department of Defense has currently under review its
                            projected military requirements. As soon as results of this review are
                            received, consideration will be given to over-all requirements for
                            uranium and to relinquishing our option on Belgian ore after 1960. In
                            view of what we understand to be the importance of <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> to our foreign policy
                            objectives it is believed that consideration on the United States side
                            will be favorable. As to the immediate future, in response to a previous
                            request by Mr. <persName>Robiliart</persName> of Union Minière, the
                            Commission agreed recently to a deferral to a later date of contract
                            deliveries of 550 tons U<hi rend="sub">3</hi>O<hi rend="sub">8</hi>
                            starting on July 1, 1958, in order that this material may be made
                            available to <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> with the
                            understanding that the Belgian Government will assure us this material
                            will be used only for peaceful purposes.</p>
                        <p>In his note Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> also asked
                            that there be confirmed his understanding that when the existing
                            commercial contract with Union Minière is completed the remaining
                            available material could be allocated to the European organization. In
                            this connection we must reiterate that the modifications of the existing
                            agreements as described in the preceding paragraph must be made in order
                            to permit such an allocation.</p>
                        <p>We hope the foregoing will be helpful to the Department in responding to
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>’s questions. As we have
                            indicated to you in the many discussions between our respective staffs
                            during the last several months, we desire to be of every possible
                            assistance in developing a means of cooperating with the Western
                            European nations in the peaceful use of atomic energy in such a manner
                            as to be of mutual benefit to those nations and the United States.</p>

                            resulted in basic agreement by the Six Nations in the <gloss

                        <p>The Department and the Atomic Energy Commission welcomed your invitation
                            of February 11th to review the preliminary draft of the <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> Treaty in order to consider
                            whether provisions of the draft would raise difficulties for eventual
                            cooperative arrangements between <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> and the United States. Unfortunately, it was not
                            possible for the two agencies to complete the necessary staff analysis
                            and provide you with specific comments prior to your meeting with the
                            heads of state and Foreign Ministers. I can now say on behalf of this
                            Government, however, that we see nothing in the preliminary draft of the
                            Treaty made available to us which would appear to preclude the
                            subsequent negotiation of a fruitful cooperative arrangement between the
                            United States and <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Your visit to the United States last month and that of the “Wise Men”
                            were especially helpful in identifying for this Government the
                            imperatives which have led to the development of the <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> concept and now to broad
                            agreement by the Six Nations in the draft Treaty. I believe that the
                            small technical group which the Atomic Energy Commission will send to
                            Luxembourg at the invitation of the “Wise Men” to be available for
                            consultation in developing their report will be helpful. It is the first
                            step in what we believe will be a <pb n="544" xml:id="pg_544"

                        <p>On March 25 in Rome, representatives of Belgium, France, the Federal
                            Republic of Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands signed the
                            treaties establishing a European Economic Community (Common Market) and
                            a European Atomic Energy Community (<gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss>). The treaties, which had been drafted in final
                            form by the Intergovernmental Committee in Brussels on March 9, would
                            enter into force after they had been ratified by all six countries. The

                            loan on the American market. In response to a question from the
                            Secretary, M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> said that the
                                <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> loan totalling $35 million was
                            being underwritten by Kuhn, Loeb, First Boston and Lazard Freres, and
                            that he was very pleased, after a week in New York, to see how
                            efficiently they had prepared the ground. He felt that one of the
                            advantages of floating a loan on the American market was the publicity
                            which the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> would receive in American
                            financial circles. The Secretary agreed that this education of American
                            banking circles regarding the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> was an
                            important by-product of the loan itself. <persName corresp="#p_MR1"
                                >Mayer</persName> expressed optimism with respect to the success of
                            the loan here, noting that the present outstanding loan obligations of
                            the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> amounted to some $125 million.
                            Even with full subscription of the $35 million loan, being floated in
                            New York this month, the total loan obligations would not amount to more
                            than approximately $160 million.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the two new European community treaties which had recently
                            been signed at Rome, the Secretary said that he was somewhat
                            disappointed in the lukewarm attitude of the British toward the Common
                            Market. M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> replied that he
                            was not surprised at British reluctance to see a true Common Market of
                            the Six, plus their African colonies, come into being.</p>
                        <p>What did surprise him was the British were surprised that the African
                            territories of France and Belgium should have been included. He went on
                            to say that it should have been obvious from the beginning that any
                            Western European Common Market would naturally have to include the
                            pertinent African colonies. He added that undoubtedly the British
                            realized that should the Common Market and <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >Euratom</gloss>, over a period of the next few years, become a
                            reality they would have created a “second Commonwealth”.</p>
                        <p>In response to the Secretary’s question, M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1"
                                >Mayer</persName> replied that he had good hope for French
                            ratification of the two new Community treaties before the summer recess.
                            He said some very flattering things about the present French Premier,
                            his ability to get things done and his greatly increased stature in
                            French politics over the past few years. In further support of his
                            optimism regarding ratification he added with a smile that, as an old
                            hand at French politics he was aware that there were certain elements in
                            the present government, hostile to <persName corresp="#p_MG2"
                                >Mollet</persName> but favorable to the two treaties, who would
                            press for their early ratification in order to get on with the more
                            serious business of bringing down <persName corresp="#p_MG2"
                                >Mollet</persName> himself. Finally, he cited the support of the
                            French peasants for the Common Market, because of the increased market
                            it will provide for agricultural products, as a favorable and entirely
                            new element in support of a European community treaty.</p>
                        <pb n="546" xml:id="pg_546" facs="0574"/>
                        <p>M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> reported to the Secretary
                            on a recent decision by the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> to
                            undertake a study of all conventional fuels (not only coal) within the
                            Community of Six. He said that this had passed by majority vote and over
                            the opposition of the Germans who did not seem to like the High
                            Authority looking into their private enterprises and fuel arrangements.
                            He said that between <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss>, when
                            it is finally established, and the Coal and Steel Community under its
                            new authorization, it would be possible to prepare a comprehensive
                            picture of European fuels both conventional and atomic which would
                            provide a very useful projection of the community’s needs for the years
                            immediately ahead. He would hope to draw Austria and Switzerland, as the
                            “water fortresses” of Europe, eventually into this cooperative
                            effort.</p>

                        <p>M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> expressed his pleasure at
                            the opportunity to meet the Under Secretary and to discuss with him
                            certain matters of mutual interest. The Under Secretary said that he had
                            heard much of M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> and the
                            work of the High Authority, and was equally delighted to have this
                            opportunity of meeting with M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1"
                                >Mayer</persName>.</p>
                        <p>M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> spoke generally of the
                            movement toward further European economic integration. He said that the
                            Six are “taking hold again”, as shown by the fact that the <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> and Common Market treaties were
                            successfully negotiated and were signed on March 25 in Rome. He
                            reaffirmed his own deep personal conviction of the need to carry forward
                            the creation of a genuine economic <pb n="547" xml:id="pg_547"
                                facs="0575"/>community in Western Europe. M. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> went on to speak of the work
                            accomplished by the Coal and Steel Community, as demonstrated by the
                            rapid expansion of steel output in the six countries, and the
                            “transformation” of the coal industry. He said that the High Authority
                            would be making a report on May 14 covering the progress made in the
                            first four years of the Community’s existence.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the projected new communities, he said that with respect to
                            the Common Market, he foresaw the need for the greatest patience and the
                            closest cooperation between the authorities of the Community itself and
                            the governments of the countries making up the Community. He remarked on
                            the fact that there will have to be more frequent meetings of Ministers
                            as they are given more power under the Common Market and <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> treaties than they have been
                            with respect to the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>. In this
                            connection, he observed that two of the most important practical
                            problems that arise in the operation of a community like the <gloss
                                target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> are the difficulties imposed by
                            language differences and the limited time Foreign Ministers can spend in
                            discussing and deciding questions affecting the Community. He said he
                            did not believe that deputies could fulfill this role. For example, the
                            High Authority of the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> does
                            practically all of the necessary staff work in presenting questions to
                            the Foreign Ministers. What falls to the Ministers is the task of making
                            political decisions, and in this role there can be no substitute for the
                            Ministers themselves. He ended his discussion of the Common Market by
                            saying he has no doubt it will come into being and operate
                            effectively.</p>
                        <p>Turning to <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>, M. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> said he believed that the
                            provision for a Commission of five members was preferable to the
                            nine-member High Authority of the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>.
                            He expressed the opinion that there will have to be close and direct
                            contacts between the High Authority of the <gloss target="#t_CSC1"
                                >CSC</gloss> and the Commissions of <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> and the Common Market.</p>
                        <p>He went on to say that he had been invited to attend the signing of the
                            Common Market and <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> treaties
                            in Rome on March 25 but unfortunately had not been able to attend
                            because of the pressure of work in connection with the High Authority’s
                            bond issue in the United States. He said that he had just learned that
                            the Foreign Ministers of the Six had decided in Rome to ask the High
                            Authority of the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> to undertake a
                            survey of how best to coordinate the policies of the six countries in
                            the field of conventional energy—oil, coal, etc. <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> would of course be performing
                            this same function in the field of atomic energy, and the cooperation of
                            the two bodies would provide the means for coordinating the policies of
                            the Six with respect to the entire field of energy. The Under Secretary
                            remarked upon the rapid changes that are occurring in the economics of
                            atomic power. M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> agreed and
                            said that of course <pb n="548" xml:id="pg_548" facs="0576"/>the
                            utilization of atomic energy as a source of electric power on a large
                            scale would come much sooner in Europe because of its higher cost of
                            power derived from conventional energy sources. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TBELIII1">Timmons</persName> inquired whether M.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> had yet formulated any
                            broad ideas as to how the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> study of
                            conventional energy might be carried out. M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1"
                                >Mayer</persName> replied that this subject had not yet been
                            discussed in the High Authority. He indicated that earlier there had
                            been some reluctance on the part of the six governments to entrust such
                            a study to the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss>. He went on to say
                            that the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> would probably wish to add
                            to its staff some qualified experts for the purpose of making the
                            conventional energy study, and that he anticipated it would take a
                            considerable period of time to complete such a study. He added that he
                            would hope to associate Switzerland and Austria with the study, and the
                                <gloss target="#t_UKG1">U.K.</gloss> as well. He referred in this
                            connection to the useful work already done in this field by the <gloss

                            latter’s colleagues on the High Authority fully approved the tentative
                            plan that had been discussed. The High Authority had suggested that the
                            pre-Easter meeting in Luxembourg take place on April 15 and 16 or April
                            16 and 17. The U.S. Government had also considered the matter and was
                            prepared to send representatives to Luxembourg for the discussions M.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> suggested. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TBELIII1">Timmons</persName> said that we would be
                            advising the High Authority through Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWW1">Butterworth</persName> of the names of the U.S.
                            representatives and the exact date on which we would be prepared to
                            begin the talks, i.e. the 15th or 16th. M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1"
                                >Mayer</persName> expressed his appreciation for the very prompt
                            response by the U.S. Government to his suggestion.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary then referred to the High Authority’s forthcoming
                            bond issue in the United States. M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1"
                                >Mayer</persName> said that he [was] extremely satisfied with the
                            work of the American investment houses handling the issue, and thought
                            one of the useful by-products <pb n="549" xml:id="pg_549" facs="0577"
                            />of the <gloss target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> loan in the U.S. would be a
                            wider dissemination in the U.S. of information on the <gloss
                                target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> and its financial operations.</p>
                        <p>In closing, M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> said that he
                            had seen the Secretary of State on April 3 and that among other subjects
                            they had discussed the “reluctance” of the British to see a true common
                            market, including the overseas territories of the six countries, come
                            into being. M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Mayer</persName> said that he
                            was surprised that the British were only now awakening to the fact that
                            it was politically necessary to include the overseas territories of the
                            six countries in the common market. He also remarked that neither France
                            nor Italy could go into a common market that excluded agricultural
                            products. He reverted to the prospects that such a common market would
                            open up and said the result could be a “second commonwealth”, an
                            association between Europe and Africa that would hold out great promise
                            for the future of both these regions of the world. Finally, he said that
                            he was sure that the U.S. Government appreciated the paramount political
                            importance of not allowing any rift to develop in <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> between the Six countries and the
                            other members of <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. Such a rift
                            could create a very deep division in the Atlantic community, and he
                            hoped that the U.S. Government would indicate to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UKG1">U.K.</gloss> the political importance the U.S.
                            attaches to the Common Market and to the necessity of avoiding any such
                            division.</p>

                                with respect to such provisions. A broad recognition of the
                                interests of third countries is contained in the provision that the

                                third countries, including the United States. It is impracticable at
                                this stage to obtain changes in the Common Market Treaty without
                                jeopardizing the chances of the establishment of the Community.
                                Extensive formal consideration of the Treaty by the Contracting
                                Parties to the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> prior to
                                ratification could seriously interfere with favorable parliamentary
                                action. Moreover, a more meaningful decision on the matters to be
                                resolved would be possible in the better negotiating atmosphere that
                                would exist after ratification of the Treaty. For these reasons, the
                                United States has been proceeding on the assumption that the best
                                time to have definitive consideration of the Treaty would be after
                                its ratification. At the same time, the Six governments have been
                                urged to avoid making commitments which would prejudice <gloss

                            returned from Luxembourg, on the report of the <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> Wise Men is equally
                            encouraging. The Government of the United States hopes to continue to
                            cooperate with the Six Nations individually in the atomic energy field
                            in the immediate future, while anticipating even more extensive
                            cooperation with <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> when the
                            Community comes into being.</p>
                        <p>On February 1, 1957 the French and Italian Ambassadors and the Chargé
                            d’Affaires ad interim of the Federal Republic of Germany advised the
                            Department of State of the discussion of their Governments with the
                            other Governments participating in the Brussels Conference and informed
                            the Department of State of the consensus reached that the three nations
                            should proceed to negotiate interim bilateral power reactor agreements
                            with the Government of the United States, to cover the period prior to
                            the establishment of <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>. The
                            representatives indicated that nothing in the negotiations would
                            prejudice <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> and that the
                            bilateral agreements that resulted would be designed to come within the
                            ambit of <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> when the Community
                            came into being. The United States Government understands that a primary
                            purpose of these agreements is to meet fuel requirements for reactors
                            which would otherwise be delayed unless bilateral agreements were
                            negotiated to cover the interim period.</p>
                        <p>Preliminary negotiations have been conducted by representatives of this
                            Government with representatives of France, Germany, and Italy. The
                            United States believes it to be consistent with the February 1, 1957
                            approach to continue joint consideration of the prospective bilateral
                            agreements. The Government of the United States, therefore, is making
                            available at this time essentially identical draft bilateral power
                            agreements for further consideration by and negotiation with the three
                            Governments.</p>
                        <p>In addition to welcoming any questions regarding the substantive
                            provisions of these draft agreements, the United States would appreciate
                            clarification of the intentions of the three Governments concerning
                            these interim agreements. It is the understanding of the United States,
                            on the basis of the meeting of February 1, 1957, that these agreements
                            were intended to provide the fuel assurance for defined reactor projects
                            which would otherwise be delayed during the transitional period pending
                            the establishment of the Community, and the negotiation of an
                            arrangement between <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> and the
                            United States. However, in addition to covering such defined <pb n="555"
                                xml:id="pg_555" facs="0583"/>projects, the fuel requests which have
                            been received thus far from the three Governments appear to relate to
                            some reactor projects that would be initiated after the time when it is
                            expected that <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> would be in
                            operation. For example, the tentative requests put forward would require
                            an allocation by the United States on the basis of our preliminary
                            analysis, of from 8,000 to 10,000 kilograms of U–235, and are based on
                            the assumption that the bilateral agreements would run for a decade.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the Government of the United States wishes to express
                            again its deep interest in furthering reactor projects during the
                            interim period and particularly by providing through bilateral
                            agreements assurances regarding the availability of necessary
                            fissionable material. In further negotiations regarding the draft
                            agreements made available today, the Government of the United States
                            would welcome advice regarding interpretation of the proposal made by
                            the three Governments on February 1, 1957 in order to facilitate the
                            early conclusion of agreements for cooperation for the mutual benefit of
                            the three nations and the United States. The United States Government is
                            particularly anxious that these agreements be brought into force before
                            the adjournment of the current session of the United States
                                Congress.”<note n="2" xml:id="d235fn2">On May 21, Deputy Under

                            companies participated in the round-table discussion, including such
                            firms as Borg-Warner International, The Chase Manhattan Bank, Dupont,
                            Ford Motor, Standard Oil of New Jersey, Westinghouse, etc. Two major
                            conclusions emerged: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Practically all firms expected that the impact of the common
                                    market and free trade area, both short-run and long-run, would
                                    be to discourage rather than encourage U.S. exports of
                                    manufactured products to Europe. This view was based only in
                                    part on the discrimination against the U.S. inherent in these
                                    arrangements; mostly it was based on the expectation of a
                                    tremendous impetus to European productivity and a consequent
                                    lesser need to rely on manufactured goods from this
                                    country.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>The group was virtually unanimous in the view that the common
                                    market and free trade area will encourage the trend already
                                    under way for U.S. manufacturers to invest abroad through
                                    branches and subsidiaries. Some planning is already under way on
                                    this basis. The representative for Ford International, for
                                    example, pointed out that of their one billion dollars of sales
                                    in Europe the vast bulk results from production by Ford in
                                    Europe. Apparently the long-term planners in the company are
                                    already thinking in terms of a tremendous increase in the
                                    potential demand for their products once the impact of the new
                                    developments has worked itself out. The prospect of a high
                                    income market of over 250 million people unimpeded by internal
                                    trade barriers and surrounded by barriers against outsiders is
                                    apparently looked upon as a juicy opportunity for direct
                                    investment abroad by U.S. manufacturers.</item>

                        <p>In a talk with <persName corresp="#p_MRE1">Robert Marjolin</persName>
                            yesterday, I mentioned the stimulus that the new developments have given
                            to the long-range thinking of U.S. industry with respect to the

                                corresp="#p_MRE1">Marjolin</persName> said he was quite unaware of
                            the extent to which American industry was thinking in these terms and
                            that such an accelerated flow of American capital to Europe (with its
                            attendant technology and expansionist business policies) could well be
                            one of the principal forces making for increases in European output and
                            productivity. He said he was quite sure that the Europeans with whom he
                            was closely associated in drafting the treaty did not adequately
                            appreciate this point. While himself reacting enthusiastically to this
                            prospect, he pleaded that we refrain from giving any publicity prior to
                            French ratification to American industry’s anticipations with regard to
                            new investment in Europe. He was sure French business would be
                            frightened by this prospect and that other groups in France would be
                            convinced that American firms establishing new plants within the common
                            market and free trade area would be apt to favor investments in
                            countries other than France.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary asked the Chancellor to speak on the fifth Agenda item,
                            owing to his great interest in the subject and all that he had done on
                            behalf of European integration.<note n="2" xml:id="d237fn2"><persName
                                    corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> was in the United States
                                for an official 6-day visit, May 24–29.</note></p>
                        <p>The Chancellor said there would be no difficulty as far as Germany was
                            concerned and he was confident that <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> and the Common Markets would be ratified by the
                            Bundestag in July before the summer recess. He was, however, concerned
                            by the situation in Italy and France. In France, in particular, a
                            prolongation of the government crisis could cause difficulties. No one
                            could change this, however, and we must await developments. There was
                            one case in which he felt the United States could help, namely, that of
                            the Netherlands. The Dutch were planning to take up the ratification
                            question only after the summer recess, and there was a danger that other
                            countries might also wait for action of the Netherlands. If the Dutch
                            could move faster it would benefit all of us. The Chancellor again
                            affirmed that in Germany there was no problem and he was sure that the
                            agreements would be ratified by a large majority.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he had found the statement on this subject in the
                            communiqué on the <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>
                                talks<note n="3" xml:id="d237fn3"><persName corresp="#p_MH1"
                                    >Macmillan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                                    >Adenauer</persName> held a series of discussions in Bonn
                                between May 7 and 9.</note> very good and that it represented an
                            advance over the position taken by the British earlier. He <pb n="558"
                                xml:id="pg_558" facs="0586"/>was a bit surprised, however, over the
                            Chancellor’s concern regarding Italy. He inquired if this was because of
                            the governmental crisis.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor asked Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von
                                Brentano</persName> to comment on this point. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH1">Brentano</persName> said that as regards Italy he
                            believed the new Italian government<note n="4" xml:id="d237fn4">On May
                                6, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName>
                                resigned; <persName corresp="#p_ZA1">Adone Zoli</persName> formed a
                                new government on May 19.</note> if confirmed in office would try to
                            secure ratification with the support of parties not in the government.
                            He was more concerned about France, even though there presently appeared
                            to be a majority in the French Parliament for the agreements. If the
                            governmental crisis were drawn out, mounting disagreements and tensions
                            over other problems, such as Algeria, could have an adverse effect on
                            ratification. He was, nevertheless, still optimistic over the outlook.
                            As for England the British position, as the Secretary had indicated, had
                            been clarified in the Bonn talks with Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> and Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Lloyd</persName>. The British had made it clear
                            that they would no longer try to have the free trade area question
                            settled prior to ratification of the common market; also that they were
                            willing to postpone further discussion of the Grand Design, which could
                            have interfered with ratification.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brentano</persName> said that he hoped the
                            United States would continue to be helpful in <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                >GATT</gloss> when the Common Market plan was discussed there. It
                            was expected other nations would cause difficulties with the Common
                            Market plan. He referred to a similar tendency in <gloss
                                target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> to attack the <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> agreement. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH1">Brentano</persName> said the support of the United
                            States Government would be welcomed in trying to get discussion of these
                            questions deferred until after ratification.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that there was no doubt that the fall of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_MG2">Mollet</persName> government<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d237fn5">Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MG2"
                                    >Mollet</persName> resigned on May 21.</note> would have a bad
                            effect on the attitude of other countries, such as Italy. Certainly the
                            United States would do all it could in any quarter to assist this matter
                            forward. He had repeatedly emphasized to the French his opinion that
                            failure on their part to ratify the Common Market and <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> agreements, following on the
                            defeat of <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss>, would have a catastrophic
                            effect on United States attitudes toward Europe. As for the Netherlands,
                            he would be glad to look into the matter. He was aware that under Dutch
                            constitutional requirements the ratification process was ponderous and
                            slow-moving, and it might be hard to stir them into any speedier
                                action.<note n="6" xml:id="d237fn6">On May 28, at the conclusion of

                                        Common Market treaties was a subject which should not be
                                        broached before the French had taken action on these
                                        treaties due to the delicate political situation in France.
                                        The present government in France, the Embassy noted, was
                                        “pro-European”, but was “essentially minority one of fragile
                                        and perhaps transitory nature.” The present majority in
                                        Parliament in favor of ratification of the treaties could
                                        diminish rapidly, the Embassy cautioned, if time was lost or
                                        if France’s financial position deteriorated further. (<hi

                        <p>The Foreign Minister opened the conversation by stating that he had to
                            return in the near future to the Netherlands for the parliamentary
                            debate on the ratification of the <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> and Common Market Treaties. He anticipated no
                            difficulty in passage but there were certain rather tedious
                            parliamentary forms which must be gone through. He expressed the
                            gratitude of the six powers for the United States attitude on the
                            Treaties, especially as some Europeans have been worried that the United
                            States might oppose them. The Secretary acknowledged that some people in
                            the United States have been worried about the possible effect of the
                            treaty operation on United States exports. However, taking the long
                            view, we feel that regardless of any temporary disadvantage to the
                            United States the treaties give good prospect of increasing the standard
                            of living in the treaty area and any raise in living standard in one
                            area of the free world redounds to the benefit of that world as a whole.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJMAH1">Luns</persName> characterized the
                            treaties as more trade creating than trade diverting. He said the Dutch
                            would make some sacrifices under the treaty provisions, however, they
                            expected good results in the long run.</p>

                            issues relating to the Common Market and Free Trade Area. The following
                            broadly summarizes the views expressed by Sir <persName
                                corresp="#p_BDKE1">David</persName> in this connection:</p>
                        <pb n="563" xml:id="pg_563" facs="0591"/>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                                and the Common Market</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DGD1">Dillon</persName> emphasized our interest
                            in supporting the development of the Common Market and mentioned the
                            problem of finding a suitable way of relating the Common Market to
                                <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> principles in order to prevent
                            the creation of an inward-looking, protectionist trading area in Western
                            Europe. He mentioned some of the difficulties involved in getting the
                            Six to agree to a waiver under <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> (as
                            they apparently feel there is nothing to be waived). Sir <persName
                                corresp="#p_BDKE1">David</persName> felt that it might be possible
                            for some form of “watch” committee to be formed within <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> to ensure that the Common Market
                            develops in consonance with <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                            principles. He suggested the desirability of our exchanging views on
                            these issues with <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> representatives
                            prior to the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> Session and mentioned
                                <persName>Cyril Sanders</persName> as the man with whom these
                            questions should be discussed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DGD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> agreed that this would be useful and
                            desirable.</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">David</persName> said that he understood
                            that there were serious issues emerging within the Six over the “German
                            problem” (including the mark-franc relationship) which could conceivably
                            delay the entry into force of the Common Market and remarked (with some
                            humor) that because of this perhaps the <gloss target="#t_FTA1"
                                >FTA</gloss> would come into being in advance of the Common Market.
                            The fact that Germany is not behaving like a “good creditor” loomed as a
                            large problem, he felt, and any conviction on the part of the French
                            that they could “deal” with Germany on the side in the hope that this
                            would result in bringing other members of the Six into conformity was
                            unrealistic. He was much impressed, he continued, with the view of a
                            Portuguese “elder statesman” that complete Franco-German harmony “is too
                            violent for history”.</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">David</persName> doubted that the Six
                            knew what was meant by an “organized agricultural market” and that in
                            any event the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> could probably not
                            participate in any such organized market because it would undoubtedly
                            result in higher food prices to British consumers.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Free Trade Area</hi></p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> is very much in favor of a Free
                            Trade Area but cannot participate in it if injury to the Commonwealth is
                            likely to result. The Commonwealth is very worried indeed over the
                            question of the possible inclusion of agricultural products, just as the
                            Latin American countries are concerned over the possible adverse effects
                            of the Common Market on their export trade. In response to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGD1">Dillon</persName>’s question on timing, Sir
                                <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">David</persName> said that he thought
                            that the <gloss target="#t_FTA1">FTA</gloss> problem would ultimately
                            have to go to the Prime Minister, possibly in November, and that the
                            issues might be expected to be settled, one way or the other, by January
                            1958.</p>

                        <p>The meeting was held at the request of Kohnstamm in order to discuss to
                            what extent and in what way it might be possible, after the formation of
                                <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>, to initiate a joint
                            program of cooperation between the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> for speeding the development of nuclear power in
                            Europe. Kohnstamm is anxious to ensure that <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                                >EURATOM</gloss> gets off to a flying start and does not become
                            bogged down at its inception by numerous organizational and legal
                            problems. Furthermore, he is concerned that, without outside stimulus
                            from the U.S. there will be relatively few U.S.-type reactors
                            constructed in Europe and the trend will be strongly toward the natural
                            uranium-graphite type of reactor. He feels that, from the point of view
                            both of diversification and of rapid development, it is critically
                            important that there be a comparable development of water-type reactors
                            in Europe. With this in mind, Kohnstamm has in recent weeks been
                            forwarding the concept of a “joint demonstration program” whereby <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> and the United States might
                            perhaps share (on a roughly equal basis) in the costs required to
                            construct, say, four “demonstration power reactors” at the earliest
                            possible date. The suggested reactors would include one of each of the
                            major types of interest: i.e., a pressurized-water reactor, a boiling
                            water reactor, a <pb n="567" xml:id="pg_567" facs="0595"/>heavy-water
                            natural-uranium reactor, and a gas-cooled natural-uranium reactor.</p>
                        <p>It was a concept of this type which Kohnstamm wished to consider at the
                            Luxembourg meeting, and he brought to the meeting an agenda of
                            discussion topics based around this idea.</p>
                        <p>In the discussions which ensued, there was general agreement on the basic
                            principles—i.e., that the <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>
                            programs get off to a strong start and that it have a diversified
                            program. However, the method forwarded by Kohnstamm for achieving these
                            goals was challenged from the outset.</p>
                        <p>The view was forwarded, particularly by Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWW1">Butterworth</persName>, that the prime mover in
                            the <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> program must be Europe
                            itself, and that while the United States was ready and willing to assist
                            and speed its development in every reasonable way, it was not
                            appropriate to consider the United States as one of its two legs.
                            Rather, the <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> program must
                            stand on its own feet and develop its own program, albeit with the
                            assurance of strong cooperation and assistance from the United States
                            (and hopefully also from Great Britain and Canada).</p>
                        <p>In addition, as pointed out by <persName>Vander Weyden</persName> and
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWW1">Butterworth</persName>, it is not
                            reasonable to anticipate that the United States would be willing to
                            provide substantial financial support toward the construction in Europe
                            of “demonstration reactors” involving types not under active development
                            in the U.S. In particular, it seems difficult to believe the U.S. would
                            contribute substantial amounts to the construction in Europe of a

                                    with the result that reactor operating costs can be estimated

                                    provide firm prices for this critically important component; the
                                    consequent inability of European groups to estimate operating

                        <p>The following is verbatim text of the opening session of the Chiefs of
                            Mission Conference, May 6, 1957, at 10:00 a.m.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Houghton</persName>: Mr. Secretary
                            and distinguished guests. I believe it says in the Bible that the first
                            will be last and the last will be first, and this is ample evidence that
                            the Ambassador will be first to talk. I assure you it will be very brief
                            as we have a full agenda. What I do wish to say is that it is a great
                            pleasure for me to welcome you all to Paris. All of us here in the
                            Embassy hope that you will call on us if there is anything that we can
                            do to make your stay here pleasant and we are hopeful, of course, that
                            this meeting will be both rewarding and enjoyable.</p>
                        <p>We have the great honor of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName> honoring us at the opening meeting. Without
                            further ado, Mr. Secretary, I shall turn the meeting over to you.</p>
                        <p>Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>: I am
                            very happy indeed that this meeting coincided with the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Meeting so that I might be able to be
                                here.<note n="2" xml:id="d249fn2">See <ref target="#d248fn4"
                                    >footnote 4, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi></ref>.</note> It is
                            the first time in the last four years, I think, that I have attended any
                            such meeting. Perhaps these meetings have not been held as frequently as
                            it might be desirable. I hope that if this meeting proves useful there
                            can be more of them. I will talk for a few minutes, if I may, and if you
                            have some questions. If we don’t finish the questions this morning, I
                            will try to come back for a while this afternoon.</p>
                        <p>First of all, I want to refer to the foreign policy speech which I made
                            on April 22 a couple of weeks ago.<note n="3" xml:id="d249fn3">For text
                                of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>’ speech
                                before the Associated Press at New York City, April 22, 1957, see
                                Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, May 6, 1957,
                                pp. 715–719.</note> I know that you all have a great deal of reading
                            matter and are in the main kept busy by the particular problems of the
                            day, but I do want to suggest that when occasionally speeches of that
                            kind are made that you try to find the time to study them if you can
                            rather carefully, because they are very carefully studied at home before
                            they are made and deserve, I think, considerable study by our
                            ambassadors as indicating the basic principles on which we try to
                            operate our foreign policy. A speech like this, I suppose, goes through
                            about 15 drafts. The speech had been gone over by the President in one
                            of its early drafts and then he went over the next to final draft again.
                            Every word in it was carefully weighed and there is, I think, more in it
                            than is apparent in casual reading. I mention this not because I am the
                            primary author of this <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0603"/>speech
                            and am trying to develop a captive audience but, I think, from the
                            standpoint of basic philosophy these things are occasionally useful.</p>
                        <p>There is one passage in the speech which I could perhaps elaborate on a
                            little bit because for reasons of policy we did not elaborate quite as
                            fully as we might have. That is the section which deals with the
                            principle of the United Nations Charter and our Suez Policy.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d249fn4"><p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                        >Dulles</persName> said:</p>
                                <p>“Our dedication to the principles of the United Nations Charter
                                    was severely tested by the recent Middle East crisis. We were
                                    then faced with a distressing and unprecedented conflict of
                                    loyalties. Historic ties would have led us to acquiesce in the
                                    forcible action that was begun. But this would have involved
                                    disloyalty to the United Nations undertaking that all members
                                    renounce the use of force except in defense against armed
                                    attack. That same pledge is also embodied in all our treaties of
                                    alliance. We decided to be loyal to that commitment.</p>
                                <p>“This was a hard decision, although to those directly affected it
                                    was not an unexpected decision. It was not, I suppose, a popular
                                    decision. Yet it was imperative if the world was not to go as it
                                    went when the League Convenant was disregarded.</p>
                                <p>“But, as we have seen, the charter prescribes not merely peaceful
                                    settlement but settlement in conformity with justice and
                                    international law.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, p.
                                718)</p></note> We passed over somewhat lightly that section of the
                            speech because we did not want to stir up certain differences which we
                            hope will as quickly as possible be buried in the future cooperation.
                            But there are some references there which perhaps can stand a little
                            elaboration.</p>
                        <p>We said that our decision at that time was a hard decision, particularly
                            the language which President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> chose to express that thought and, of course,
                            he referred to his own communications with Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> and Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_MG2">Mollet</persName> which made it emphatically clear
                            in advance that the United States would not cooperate in the use of
                            force, and he believed and he expressed very clearly the reason why he
                            believed it would be a disastrous course for the British and the French
                            to follow.<note n="5" xml:id="d249fn5">For text of President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s address to the Nation,
                                October 31, 1956, see <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, November 12,
                                1956, pp. 743–745.</note> Then the next sentence goes on and I
                            suppose it was not a popular decision. I originally elaborated on that a
                            little bit. What I meant to say was this: it is rarely popular to show
                            loyalty to a principle. A loyalty which deserves greater popularity is
                            to its country and a loyalty to a principle is a kind of vague
                            abstraction and does not attract the same type of loyalty which
                            expresses itself in terms more to figures or to particular
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>But I believe that a nation which has the world wide responsibilities of
                            the United States cannot discharge them adequately unless it tries to be
                            loyal to certain principles and not express its policies in terms of
                            likes or dislikes of certain countries. Now it is certainly not popular
                            in the United States to adopt a policy which at the same time
                            antagonizes the friends of Britain, the friends of France and the <pb
                                n="576" xml:id="pg_576" facs="0604"/>friends of Israel. Certainly,
                            that was one of the hardest decisions that was ever made by a head of a
                            government, to make that kind of decision. But it is basic in our
                            Charter commitment and in our treaty commitments, our alliances, to make
                            the first article of our treaties starting with <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> provide that none of the members will use force except
                            in case of self-defense or in accordance with the principles of the
                            United Nations Charter. Now when you have an alliance and you base it on
                            that principle, it seems just as important if only for the standpoint of
                            the dependability of the alliances that Article 1 of the alliance shall
                            be lived up to, and if that one is not lived up to how are you going to
                            depend on other members living up to the other articles of the
                            treaty?</p>
                        <p>Then we have a problem outside of Europe which preoccupies us and where
                            we have to invoke the same principles. For a long time and still today
                            President Syngman Rhee has wanted to correct what he regards as a
                            terrible injustice committed on the Koreans by Communist forces and we
                            have had to exert the strongest kind of pressure on him not to invoke
                            force. And he isn’t even bound by the United Nations Charter in that
                            respect.</p>
                        <p>We have similar problems with Chiang Kai-shek on Taiwan. We cannot have
                            one principle for Europe and another for Asia. I am quite sure that the
                            countries of Europe would be aghast if we should encourage the use of
                            force.</p>
                        <p>The only principle we can hold them back with is the same principle
                            expressed in the United Nations Charter, and in Article 1 of the North
                            Atlantic Treaty. That illustrates what I mean when a country with world
                            wide responsibilities has the necessity of being loyal to principles
                            even though that is not nearly as attractive popularly as being popular
                            and loyal to personal and international friendships.</p>
                        <p>When I was in Australia last month,<note n="6" xml:id="d249fn6">Secretary
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> was in Canberra,
                                Australia, to attend the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>
                                Council meeting, March 10–13, 1957.</note> I think it was, I was
                            talking to <persName corresp="#p_MRG1">Menzies</persName><note n="7"
                                xml:id="d249fn7"><persName corresp="#p_MRG1">Robert G.
                                    Menzies</persName>, Australian Prime Minister.</note> about this
                            question of loyalty. I was reminded of how we do recognize our standards
                            of loyalty within our family. The first loyalty is the husband to the
                            wife and wife to husband, and that is recognized by law as a husband and
                            a wife cannot testify against each other. And I said to <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRG1">Menzies</persName>, you are so intimate and a part
                            of the British family, so to speak, and I can understand your sticking
                            along with the British. But, I said, a nation like the United States
                            with a world wide responsibility has got to put its principles ahead of
                            any one or more nations.</p>
                        <pb n="577" xml:id="pg_577" facs="0605"/>
                        <p>Now there is also a question I want to refer to here which I would like
                            to elaborate a little bit more on and that is our attitude toward the
                            United Nations. There is quite a general feeling I think in Western
                            Europe that the United Nations has proved a failure and that it operates
                            against the countries of Western Europe, and that the less success there
                            is for the United Nations so much the better for the world or at least
                            the countries of Western Europe. We do not share that view at all. We
                            recognize the infirmities of the United Nations. Indeed, we have tried
                            to correct those infirmities at an early stage and we were unable to get
                            any support from our Western European friends at that time. It was a
                            question of voting on the United Nations Assembly, a matter on which I
                            expressed myself before I was Secretary of State. And we hope that we
                            might develop some way or system of voting in the Assembly. We tried to
                            get a new charter but we were blocked by a solid front who did not want
                            to remedy. We were not in favor of bringing all these blocs of
                            countries, sort of a package-deal, in as new members in the United
                            Nations a couple of years ago. Each country ought to be appraised on its
                            merits. And all the new countries ought not to be brought in before they
                            had demonstrated that they had the ability to live up to the provisions
                            of the Charter, and certainly the Soviet Bloc countries have not
                            demonstrated that. Again enlarged membership is something about which
                            they now complain but they were backing it and we were opposing, and we
                            went along not only out of desire not to oppose but because they were
                            all in favor of it.</p>

                                1957. A memorandum of their discussion on the United Nations is
                                scheduled for publication in a forthcoming <hi rend="italic">Foreign

                            Charter and I believe that it should be done.</p>
                        <p>I recall when we had a little trouble with Guatemala it was the British
                            in the Security Council which opposed our dealing with that matter in
                            the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> and who insisted that that
                            should have been done through the United Nations, and I said to the
                            greatest extent possible the disputes between members of regional
                            alliances ought to be settled there. That is what the Charter says, to
                            try to settle disputes according to regional procedures.</p>
                        <p>And we, of course, have long advocated the development of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in that respect more along the lines
                            of the Organization of American States with more adequate machinery for
                            dealing with disputes so that they will be dealt with in that context
                            instead of being more or less automatically brought to the United
                            Nations.</p>

                        <p>Now we still, despite the difficulties of the United Nations, have faith
                            in the United Nations and I do not believe that there is in fact a “pat”
                            vote against the countries of Western Europe. Certainly, there was no
                            pat vote on the Hungarian issue. We got almost an overwhelming vote
                            except for the Soviet Bloc.<note n="9" xml:id="d249fn9">Reference is to

                        <p>On the two issues of Cyprus and Algeria, which perhaps afforded a good
                            test of that, it was possible to end up this last assembly with
                            resolutions which were unanimously adopted and accepted by the colonial
                            powers and so-called Afro-Asian bloc. And while it is somewhat anomalous
                            to have simply one vote for a nation, I feel there is still a judgment
                            exercised. There is no automatic voting by regional blocs.</p>
                        <p>The Italians suggested that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            countries have a caucus in the <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UN</gloss>. I
                            suggested that that ought to be approached with the greatest possible
                            caution because if the Western European countries organize a bloc, it
                            will become even more difficult to influence the views of some of the
                            new members.</p>
                        <p>And on the question of what I said on April 22, it has been charged that
                            it is not a foreign policy merely to dump something in the United
                            Nations. Of course I recognize the fact that we have never done that.
                            The United States has never followed that policy. As far as the Suez
                            matter is concerned, the resolution to cease fire<note n="10"

                            was a resolution based on U.S. policy, drafted by us on the airplane
                            going up—it was a U.S. policy. To use the United Nations and its Charter
                            as a means of effectuating a policy is not an abdication by any means of
                            foreign policy. I have taken perhaps some time to discuss this matter
                            but it does reflect an area where there is a sharp divergence between
                            the views of the Western European countries and the United States and
                            perhaps deserves more attention.</p>
                        <p>Now I will go on to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting at
                            Bonn. It was a good meeting and in many respects the best meeting we
                            have had in recent times. I have personally attended every such meeting
                            for the last four and a half years and there was a total of about 13
                            ministerial meetings, I think. And I think we came nearer to having a
                            really informal exchange of views of important matters than there has
                            been before. As one Minister put it, in the past there has been a
                            tendency to bringing pre-digested speeches which were directed at each
                            other. Even the matter of Cyprus for the first time was talked about. It
                            was <pb n="579" xml:id="pg_579" facs="0607"/>sort of an unwritten law
                            that nobody would mention Cyprus, that nobody mentions the word. This
                            time there was an exchange of views between the Greeks and the Turks and
                            the British and we got to work without the roof being blown off.</p>
                        <p>The most interesting aspect of the meeting, I think, from our standpoint
                            was the view expressed there on the question of limitation of armaments.
                            There seemed to be a sentiment which, as far as we could judge, was
                            shared by the Western European countries other than the Federal Republic
                            that we should go very slowly about any limitation of nuclear weapons.
                            And we should not accept any limitation of nuclear weapons unless it was
                            100% fool-proof, and in any event not do it until we could be certain at
                            the same time there would be a corresponding limitation of conventional
                            weapons. Now it seems to be assumed in some quarters that it is easier
                            to limit conventional weapons than it is nuclear weapons. I doubt very
                            much if that is the case. I think it is the other way around. The
                            striking of a balance in respect to conventional weapons is a more
                            difficult and complicated proceeding. As demonstrated by the years
                            following the first world war, there were allies who really had a good
                            deal of confidence with each other, worked in good faith and intensity
                            for several years to work out and measure and equate conventional
                            armaments, and that effort proved unavailing.</p>
                        <p>The simple tendency today is to talk of manpower. That is the most
                            meaningless thing to talk about. You take people and have them trained,
                            take them out, and you might at one time have two and one-half million
                            men under arms but you may have seven or eight or ten million standing
                            by thoroughly trained and ready; if they have the arms to pick up, they
                            can at once convert an army of two and one-half million to an army of
                            ten million. As was recognized when we drew the limitations, when we
                            drew up the Brussels Treaty, the only limitation is of weapons rather
                            than men. When it says the Germans shall not have more than 12
                            divisions, the implication is that the arms for more divisions shall be
                            denied. So it is recognized that if you don’t have arms for 12 divisions
                            it doesn’t do much good to have more men trained for military service.
                            So the emphasis is on the armaments and not on the men.</p>
                        <p>When you try to get this question of manpower and arms figured down, it
                            is an almost impossible task and I do not feel optimistic about the
                            ability to arrive at an acceptable agreement about conventional weapons.
                            Perhaps something could be arrived at governing where and how they could
                            be stationed. But it is an immensely difficult thing.</p>
                        <p>When you get into the field of nuclear weapons, at least we have the fact
                            that only three nations have these weapons, and while it is true that
                            present scientific data does not enable you to account <pb n="580"
                                xml:id="pg_580" facs="0608"/>for and therefore control all of the
                            fissionable material which has been produced in the past, it is more
                            possible to control the means for the delivery of that material in
                            weapons form, in terms of missiles, in terms of long range bombers and
                            in terms of submarines. Those things cannot be concealed as would be
                            possible in the case of conventional weapons. It would be possible to
                            have a considerable control over the new use at least of fissionable
                            material for weapons and possible for a much more complete control of
                            delivery of those at a distance.</p>
                        <p>I emphasize “at a distance” as being a principal factor because we do not
                            think the Soviets would start an atomic war unless they felt there was a
                            good possibility of knocking out the United States to a considerable
                            extent in the first phase of such an attack. I do not think the Soviets
                            would start an atomic war against its neighbors which left the United
                            States undamaged and its military potential undiminished. It is
                            extremely unlikely they would do that.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out there at the meeting that, of course, we are dealing with a
                            risk, and it is not possible to find a course totally free of risk. The
                            question of the effect of atomic war on populations is not a question of
                            millions but of tens of millions. Life on the northern half of the globe
                            would be totally extinct. When you think of that you can’t contemplate
                            the continued existence of that threat as other than a risk. And to say
                            you will not tackle the problem unless you can solve all related
                            problems at the same time seems to me an error of judgment, and as I
                            said there the thing that seems for us to do is try to control what is
                            controllable and not try to control everything when everything cannot be
                            controlled.</p>
                        <p>I suspect that although they didn’t admit it in concrete terms, the
                            Western Europeans rather like the protection afforded by the nuclear
                            power of the United States partly because in conventional armaments the
                            greatest dependence of Western Europe for security against the USSR
                            would automatically be on the West Germans, both because of their
                            geographic position and because of their potential.</p>
                        <p>So it looks as though there would be some opportunity for agreement and
                            although for the moment the disarmament talks do not show prospects of
                            settling all the differences between us, to the extent they exist, they
                            have a practical importance.</p>
                        <p>We talked in Bonn about political cooperation, of course, and indeed our
                            meeting exhibited the greater political aspects which we think are
                            possible and desirable within the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            Council. We hope perhaps that when Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1"

                                xml:id="pg_581" facs="0609"/>Cyprus matter which really cries out
                            for a solution at the present time. It is an extremely disruptive
                            element. I think the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> is now in a mood
                            where it would accept any solution which the Greeks and the Turks would
                            take. And the decision is now primarily between the Greeks and the
                            Turks. I think somebody will have to lay the law down and say this is it
                            and put pressure on it.</p>
                        <p>The Greeks indicated to me that they were disposed to let <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> study this matter, although they
                            were anxious that he should study it privately until he should be able
                            to satisfy himself that he could find some solution. My guess is that
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> given his temperament
                            would be rather disposed to get into this problem. Perhaps it is just as
                            well to have someone like him get into it.</p>
                        <p>I talked at considerable length at the Council meeting about developments
                            in the Middle East, and perhaps that might be of interest to you. I can
                            speak even a little more frankly here than I did at the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council. The United States had
                            abstained from having any positive policy in that area of its own
                            because it had accepted that that is an area where the <gloss
                                target="#t_UKG1">UK</gloss> had the primary role. We have not been
                            filled with admiration with the way the British have played that role in
                            recent years. It seems to us to have been characteristic of a nation
                            which, realizing that it was weak, felt it had to act as though it was
                            strong, and its actions, for instance, in seizing the Buraimi Oasis, the
                            step taken to try to force Jordan into the Baghdad Pact,<note n="12"

                            When the abortive Suez action pretty much brought the British influence
                            in the area for the time being to a rather low level, we felt that the

                            It seemed to us that King <persName corresp="#p_SIAAFS1">Saud</persName>
                            was a natural rival for <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in

                            religion, having the custody of the holy places of Islam, and that the
                            new orientation of the Arab world might be found through King <persName

                            young man, barely 22 years old. He perceived the nature of the plot and
                            told us of his plans for dealing with it on the assumption that he could
                            get certain amount of help and support from the United States. … He
                            wanted to be sure that if there was overt Soviet intervention we would

                            prepared to move overtly in the area. The fact of the matter was that
                            King <persName corresp="#p_Hussein1">Hussein</persName> felt that there
                            was a danger and it was necessary to reassure him that we would be

                        <p>King <persName corresp="#p_Hussein1">Hussein</persName> then was

                            set back and a drawing together of other Arab countries because in the
                            course of this King <persName corresp="#p_SIAAFS1">Saud</persName> has
                            recognized that Iraq was a more dependable friend than Egypt or Syria,
                            and there is improvement in the relations between King <persName

                            Jordan, so that there is a considerable isolation at the moment of Egypt
                            and Syria. And the North African Arab countries also are aligned more
                            closely in the anti-Egyptian element.</p>
                        <p>The United States, as you know, indicated in an early stage that we would
                            be prepared to identify ourselves with the military committee of the
                            Baghdad Pact and that invitation will probably come forward at the
                            meeting which is scheduled to be held in Karachi at the end of this
                            month, I think, and we will be represented at that meeting.<note n="18"

                        <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>I referred in my speech on the 22nd of last month to the fact that war
                            often looks as though it offers a short cut but it actually gets you
                            into more trouble. We don’t believe in the efficacy of trying to solve
                            these problems by the idea of cutting the Gordian Knot. I doubt it works
                            these days. We can, as I say, redeem a situation which was pretty far
                            gone last December and certainly we have been fortunate, I think. I
                            don’t know that we have had more than an interim success, and of course,
                            the great credit goes not to the United States but it goes to King
                                <persName corresp="#p_Hussein1">Hussein</persName>. You can’t have a
                            good policy without good people. But this king took a tremendous risk,
                            risk of his own life, and I believe that people like that are to be
                            found in this country and with good sound policies we can gradually
                            develop an Arab sentiment which is more friendly to the West and which
                            is not responsive to the Soviet Union. The latter would be an immediate
                            disaster for Western Europe because we cannot—there is no way in the
                            world in which you can at the present time make Europe comfortably
                            independent of oil in the Middle East and the transit facilities of the
                            Middle East Canal and the pipelines.</p>
                        <p>I would like to say one other thing on this point. We do believe that
                            alternatives to the Suez and the pipelines through Syria should be
                            developed as rapidly as possible. We do not think that the Egyptian <pb
                                n="584" xml:id="pg_584" facs="0612"/>declaration on the Suez Canal

                            think that any document which Egypt would produce would be very
                            dependable. And there is no way that I know of to make the Suez a
                            dependable waterway unless it goes back to the original where it was run
                            by the British and the French. And I think the time is past when it can
                            be done. It was the suggestion of the British that they withdraw from
                            the base, because they couldn’t afford to stay on.</p>

                            80,000. They were beginning at that time to move out. Well, they decided
                            then and I think rightly that you can’t successfully operate that way
                            any more and therefore I don’t think anybody contemplates going back to
                            that status. Therefore, you have got to accept the fact that passage
                            through the Suez is not going to be dependable for the Western European
                            countries, and that there is no form of words which you can devise which
                            is going to make it really dependable. I think it will probably be
                            useful under reasonable conditions at this time to concentrate on
                            developing alternatives. Already it has been demonstrated without Suez
                            and with the pipeline cut off that Europe survived through the efforts
                            of the U.S. shipping more oil. It was costly in terms of oil and terms
                            of dollars. It can be done through perhaps new pipelines, new and bigger
                            tankers going around the Cape, new sources of supplies which can be
                            developed. I think within a few years, the Arab world will be more
                            dependent on Europe as a market than Europe will be dependent on Middle
                            East sources of oil so that the upper hand may have passed away from

                            cooperative ways to help out the general picture. I think if there is

                        <p>One final word on the home situation. We are in the throes of a very
                            strong economy wave on the part of Congress. The House treated the State
                            Department budget very badly and I made a very strong plea before the
                            Senate Committee for the reinstatement of some of the sums that were cut
                                out,<note n="24" xml:id="d249fn24">For text of Secretary <persName

                            Washington. I did not feel that the atmosphere was very friendly—it was
                            friendly to me personally, but not friendly to our increased budget. And
                            if we don’t get some increase, I think we will have to take some cuts.
                            Our needs are increasing; the whole African continent is opening up. If
                            we can’t get additional money for some countries, it will have to come
                            out of some other countries. We are also engaged in planning the mutual
                            security legislation. In fact, we are working very actively on that. As
                            soon as I get back there is a meeting with both leaderships at the White
                            House. The President is planning to send up a message and after that
                            make a radio and television speech to the American public.<note n="25"

                            sledding this year. It is impossible to predict the outcome. But all of
                            us will have to pay particular attention to having a smaller amount of
                            money accomplishing a greater amount of work. It is possible to
                            economize if you spend more time on the problems of economy. The trouble
                            is we have so many more important problems than trying to save a few
                            cents here and there. I told Congress I spent a lot of time striking out
                            unnecessary words in telegrams to cut down, and I don’t know if that is
                            the best way a Secretary of State should spend his time saving money on
                            that. I say it is an expensive way of economizing. But I am afraid we
                            will all have to tighten our belts.</p>

                        <p>A. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>, when he came back to
                            Washington, told me that there were some elements in Britain that
                            weren’t too keen about having Germany reunified, and it makes it a
                            rather dangerous campaign from our standpoint. But I would say we do not
                            favor any plan which takes as its premise the present division of
                            Germany, nor do we favor a plan which particularly would manifest itself
                            by displacing American forces from Germany. The Soviets can go back
                            gradually and we can’t. It is all or nothing with us. For both of those

                        <p>Q. Mr. Secretary, you speak of the possibility of danger of communist
                            domination through Syria and Egypt, of the Middle East area. What form
                            would that take, communist domination of the masses, or of Arab
                            nationalism?</p>
                        <p>A. I think for a considerable time at least the communist character of
                            the movement would have to be masked because I think there is a
                            religious background there which leads the Moslems not to want to be
                            dominated by anything which would show very openly. I will say, however,
                            that the Communists have come out pretty openly in some respects in
                            Syria and I am not sure that we can count only on religion as a
                            safeguard. We must take also in the fact of the Palestinian refugees and
                            Israel. The refugee camps are infiltrated by much Communist
                            propaganda.</p>
                        <p>Q. I merely wanted to comment apropos the Soviet notes. They have made
                            great progress in atomic bomb tests and it is a rather serious
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>A. One thing of interest to you, I might comment on, is the strong
                            concern that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> showed that
                            the British tried to block <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss>
                            at some point, and he feels that at least some elements are trying to do
                            it. Sometimes the British Ambassador in Paris tries to play his hand
                            alone. I said to <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>, and I
                            did say to <persName corresp="#p_MG2">Mollet</persName> when he was in

                            it will be great discouragement on the part of the American people for
                            any future for Europe. Here you have enough people and resources so that
                            they can be a real force in the world. They shouldn’t be intimidated by
                            the Soviet Union if they depend on us for support. We have been
                            bolstering them up for 50 years. Just because they choose to preserve
                            the luxury of independence it keeps them weak. Now hope has been
                            transferred to the Common Market. If that collapses there will be a
                            great feeling against Europe in the United States. And I don’t know what
                            the future would be. I can’t exaggerate the importance in carrying it
                            through—the question of these two treaties.<note n="31"

                        <p>Q. You mentioned, Mr. Secretary, that the countries of Europe are very

                            development and ownership of nuclear strength. Was that discussed in
                            Bonn under the Fourth Country question?</p>
                        <p>A. Yes. There was a certain contradiction I would think, in that they say
                            that unless there is a definite movement to eliminate atomic weapons for
                            everybody they want them too. At the same time, they don’t want these
                            movements on general elimination of nuclear weapons to proceed unless it
                            can be done in a foolproof way and unless it can be done at the same
                            time by a reduction of conventional weapons, which would be extremely
                            difficult to negotiate. They say that the answer is that they want to
                            produce nuclear weapons themselves. I don’t think they are so keen about
                            it, but from a political standpoint they have got to have something to
                            show their people, and the only reason they can show their people they
                            are not going into this game is because it is being called off. From a
                            military standpoint they will be concerned with the prospect of nuclear
                            disarmament. I do think that there is an inconsistency there.</p>
                        <p>Q. Our observation is that as far as the United Kingdom is concerned,
                            anyway, I think the Russians may be in the market for a new
                            letter-writing service. They are not making an impression as far as the
                            government is concerned.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RAG1">Ronhovde</persName>, Netherlands: In
                            connection with the canal, I gather from the statement that you made
                            that the countries have pretty well agreed to accept the situation as it
                            is and try to perhaps work out something over a longer period of
                            time.</p>
                        <p>A. I think so. The situation is this. We were part of the select company,
                            otherwise composed of the Soviet Union and India and Syria, which was
                            given an advance copy of the Egyptian memorandum,<note n="32"
                                xml:id="d249fn32">See <ref target="#d249fn19">footnote 19</ref>
                                above.</note> and we were invited to make comments upon it. We did
                            so and we made perfectly clear that we were not negotiating on behalf of
                            any other country. We did make certain suggestions which we thought
                            might make it more acceptable. At that point the United Kingdom said
                            that they felt with the canal opening up there would be such pressure,
                            economic pressure, to use it that they did not want the talks to be
                            continued any longer but wanted the talks brought to an end. They
                            recommended that whatever we announced be accepted on a de facto,
                            provisional basis. We said to them, do you want to try to organize a
                            boycott of the Canal until you get something better? If you want that,
                            we will go along. They said no. We can’t stand it from an economic
                            standpoint, and we will have to take the best we can get. So, to meet
                            the British position, we just continued our talks in Cairo with the
                            Egyptians to produce this declaration, called the <pb n="589"
                                xml:id="pg_589" facs="0617"/>Council meeting,<note n="33"
                                xml:id="d249fn33">Reference is to the 776th meeting of the <gloss

                                10:30 a.m.</note> said precisely what the British had asked us to
                            say and what we thought the British would also say, that though this was
                            unsatisfactory, inadequate, it would be accepted on a de facto basis.
                            Well, then, after the meeting had been called and we had made our
                            statement, the British, under strong political pressure at home, felt
                            they could not go along, and we were to some extent left exposed as
                            though we were the nation wanting to use the Canal under <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s terms. In the interest of
                            trying to be cooperative and helpful we don’t get many thanks for it.
                            Then the British wanted to try and defer this thing a little bit longer,
                            largely because they were caught on the sterling exchange aspect of this
                            matter. They are afraid sterling is not acceptable. The actual rule is
                            not so important as the prestige factor which is involved, and they were
                            having a meeting yesterday in Basle with representatives of Egypt in an
                            effort to get the Egyptians to accept sterling. I don’t know what
                            happened. Does anyone know what happened?</p>

                        <p>A. (cont.) and they indicated they wanted to get another meeting in the
                            Security Council and rehash this to some extent. But they had this
                            further meeting at which every other country but France said they saw no
                            alternative but accepting these terms, and I think that will mean, of
                            course, that it will be followed.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ZJD1">Zellerbach</persName>, Italy: I
                            would like to come back to this neutral buildup question. On this point,
                            if the United States would withdraw from Germany we would withdraw all
                            the way back to the United States. Is this a point which we can make in
                            our discussions with government people of various countries to which we
                            are accredited? It would be very useful. You know, in Italy right now,
                            there is a development on the part of <persName corresp="#p_GG2"
                                >Gronchi</persName> as against the Foreign Office, which follows our
                            policy right along and <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gronchi</persName> is
                            trying to lead it the other way, and this kind of argument would be very
                            useful to me.</p>
                        <p>A. I think it can be used. One has to be always careful that it doesn’t
                            sound like a threat. It isn’t a threat of course. It is a practical
                            situation. There isn’t room to relocate these people and there is no
                            money—you have the problems of barracks, facilities which are a very
                            expensive operation. You can’t be just doing this every few miles and
                            doing it all over again. There is also the fact—I don’t know if you want
                            to use it or not—that we have very strong elements in the United States
                            who want to get our troops out of Europe and <pb n="590" xml:id="pg_590"
                                facs="0618"/>want to rely only on a deterrent of nuclear weapons. We
                            have the same elements in the United States that prevailed in the United
                            Kingdom. So far, those elements have not prevailed in the United States
                            but they are there. They feel the only way you can bring your defense
                            budget down to reasonable size is to rely wholly upon these nuclear
                            deterrents which you have to pay for anyway and to cut out these armed
                            forces. And I feel very certain of the fact that if any such situation
                            developed and there was dislodging of U.S. forces, they would go right
                            back to the United States. You have got to be careful to expound it and
                            not as I say use as a threat. That is a fact. I made a statement at the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting on U.S. forces there.
                            It was somewhat inaccurately reported to the press. I made it at General
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>’s request and on the
                            President’s authority. The United States position remains the same as I
                            had described it last December.<note n="35" xml:id="d249fn35">For

                            would be no reduction of U.S. forces in Europe. What I said was we had
                            no present plans of reducing our units here. There is some streamlining.
                            We are making an effort to cut down on members of support troops which
                            were not of military value. Also our forces are here under a formula
                            described at the time as a “fair-share” formula.<note n="36"

                                the United States would continue to maintain in Europe “its fair

                            else, who says if the Europeans cut down their contribution we do

                            to say in Holland they could foresee no worse disaster to Western Europe
                            than the withdrawal of forces from Western Germany. Because of that
                                <persName corresp="#p_GHTM1">Gaitskell</persName> and his party are

                            In talking about the budget’s increased emphasis on Africa, we have also

                            wonder if there was any special significance about all this which goes
                            beyond the natural concern about an area which has, perhaps, been
                            neglected in the past and which we are simply trying to get caught up
                            with.</p>
                        <p>A. No, I don’t think anything more than that. There are, of course,
                            European projects which go beyond that such as this thing <pb n="591"

                            members of Common Market being brought in which creates a problem. Some
                            belated adjustment is in prospect of our diplomatic service and foreign
                            aid program toward a continent which is moving forward very rapidly. And
                            we do feel the need for greater effort. You know, the Congress has
                            created the authorization of a new Assistant Secretary of State for
                            Africa, which area will be lifted up in that respect.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJCH1">Bonbright</persName>: Our
                            negotiation on the Azores base has been horribly slow. For once though
                            the ball is on our side of the net, but I hope by the time I get back at
                            the end of the week we will have more instructions on it.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I have a feeling that the people of Portugal would not
                            want to give Goa up to Nehru.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJCH1">Bonbright</persName>: It’s the
                            only weapon they have got and a very nice one. I would be very surprised
                            if they would give it up.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LJD1">Lodge</persName>: Mr. Secretary,
                            there is a growing feeling in Spain that the mutuality of interest is
                            beginning to fade. They think they are doing more for us than we are
                            doing for them. The press is full of propaganda, controlled by the
                            government, comparing the aid received from us with the Marshall Plan
                            aid. They are not acceptable by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>,
                            they are always under attack. They are hoping we would be able to push
                            them in after Congress went into action. They have been trying to do
                            what we asked them to do on the whole. And I believe it is quite vital
                            that we provide the extra $25 million that we have recommended. We are
                            engaged in large build-up on our bases. An additional 12,000 men have
                            been requested which will mean about 25,000 more Americans including
                            dependents. So I would just like to provide the hope that something
                            could be done because I think the Spanish situation which has been going
                            on rather nicely is getting into heavy seas at this point. They have
                            also been scared by the atomic bomb and the new British defense posture
                            has led them to discuss this with me. The question of missile sites in
                            Spain also. They have been neutral in two world wars and they are
                            worried about this without being in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. You probably know all that, Mr. Secretary.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Well, I wish myself we could get them into <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> but we seem to be in considerable
                            difficulty. I wish they would develop better relations with the French.
                            It would help quite a lot. With the French policy in North Africa they
                            figure they have something to trade with, but it doesn’t seem to work
                            very well.</p>

                            (Switzerland) and there is a large question on my mind. Have these

                        <p>The Secretary: Yes. That is in the process. When this thing came up, they

                            The British would like to settle that in October but the final review
                            will be in December.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: But there is a new reevaluation going on. I doubt it will
                            be as searching as some people hope it will be. It is hard to get
                            absolute answers. You just can’t get them. As I was saying to the
                            Chancellor on Saturday,<note n="38" xml:id="d249fn38">See <ref
                                    target="#d249fn23">footnote 23</ref> above.</note> we have had
                            to rely on the deterrent of massive retaliation. We did not have
                            tactical nuclear weapons. The only thing we had was the big bang. Now we
                            have in prospect tactical nuclear weapons. Now those we should not treat
                            as little scratches on the surface, because even tactical nuclear
                            weapons do a lot of damage but it is a totally different effect from an
                            atomic bomb on the centers. You are in an area in which a rather new
                            development is coming up so rapidly that it is not possible to tell in
                            terms of absolutes in any of these matters, and we don’t really
                            encourage the effort to make a very exhaustive view of this subject.
                            Whether or not this British 5,000 man reserve force is going to be
                            located in the continent or in England—I know that <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> is very persistent and very
                            hopeful that it should be located on the continent.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WFE1">Willis</persName>: Have we any
                            information or indication as to whether the Russians are also
                            introducing their army tactical defense weapons?</p>
                        <p>A. Our information is not perhaps very complete and dependable. We are
                            pretty well satisfied that they nearly are as far advanced as we are. In
                            other words, we think they are trying to develop it. They are moving in
                            that direction. I think they have quite a ways to go before catching up
                            with us.</p>
                        <p>I think that is all the time I have this morning.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PGW1">Perkins</persName>: Mr. Secretary,
                            I would like to ask a question a little outside of my area, that is,
                            concerning the Arab refugees in the Middle East. Has any noticeable
                            progress been made toward <pb n="593" xml:id="pg_593" facs="0621"
                            />finding a means of handling this situation? Are there any new thoughts
                            on this problem?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I don’t think any progress has been made in dealing with
                            the refugees. The Arab Governments seem to feel that the only possible
                            solution is to send them back into Israel. They don’t want to see them
                            absorbed into their own land. If they accept them, it would appear that
                            they had renounced their claim that the refugees have a right to go back
                            into Israel. This is not very susceptible of solution at the moment. If
                            the Israelis had stayed in the Gaza Strip, they would have had to take
                            some of the refugees back, and that would have been useful as far as the
                            refugee group was concerned. Now there is no absorption of the refugees
                            by Israel.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Fraser Wilkins</persName>: The Israeli invasion of Egypt
                            foreclosed any possibility of movement of refugees under the Johnston

                        <p>The Secretary: I don’t see any purpose to be served by that. It would be
                            widely interpreted in the Arab world as acceptance of the Soviet
                            position and give the Soviets an aura of respectability which they now
                            lack—the lack of which is one of our principal assets in this area. If
                            we tell the Arabs on the one hand that these people are
                            infidels—atheistic and Godless—and then have dealings with them, we
                            would hurt our main argument. When we were at London for the first Suez

                            Russians on that basis. However, we will <pb n="594" xml:id="pg_594"

                            trying to play it the other way and get the British and French to talk
                            with them and leave us out. The Soviet note to the <gloss

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WJHJ1">Whitney</persName>: In the
                            context of Anglo-American relations, I have had several talks with
                                <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName>. There is
                            tremendous pressure to talk. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1"
                                >Lloyd</persName> has suggested that we could take up the

                            framework. This is a place where I wonder if it could easily be brought
                            up. Was this mentioned at the Bonn Conference?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I think it is being dealt with to some extent between
                            Washington and London at the present time. I noticed no desire on the
                            part of the British to have talks regarding the Russian-Middle East
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Richard Davis</persName>: There are reflections of this in
                            Moscow.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Of course, there are always opportunities to talk
                            informally at the Security Council meetings. I don’t think that would
                            satisfy the Soviets. They want to be publicly accepted as one of the
                            powers which must be taken into account in dealing with the Middle East.
                            By way of background the main part of which you may recall, at the time
                            when Hitler, Stalin and Japan were trying to divide up the world on a
                            tripartite basis, they had pretty well agreed to a division. Who would
                            be dominant in the Middle East was the only stumbling block. The Hitler
                            paper pushed the Soviets further to the East and gave them the Indian
                            Ocean zone, but Stalin insisted on the Persian Gulf area. That was one
                            of the reasons, at least superficially, why the talks failed. Soviet
                            ambitions in the Middle East are well known. At the first meeting of
                            Foreign Ministers in London in 1945 with Secretary Byrnes, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> made clear his demand for a
                            trusteeship of Tripolitania and the Greek Islands. They will not be
                            satisfied just by back-stage talks at the Security Council.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Are there any other questions? I would be glad to answer
                            as well as I can.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary: Well, I don’t think of anything at the moment that would
                            be profitable on that line. It is important to keep alive in our minds a
                            degree of Soviet condemnation in regard to Hungary and East Germany. The
                            Russian rulers are not impervious to open public ostracism. They are
                            extremely anxious to be accepted. The only way to make them give in is
                            if we keep hammering away. An example of this was the Austrian treaty.
                            And in some other aspects they have given into world opinion; for

                            the Soviets first rejected, then accepted it. I hope we’re not going to
                            reject it now that the Soviets have accepted it. Now in the debate
                            concerning aerial inspections, the question is not whether will it take
                            place, but where will it take place.</p>
                        <p>We should not let relations with the Soviets become normalized to the
                            point where we have to draw the veil over things of this sort.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Philip Sprouse</persName>, Belgium: What is the general
                            policy regarding resumption of contacts which were broken off after the
                            Hungarian affair? I have a feeling that the Belgians would be willing to
                            continue these relations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Our policy is not to exclude totally any such relations.
                            We do feel that that relationship, if it is done skillfully, can do much
                            to help advance the development of liberal elements and forces which the
                            leaders would have to bend to. We are making definite progress along
                            that line. You cannot have an industrial state without a good deal of
                            education. You cannot have education without developing inquiring minds.
                            There are reports that among the students in the USSR all sorts of
                            illegal publications are being circulated. How strong the liberal
                            movement is or when it will be effective, no one knows. I believe that
                            to some extent these contacts, exchange of leaders, etc., all help to
                            promote this movement. Therefore, we do not wish to exclude them
                            entirely. We do not want them to achieve such a volume as to imply that
                            we recognize them as moral equals. It is hard to know just where to
                            strike the balance between the two <pb n="596" xml:id="pg_596"
                                facs="0624"/>factors. We are trying to follow an ad hoc basis where
                            no rules are laid down. We have ended the total curtailment which went
                            into force immediately after Hungary and are now on a limited basis. For
                            the satellites other than Hungary, we are doing a little bit more. We
                            hope to work out something on an economic arrangement with the Polish
                            delegation now in Washington.<note n="46" xml:id="d249fn46">Reference is
                                to the agreements signed by the United States and Poland on June 7

                                Poland with $95 million in economic aid.</note> The Poles have shown
                            a degree of independence. As there is a movement toward independence, we
                            respond. However, their independence is not so spectacular as all that;
                            it would take a powerful microscope to see it sometimes. As a general
                            principle, to the extent these countries give evidence of greater
                            independence, we will give them better treatment.</p>

                            prospect of our being able to take more Hungarian refugees?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I find it very hard to be optimistic about that. During
                            the period when public emotion and sympathy was running high the
                            Department of Justice was liberal in regard to the parole system. Now
                            that Congress is back in session and emotions have calmed down, Justice
                            does not find it possible to use this system to the same extent. It is
                            the same with the Jews in Egypt. The committees which are responsible
                            for working this out are not liberal.</p>

                            into the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WFE1">Willis</persName>: There are now

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ECB1">Elbrick</persName>: The Yugoslavs have a
                            similar problem. I don’t see any chance of increasing the number to be
                            admitted to the U.S. by legislation.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ECB1">Elbrick</persName>: This was a last
                            effort during this fiscal year. The Swiss and Yugoslav problems are
                            difficult ones. They are not covered by the parole procedures. They are
                            in third countries. The parole system has not applied to Hungarian
                            refugees other than in Austria.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary: There was no light, just gloom. <persName corresp="#p_MG2"
                                >Mollet</persName> sees no prospect of holding elections. While some
                            local elections might be held, <persName corresp="#p_MG2"
                                >Mollet</persName> is not sure that even these elections would give
                            them a responsible group of leaders. The vision of elections has pretty
                            well <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0625"/>faded into the background.
                            The picture he showed today was one of complete discouragement. The
                            French are trying to organize the country on the basis of local
                            communities and villages. It might be possible to hold some local
                            elections, but there is no possibility of these elections producing any
                            leadership.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ECB1">Elbrick</persName>: Elections for the
                            French Assembly depend on bringing about a cease fire. Right now, there
                            are no real leaders with whom to negotiate to bring about such a cease
                            fire.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: For example, when the French ask the local “leaders” to
                            demonstrate their authority in some way, they would suggest that
                            authority be shown by 24 hours during which time no one is killed.
                            Instead the local “leaders” will kill twice as many people during the 24
                            hours to prove their authority.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>, Germany: I
                            don’t like to plunge you into the morass of Germany again. Russian
                            experts here believe that the Soviet Government will not seriously
                            consider reunification of Germany until after some sort of negotiations
                            between Eastern Germany and the Federal Republic. Are there any
                            conceivable circumstances under which we could recognize the Government
                            of East Germany without the consent of West Germany?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I can see no circumstances which would lead us to
                            recognize East Germany, unless that was desired by the Federal Republic,
                            and it would take a great deal of persuading on the part of the Federal
                            Republic. We don’t recognize the People’s Republics of Vietnam and
                            Korea, and would be extremely reluctant to do so in East Germany. As far
                            as I can now foresee, the future of East Germany is pretty well linked
                            up with the satellite question. Of course, the Soviets might be willing
                            to accept the reunification of Germany if it took place under
                            circumstances which would give Communist elements in East Germany a good
                            chance eventually to take over the whole of Germany. I do not think they
                            will accept any reunification which did not have that as a considerable
                            prospect. Furthermore, I do not think they would accept reunification
                            until they arrive at the conclusion that their entire satellite policy
                            is wrong—that they are willing to be surrounded by countries which have
                            a considerable measure of independence and operate on a friendly basis,
                            such as Finland. The impact of any degree of sovereignty in East Germany
                            would multiply problems in other satellites, particularly Poland.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, I think East Germany is really a part of the entire satellite
                            problem, assuming, of course, that the West Germans are not willing to
                            take reunification on terms whereby the Communists could take over the
                            whole business. The situation in Laos where you also have two provinces,
                            which it was promised would be restored to the Government of Laos and to
                            those controlling the provisions of <pb n="598" xml:id="pg_598"
                                facs="0626"/>the armistice agreement.<note n="48" xml:id="d249fn48"
                                >Reference is to provisions of the Geneva Agreement on Laos of July

                            Communists are not allowing this to happen, unless they can set up
                            conditions which could give them an important place in the central
                            government where they could take it over, such as the Ministry of the
                            Interior, etc. The Government of Laos is not as strong and vigorous as
                            the Federal Republic and is tending to base reunification on those
                            terms. So far they have refused to do so. The situation in Laos is very
                            similar to the political situation in Germany.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WJHJ1">Whitney</persName>: One thing we
                            hear often in England today is that, no matter what happens with respect
                            to the Suez Canal and the regime, the story will really be told when the
                            first Israeli ship does not go through the canal. If it does not go
                            through, could you discuss with us what our possible action would be at
                            that time?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I think it can be assumed with a high degree of
                            probability that no Israeli ship will go through for the time being.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WJHJ1">Whitney</persName>: Will one try
                            to?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: It will try to. I have suggested to them that they not
                            push that issue quickly because we did not want it to arise during the
                            crisis in Jordan. I think that within the next few weeks an Israeli flag
                            ship will try to get through the canal. I don’t think it will get
                            through the canal, and that will raise a very serious problem. The
                            procedure which would be appropriate would be to try to take the matter
                            to the World Court. But, the procedures for getting it to the World
                            Court are not at all clear. The <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UN</gloss>
                            Security Council or the General Assembly could request an advisory
                            opinion from the World Court; but the question would be vetoed by the
                            Soviet Union in the Security Council, and it would be difficult to get a
                            two-thirds vote. I do not think that Egypt will consent to its going
                            there as a contested case. I am not entirely sure that Israel is very
                            keen about its going there. Israel is more concerned about transiting
                            the Straits of Tiran than they are the Canal. Egypt would probably base
                            their refusal on the provisions of the 1888 Treaty, Article 10, which
                            says that the provision in the preceding articles which give the right
                            of transit to all countries would be without prejudice to the right of
                            Egypt to maintain public order. The Egyptian case would be that in the
                            interest of maintaining public order, you cannot have an Israeli ship
                            going through the Canal at the present time, since emotions of the
                            people would run so high on the banks of the Canal that the situation
                            would be entirely uncontrollable. That is a very plausible argument.
                            They do not have to face up to the question of the principle of whether
                            Israel has the right to go through; they can say that in the <pb n="599"
                                xml:id="pg_599" facs="0627"/>interests of maintaining public order,
                            they are delaying or suspending the right of a particular ship to go
                            through. That sounds very plausible.</p>
                        <p>I am not sure that the Israelis would want to take such a case to the
                            World Court because it is not clear what the decision might be. It would
                            depend upon how strong a factual case the Egyptians can develop. I think
                            that we are likely to be confronted for the time being with the
                            likelihood that Israeli ships will not go through the Canal.</p>
                        <p>The question of passage of Israeli cargoes through the Canal is a little
                            different since it is more difficult to prevent passage. I would have
                            said a few days ago that the Egyptians would have let them go through.
                            In view of the Jordan developments, I am not so sure they would. We
                            should remember that the Israelis attach far more importance to access
                            through the Tiran Straits and the Gulf of Aqaba than through the Suez
                            Canal. In the Ben Gurion notes to <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"

                            connection with the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, Ben Gurion
                            specified two points on which the Israeli wanted some sort of
                            satisfaction: one was the right to go through the Straits of Tiran and
                            the other related to the Gaza Strip. He did not mention the rights of
                            Israeli to go through the Suez Canal. That was a rather conspicuous

                            <item>It was evident from the discussions among the Chiefs of Mission
                                present at the Conference that the fundamental bases of the Western
                                Alliance and of the Western community of interest remain firm and
                                sound. Where it is evident that United States policies serve to
                                further the welfare and interests of the Western community as a
                                whole, there is, generally speaking, support and sympathy for those
                                policies. This is particularly true in the case of the smaller
                                countries, such as the Netherlands, who, however, do not hesitate to
                                criticize sharply the manner in which those policies are carried out
                                should they feel inclined to do so. United States policies are
                                inevitably viewed from the perspective of the particular national
                                interests of each country and the reactions of these countries are
                                conditioned to a large extent by their own vital concerns. Austria,
                                for example, while basically in sympathy with United States
                                objectives, is affected by its exposed and vulnerable position and
                                its status of neutrality and thus from time to time is inhibited
                                from espousing openly United States courses of action which might be
                                embarrassing to it. The reactions of Germany, as another example,
                                are conditioned among other things by the great desire for German
                                reunification.</item>

                                have been in conflict with what are regarded to be the vital
                                national interests of individual countries. The policy of the United
                                States in regard to the Suez crisis has left deep and sensitive
                                scars in France and in the United Kingdom. There is widespread
                                dissatisfaction in Western Europe with what is regarded as United
                                States relative inaction in the Hungarian crisis, although no very
                                specific alternatives were suggested by the critics. A certain
                                resentment was reported as existing in a number of countries that
                                the United States treats its friends worse than it treats its
                                enemies. There is some criticism of United States policies in
                                varying degrees in every country of Western Europe depending upon
                                the impact of those policies on specific national interests. Some
                                representatives reported that there was criticism of American
                                foreign economic policy, particularly in connection <pb n="603"

                                of a number of Western European countries concerning United States
                                policies insofar as they appear to be based upon a reliance on the
                                United Nations which many believe to be weighted against their
                                interests. Most of these points of friction are not, however,
                                considered to be acute and appear to be susceptible to amelioration
                                with time, understanding, and patience. It was the consensus of the
                                Conference that many points of friction can be avoided or diminished
                                by a concerted and continued effort on the part of the United States
                                to carry out a policy of prior consultation with its allies,
                                wherever possible or of keeping them informed of the grounds for

                            <item>It was the consensus of the meeting that all countries of Western
                                Europe are now displaying a firm attitude towards Soviet foreign
                                policy. In the case of such countries as Spain and the Netherlands,
                                this firmness has been constant, the Spanish regarding their civil
                                war as a war against the Reds, and the Dutch having been concerned
                                over what they considered to be past British and French softness and
                                fear of possible American softness towards the Soviet Union.
                                Everywhere, firmness has been increased by the impact of the
                                Hungarian revolution. Soviet penetration of the Middle East induced
                                a further stiffening of the British and French attitudes. In Italy,
                                if a <persName corresp="#p_GG2">Gronchi</persName>-dominated
                                government is formed, there may be some relaxation in its strong
                                pro-Western orientation. Neutral Switzerland interprets its
                                neutrality in a manner permitting flourishing relations with West
                                Germany, but no relations with East Germany. Swiss neutrality, which
                                bears no resemblance to neutralism, is combined with a sense of
                                identity with the West.</item>

                            <item>On the question of cultural exchanges with the East, it was
                                pointed out that while the Austrian government was split on the
                                issue of exchanges with the Soviet Union, it favored exchanges with
                                the satellites, particularly with Poland and Yugoslavia. Embassy
                                Vienna is inclined to favor these exchanges with the satellites
                                since the Austrians know the countries and would be unlikely to be
                                impressed by what they saw, as they might be in the Soviet Union.
                                Moreover, it is believed there is a role Austria could play. The
                                French, who cut off cultural exchanges after the Hungarian
                                Revolution, <pb n="604" xml:id="pg_604" facs="0632"/>are resuming
                                them, but on a restricted and controlled basis. They also are
                                interested primarily in encouraging such relations with the
                                satellites, where they feel the historical role of French culture
                                gives them a special advantage. The Dutch, on the other hand, have
                                had very few cultural exchanges, and the Swiss have cut down
                                sharply, largely because individual organizations that are invited
                                to the Soviet Union have simply refused the invitations. It was
                                pointed that the Secretary had indicated that the Department’s
                                policy is to resume a modest program of exchanges with the Soviet
                                Union, but to concentrate largely on the satellites. It is
                                understood, however, that other countries, such as Austria, may be
                                in a different situation. Embassy Moscow warned that the type of
                                exchange favored by the Soviets, spectacular mass exchanges, are of
                                greater advantage to the Soviet Union than to us, since they tend to
                                make people think there is an identity of views between the U.S. and
                                the USSR. On the other hand, smaller, less spectacular exchanges are
                                of benefit to both countries.</item>

                            <item>The Communist parties of Austria, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg,
                                the Netherlands, Portugal and Switzerland were described as small
                                and with virtually no influence. The British Communist Party, while
                                small in itself, has probably infiltrated through trade unions into
                                industry to a greater extent than is generally admitted but the
                                British tend to believe they can control the situation in their own
                                way, without sacrificing civil liberties. While there is limited
                                clandestine Communist activity in Spain, it is probably of little
                                significance, and in general anarchism fits the Spanish temperament
                                better. Italy has the largest Communist Party outside the Iron
                                Curtain. There seems to have been a recent reduction in party
                                strength, however, and there has been a definite weakening of
                                Communist control over the labor movement. The Party remains
                                Stalinist, but less so than the French Party. The French Communist
                                Party is one of the largest and most powerful <gloss target="#t_CP1"
                                    >CP</gloss>s. It has been in gradual decline since the war, but
                                remains important. Hungary represented a serious blow to it, but
                                affected the Party’s fringes more than its central core. It has lost
                                many of the leftist intellectuals who gave it its aura of
                                respectability, but its apparatus has not been affected. It remains
                                thoroughly Stalinist and most loyal to the Soviet Union. Its working
                                class support has been shaken by the Hungarian Revolution, but we
                                can probably expect the Party to recoup by concentration on
                                day-to-day economic issues which affect the French worker much more
                                directly than do events in Hungary.</item>

                                far greater importance—that the momentum be maintained until a
                                political and economic community has been developed in Europe which
                                will enable that area to play the important role in world affairs
                                for which it is so well equipped by its talents and resources. The
                                attainment of this goal depends in large measures upon the British
                                outlook. Without the United Kingdom as an active associate, there

                            <item>The colonial question is a particularly important one. The
                                colonial areas and former colonial areas of Africa and Asia have
                                become a major battle-ground of the cold war. The economy of Europe
                                is heavily dependent on commercial ties with the colonies and former
                                colonies, and colonial problems frequently complicate the relations
                                of the United States with its friends and allies in Western
                                Europe.</item>

                            <item>Major considerations which influence U.S. policy on colonial
                                issues are: a) public opinion in the United States; b) the
                                conclusion or judgment by the U.S. Government that the anti-colonial
                                tide is irresistible; c) concern for the interests and sensitivities
                                of our allies; and d) concern for the strength, well-being and
                                long-range political orientation of the emerging, newly independent
                                states. The recent rapid acceleration in the pace, timing, and
                                schedule of movement toward independence, combined with the tendency
                                to extremism on the part of the new states, has reached a point
                                which we consider sometimes to be dangerous to the interests of our
                                allies and to the future of the emerging states themselves.</item>

                            <item>From the point of view of many of the countries of Western Europe,
                                there was reported to be a widespread feeling that the United States
                                tends to be too moralistic in its attitude toward colonial problems
                                and toward the United Nations. There is anxiety and concern that the
                                United States is inclined to be precipitous in supporting the
                                aspirations for independence of newly emerging states before they
                                are in a position to fulfill all their obligations, that we push too
                                hard and expect too much of the emerging states, and that we are
                                over-ready to accept as full and equal members of the United Nations
                                states which have not yet demonstrated beyond all reasonable doubt
                                their ability to govern themselves and to discharge their
                                international responsibilities.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>In this connection, it was pointed out that several of the Western
                                European colonial powers, such as Belgium and France, as well as the
                                United Kingdom, are making heartening progress in preparing their
                                African territories for eventual self-government and independence. A
                                delicate problem lay in the task of encouraging these powers to stay
                                ahead of the tide of nationalism without appearing in their eyes to
                                be advocating the premature granting of independence to areas not
                                yet ready for it.</item>

                            <item>The recent admission to the United Nations of many newly emerged
                                states as full and equal members has caused disquiet and alarm among
                                many of the nations of Western Europe. This alarm has been
                                intensified by what has appeared to them to be a tendency on the
                                part of the United States, especially in recent months, to
                                subordinate its independence of action in foreign policy to a world
                                organization which we no longer control. To some of the countries of
                                Western Europe, the U.S. has appeared to be abdicating the making of
                                foreign policy to the <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UN</gloss> when we
                                have no firm policy of our own to cover the situation. They are
                                fearful that we may be in the process of losing our freedom of
                                action to an organization which no longer represents Western
                                civilization and in which, in the absence of a system of weighted
                                voting, small and inexperienced nations may decide grave issues the
                                consequences of which they themselves do not have to bear.</item>

                            <item>It was the feeling of the Conference that the United States should
                                faithfully maintain its support of the United Nations. We and other
                                countries should continue to use the United Nations for the
                                settlement of disputes where such a procedure would serve a useful
                                purpose. This reliance on the United Nations should not be
                                exclusive; however, an emphasis should be placed on the
                                possibilities of the use of regional organizations for the
                                settlement of disputes wherever appropriate, a procedure envisaged
                                by the United Nations Charter.</item>

                            <item>In regard to the colonial question, it was the view of the
                                Conference that the United States should not support the creation of
                                independent states until it has become satisfied of their capacity
                                for self-government. Nor should the U.S. support the candidacy for
                                membership in the United Nations of a newly independent state until
                                such a state has demonstrated its ability to fulfill beyond any
                                reasonable doubt the requirements for membership in that
                                organization.</item>

                            as host Ambassador, opened the Conference with a few words of welcome,
                            and then turned the meeting over to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JGL1"

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JGL1">Jones</persName>, speaking on behalf of
                            the participants in the Conference, expressed high satisfaction with the
                            arrangements which had been made and his deep appreciation to Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_WJHJ1">Whitney</persName> and members of his
                            staff. He said that the Secretary regretted being unable to attend the
                            Conference but had sent the following message: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>I regret very much that I am unable to attend your meeting in
                                    London. I have found in the past that Conferences of this type
                                    are very useful, not only to me personally, but also to the
                                    participants and the Department as a whole. I am sure that your
                                    consultations will be fruitful and your meeting successful.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ECB1">Elbrick</persName>, who had taken an
                            active part in the preparations for the Conference, also regretted his
                            inability to be present. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JGL1"
                                >Jones</persName> in reviewing the purposes of the Conference said
                            that it was hoped that it would provide an opportunity for the exchange
                            of ideas on significant developments and trends and for the discussion
                            of the problems common to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            countries. The Conference would provide an opportunity to consider
                            Soviet policy with respect to the countries to which the Chiefs of
                            Mission attending were accredited. He suggested that while two days had
                            been allotted for the Conference, it would be possible to continue, if
                            necessary, on Saturday morning but that it was hoped the Conference
                            could be completed at least by noon on Saturday.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JGL1">Jones</persName> proceeded to outline
                            current United States policies with respect to the Northern European
                            countries, the Soviet Union and the Middle East. He said that the
                            special relationship with the <pb n="610" xml:id="pg_610" facs="0638"
                            />United Kingdom and France growing out of World War II had been based
                            on the assumption that the foreign policy objectives of the three
                            countries were parallel. Within the framework of this tripartite
                            relationship an even closer tie had been developed with the United
                            Kingdom. The United States–United Kingdom relationship is at the core of
                            the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> alliance and is an important
                            element in <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and the Baghdad Pact.
                            Indicative of the attitude of the United States toward this special
                            relationship is the fact that there is no <gloss target="#t_NSC1"

                            consultation was quietly abandoned and replaced by bilateral

                            The United States needs defense facilities in Greenland and this need is

                                corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> on September 18 had made a
                            preliminary presentation to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            Chiefs of Staff at <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss> on the
                            implications of the British troop reductions on the continent and the
                            initial reception of the report had been satisfactory. There appeared
                            some hope of working out adjustments in the original British plans which
                            would be satisfactory to the other Allies. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PGW1">Perkins</persName> said that any acceleration of
                            the German defense program had been impossible before the German
                            elections but that he had been encouraged by Chancellor <persName

                        <p>In the past there had been little political consultation except in the

                            expeditiously with various questions raised during the recent

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PGW1">Perkins</persName> said that for

                            consultation in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. This situation
                            was now changing and he mentioned consultation in <gloss

                                >Perkins</persName> expressed the opinion that the recent United
                            States decision to further reduce its military forces by 100,000 men
                            would cause difficulties in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He
                            said that he was fearful that this United States decision would cause
                            repercussions in Germany endangering the chances of persuading the
                            Germans to accelerate their effort. He was also concerned at the

                            had considerably exaggerated Zhukov’s role and there is some evidence to
                            support this view. He believed that the reports that <persName
                                corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> will replace Voroshilov, who

                            emerged as “much more equal” than the others. He operates through the
                            Party and it is noteworthy that 7 of the 8 Party Secretaries are full
                            members of the Praesidium and the 8th a candidate member.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> must watch his step. It
                            could be argued that he has largely adopted his opponents’ program on
                            foreign relations as indicated by the various developments in foreign
                            affairs since June. Khrushshev’s main interest is in internal politics,
                            particularly the decentralization of industry and the new lands program
                            and on those he is going ahead. He has also packed the Praesidium and
                            Central Committee with his own men and may endeavor to carry this
                            further.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is probably not now in
                            a position to overrule the army on any question that directly affects
                            its interests. He has greatly reduced the power of the police with a
                            corresponding increase in the influence of the army. If any of his
                            policies were to have a dramatic failure he might be eliminated but it
                            is too soon to tell just how he is going to operate.</p>
                        <p>In his three speeches to the intellectuals he turned the clock back and
                            reasserted the role of the Party and it is hard to see how any creative
                            writer can operate in Russia today.</p>

                        <p>In general the changes in leadership have not had a good reception and
                            contemptuous opinions of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> are often expressed, sometimes coupled with
                            favorable remarks about Malenkov. People are concerned about current
                            uncertainties and the danger of guessing wrong about which way the cat
                            will jump. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> seems to
                            have appealed to the provinces against the interests opposing him in
                            Moscow, particularly to party officials and factory managers outside
                            Moscow. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>
                            thought that in the long run Soviet internal policies are the most
                            important both to them and to us and that decentralization carries some
                            element of democracy and could if carried through have a great influence
                            on Soviet foreign policy. From their point of view it is much needed and
                            probably wise if it can be carried out properly. However, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s reliance on the Party
                            which is to a considerable extent a prisoner of ideology is necessarily
                            disturbing.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> thought that
                            the Department’s views as outlined by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JGL1"
                                >Jones</persName> exaggerate the dangers. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has very sensitive antennae
                            and is aware of many of the difficulties of Marxism as indicated by his
                            statement that it goes better with butter. It would be to our advantage
                            if he takes greater account of what the people want. While he is
                            impetuous, he cannot operate alone and if he fails it will be most
                            serious for him. The results of decentralization are being closely
                            watched and the desperate effort to overcome the failure of collective
                            agriculture and the gamble of the new lands program are still uncertain.
                            Production of new lands falls off rapidly after the first year and the
                            big harvest of last year will not be repeated this year. Moreover the
                            Soviet Union is going into a period of reduced labor forces. The law
                            against the parasites is an illustration of this and incidentally
                            strikes at the dissident university groups which have gone the furthest
                            in questioning the Soviet system as indicated at the recent Youth
                                Festival.<note n="13" xml:id="d252fn13">The World Youth Festival,

                        <p>So far as could be judged from Moscow the crisis in the Syrian situation
                            appeared to have been brought on more by the Syrians than the Soviets.
                            He believes that over the long range, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> really wants and is almost forced to a
                            détente in relations with the West. He must find incentives to make up
                            for the manpower drop which requires releasing both resources and
                            personnel. There are therefore many restraints against <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> acting even as a sane
                            dictator, much less as a Stalin. The army would not allow him to build
                            up the police unless the position of the regime was at stake. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> is optimistic in the
                            long range about Soviet seriousness in the disarmament situation.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the students who went to China<note n="15"
                                xml:id="d252fn15">Reference is to the American students who attended
                                the World Youth Festival.</note> he thought that the Chinese had
                            been much cleverer than the Soviets. Moreover the very fact that the
                            Festival was so highly organized by the Soviets had aroused contrary
                            reactions among the students. He thought that our disarmament proposals
                            were too loaded against the Soviets from their point of view to give
                            them a chance to be accepted but he believed that the Soviets would be
                            ready to talk later. He thought that the Soviets had less fear than we
                            have of small countries getting atomic weapons (except West Germany)
                            since they can control their allies better than we.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion he said that their main current objectives are to weaken

                        <p>A ten-minute coffee break then took place.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JGL1">Jones</persName> then asked Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_WJHJ1">Whitney</persName> for a statement on
                            the current political situation in Great Britain.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">United Kingdom</hi></p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WJHJ1">Whitney</persName> said that as a
                            result of the Suez experience, Britain’s position in the world and her
                            relations with the U.S. have been the subject of much discussion. The
                            British are disposed to be more realistic than before about their
                            weakened world position and to cut their coat to fit a relatively
                            smaller piece of cloth, e.g., the new defense policy and the withdrawal
                            of forces from the Continent. At the same time they have a more
                            favorable attitude toward the Continent and European integration, e.g.,
                            the Free Trade Area proposal. The <persName corresp="#p_MH1"
                                >Macmillan</persName> Government has also shown a keen desire to
                            re-establish Anglo-American relations, with good progress to be noted,
                            particularly in the Middle East, despite considerable anti-Americanism
                                <pb n="616" xml:id="pg_616" facs="0644"/>in this country. But the
                            British are sensitive on the subject of consultation and from time to
                            time go out of their way to assert their independence, e.g., China trade
                            controls.</p>
                        <p>In spite of her reduced power Britain is still an important ally, sharing
                            our democratic principles, and still exercises considerable world
                            influence. The <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>
                            Government has been firmer in dealing with the Soviet bloc than
                                <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>. The British have been
                            disappointed with their experiences in the <gloss target="#t_UNO1"
                                >U.N.</gloss> and are anxious to restore the role of the Security
                            Council with its built-in veto to protect the great powers.</p>
                        <p>Britain is having difficulty providing development capital needed for the
                            Commonwealth, which is increasingly becoming an association of
                            under-developed, dark-skinned, new nations. British appreciation of the
                            importance of this relationship is highlighted by <persName
                                corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s decision to visit five
                            Commonwealth countries next January, the first time a British head of
                            government has ever done so while in office.</p>
                        <p>The internal situation is comparatively simple and stable. The
                            Government’s present majority should enable it to prevent a General
                            Election until 1959 or 1960. While <persName corresp="#p_MH1"
                                >Macmillan</persName> has gone far to reunite the Tory Party, he has
                            still not sold himself to the general public and if new elections were
                            held tomorrow the Labor Party would have a larger majority than the
                            Conservatives now have. A Labor Government would present the U.S. with
                            certain problems although many who know <persName corresp="#p_BA1"

                            Secretary he would be much more reasonable than he has been in
                            opposition. The Labor Party is far from united, particularly on such
                            issues as nationalization, the H-bomb and the Soviet bloc.</p>
                        <p>Economic considerations have a decisive effect on British policy and
                            problems both internal and external. Britain must “export or die” and
                            this adds considerably to their determination to release manpower from
                            the armed forces for productive work. The need to economize has become a
                            continually more dominant consideration. Thus when the new defense
                            policy has been carried out their overall strategic reserve will be
                            smaller than the troops now in Cyprus. The problem of inflation is also
                            a growing concern and the Government has so far been unable to control
                            or halt it. This issue may well determine the results of the next
                            General Election.</p>
                        <p>In sum, while Britain is beset by grave economic problems her internal
                            situation is stable. Her foreign policy has been shaken by Suez and her
                            relations with the U.S. are not what they were before, but Britain is
                            moving toward more realistic policies which although <pb n="617"

                        <p>After brief discussion, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JGL1">Jones</persName>
                            asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> for a
                            statement on the current situation in Canada. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> pointed out that Canada
                            constitutes our most important market with about 25 per cent of both
                            imports and exports and that we are in this respect even more important
                            to Canada, having about two-thirds of their imports and exports. Our
                            trade with Canada exceeds that with Western Europe and also that with
                            Latin America. In the post-war diplomacy Canada occupied a unique
                            position as a member of the Commonwealth and a neighbor without a
                            colonial past or geographical pretensions whose influence has been
                            exercised mostly in support of U.S. objectives. Her territory and
                            resources are essential to our military defense.</p>
                        <p>We have major and growing problems with Canada stemming in large part
                            from our economic relations and partly from the recent change in
                                Government.<note n="17" xml:id="d252fn17">In a general election held
                                on June 10, 1957, the Liberal government lost its majority in
                                Parliament, and resigned on June 17; it was succeeded by a
                                Conservative Cabinet with <persName corresp="#p_DJG1">John

                            Conservatives are more nationalistic than the Liberals and more
                            pro-Canadian which can merge into anti-Americanism. They are more
                            protectionist and will try to direct more of the trade and commercial
                            relations, if possible, to the United Kingdom. The diversion of 15 per
                            cent of their trade with us to United Kingdom as mentioned by <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJG1">Diefenbaker</persName>, would however, more than
                            double their trade with Great Britain and is hardly a realistic
                            objective. They will, however, try hard to reduce their dependence on
                            us. They will give us less support in the <gloss target="#t_UNO1"
                                >U.N.</gloss> and will be less articulate and influential. The
                            Conservatives by no means shared the Liberals’ attitude about Suez.
                            While their Cabinet is totally inexperienced in Government, there is a
                            strong civil service and with six to eight months more experience the
                            new individuals in the Government should be on top of their respective
                            jobs and then may well realize the difficulty of their many problems and
                            that the range of choices for solution is limited. If they can avoid
                            committing themselves too far by published statements in the meantime,

                            which is illustrated by <pb n="618" xml:id="pg_618" facs="0646"/>the
                            fact that the hundred million bushel reduction in our wheat surplus in
                            the year ended July 1st was matched by an equal increase in the Canadian
                            wheat surplus. Wheat affects their economy more than ours and this
                            situation has literally hit people where they live since the grain
                            elevators are full and the farmers cannot get paid until the grain is
                            delivered.</p>
                        <p>The next most important problem is the adverse trade balance with the
                            U.S. (almost 1-1/2 billion dollars last year). The Canadian dollar has
                            gone to its highest premium since 1868 because of the huge influx of
                            capital investment funds from American sources which although it has
                            benefited them locally, causes much disquiet because of a feeling that
                            control of their economy is slipping away from them. They complain that
                            they are not allowed the opportunity to buy stock in the Canadian
                            subsidiaries which are set up by American firms and that too many
                            decisions affecting them are taken by the parent companies in

                            10 per cent of its territory. Rather than live under Soviet rule
                            virtually the entire population of the ceded areas (also approximately
                            10 per cent of the national total) moved across the new borders into
                            Finland. As a consequence Finland in the post-war period was burdened
                            with the resettlement of these people at the same time that it was faced
                            with reconstruction of war damaged areas and was having to pay heavy
                            reparations to the Soviet Union. Reparation payments were completed in
                            1952.</p>
                        <p>There are only 30 to 40,000 hard core communists in the country, but
                            nevertheless the communist controlled <gloss target="#t_SKDL1"
                                >SKDL</gloss> Party polled nearly 20 per cent of the total vote in
                            the last elections. In the immediate post-war years the Finns moved
                            cautiously in dealing with the communists, but in 1948 they ousted the
                            last communist member of the Government.</p>
                        <p>There are six parties represented in Parliament and none of them has a
                            majority. As a consequence Finland has had a series of coalition
                            governments including usually the two largest parties, the Social
                            Democrats and the Agrarians. Governments are generally weak and this
                            fact, along with the effects of war and the burden of reparations,
                            explains the economic difficulties which Finland has been experiencing.
                            The Finn mark was devaluated by 39% this week in an effort to <pb
                                n="620" xml:id="pg_620" facs="0648"/>ease the country’s financial
                            crisis. This action was preceded by a price freeze and the imposition of
                            an export tax. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJ1"
                                >Hickerson</persName> said that while Finland has serious economic
                            problems these problems can be solved. The next twelve months, however,
                            will be difficult.</p>
                        <p>With respect to foreign affairs Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJ1"
                                >Hickerson</persName> said that the biggest influence in Finnish
                            foreign policy is the fact that Finland has a 700-mile frontier with the
                            Soviet Union. He expressed the opinion that the Russians will respect
                            Finnish independence to the extent of refraining from using physical
                            forces. Finland for its part is bound by the non-aggression pact not to
                            permit its territory to be used as a base for an attack on the Soviet
                            Union. Finland, therefore, pursues a policy of neutrality and avoids
                            involvement in disputes between the great powers. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_HJ1">Hickerson</persName> said that the Soviets rather
                            than using force would attempt to seduce the Finns. This effort would
                            take at least two generations and by that time the character of the
                            Soviet Union itself might well have changed. At the present time, the
                            Finns regard the Russian people rather than Communism as the real
                            menace.</p>
                        <p>Finnish armed forces are severely limited by the peace treaty.<note
                                n="21" xml:id="d252fn21">Reference is to the Treaty of Peace with

                            reasons Finland would like to have these limitations lifted. It is
                            probable that it will raise the questions eventually, even though at the
                            moment economic circumstances preclude an expansion of the army.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJ1">Hickerson</persName> said that one
                            of the most serious developments in Finland has been the split in the
                            Social Democratic party, a split that initially involved personalities
                            rather than fundamental principles. It is essential that the Social
                            Democrats get together, but so far there is no evident that the
                            communists have gained voting strength as a result of the split.</p>
                        <p>Communist propaganda is active and is carried on through a Helsinki
                            newspaper with a circulation of 50,000 and in a half dozen smaller
                            papers in other cities. The Soviets also arrange and largely finance a
                            very extensive exchange of persons.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MJJ1">Muccio</persName> stressed the
                            importance of Iceland from a military strategic point of view to the
                            United States Air Force and to <gloss target="#t_SACLANT1"
                                >SACLANT</gloss>. The Soviet Union also recognizes the importance of
                            Iceland to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense and has made a
                            sustained effort to split Iceland from its <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> partners.</p>
                        <pb n="621" xml:id="pg_621" facs="0649"/>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MJJ1">Muccio</persName> said that the
                            United States has three basic objectives with respect to Iceland: 1) to
                            maintain United States forces and facilities in the country, … and 3) to
                            reduce Soviet economic and political influences. The Ambassador reviewed
                            developments since the break up of the Independent-Progressive
                            Government in March 1956 leading up to the national elections of June
                            and the request for withdrawal of United States forces. The United
                            States-Icelandic negotiations of last November resulted in the
                            withdrawal of this request. He said that the United States position in
                            Iceland is better today than before the crisis. Four-fifths of the
                            population is on the side of the West and hard core communists have
                            dropped in the last year from 1,000 to approximately 500–600. The
                            communists have also suffered some losses in the labor movement.</p>
                        <p>Iceland was the first <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> country to
                            admit communists to government. At first we felt that we could not deal
                            with such a Government. This policy was later altered. … The communist
                            influence in Iceland is based on their control of the Icelandic
                            Federation of Labor which they took over in 1954. Furthermore they have
                            complete control, and have had for twenty years, of the largest union in
                            Iceland, the non-skilled. During the past years there has been less
                            friction among the three democratic unions which has resulted in an
                            improvement in the position of the democratic trade unionist vis-à-vis
                            the communists.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MJJ1">Muccio</persName> said that the
                            United States should take a firm but understanding position toward
                            Iceland. It was the Icelandic Government which took the initiative of
                            raising in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> the question of trade
                            with the Soviet bloc. The Democratic ministers in the government have
                            proved in the past year that they can control the communists in
                            government on security and foreign policy matters.</p>
                        <p>In the discussion which followed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MJJ1"
                                >Muccio</persName>’s remarks, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PGW1"
                                >Perkins</persName> said that there was a fair chance of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries giving assistance to
                            Iceland, particularly if the United States were to do so. He also
                            mentioned the possibility of Germany alone providing the required
                            assistance. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MJJ1">Muccio</persName>
                            said that an assurance that the West would help if the Russians abruptly
                            cut off taking Icelandic fish would be of great value to Iceland.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Norway</hi></p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WFE1">Willis</persName> stressed the
                            strategic importance of Norway with its numerous protected harbors and
                            its airfields close to the Soviet Union. Furthermore there is a close
                            relationship between the security of North America and Norway since a
                            Soviet air attack by the shortest route would pass over Norwegian
                            territory. Norway thus takes on importance as a part of the early
                            warning system. Finally <pb n="622" xml:id="pg_622" facs="0650"/>Norway,
                            though a small country from the point of view of population,
                            nevertheless has the third largest merchant marine in the world.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WFE1">Willis</persName> said that it is
                            important to remember that Norway as an independent country dates only
                            from 1905. As a consequence it retains the strong feeling of nationalism
                            characteristic of young countries. We must be careful in our relations
                            with Norway to respect these sensitivities, remembering that this
                            nationalism stiffens the Norwegians in resisting Soviet pressures.
                            Nationalism was one factor in the Norwegian decision not to permit the
                            establishment of foreign bases or the stationing of foreign armed forces
                            on her territory except in the event Norway was attacked or an attack
                            was imminent. In addition to this factor there is a strong Norwegian
                            pacifist-neutralist tradition. The experiences of World War II dislodged
                            the country from its neutralism and caused Norway to accept membership
                            in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Nevertheless neutralism and
                            pacifism remain latent in the country. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_WFE1">Willis</persName> said that approximately 20% of
                            the membership of the Labor Party is tinged with pacifist views. This
                            explains in part the strong support in Norway for disarmament. There is
                            also real concern about the danger of atomic fall out. It is also worth
                            noting that the Labor movement in Norway was originally strongly leftist
                            and many of the early leaders were communists, but having been
                            disillusioned are staunchly anti-communist. The Norwegian Labor Party is
                            now probably farther to the right than the British Labor Party. It is
                            not doctrinaire and advocates no further nationalization. It believes
                            rather in planned economy and the welfare state.</p>
                        <p>Norway is bound to the West by strong traditional ties enhanced by its
                            position as a trading nation. Furthermore the emigration of many
                            Norwegians in the past to the United States has strengthened these ties.
                            At the same time the geographic proximity of Norway to the Soviet Union
                            obliges Norway to seek to maintain as good relations as possible with
                            the Soviet Government. The Soviet Union regards Norway as a key country
                            and has employed blandishments and threats in an effort to separate
                            Norway from its <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners.</p>
                        <p>Norwegian foreign policy is based on strong support for the <gloss
                                target="#t_UNO1">UN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. Most Norwegians recognize the necessity of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> membership, but they are
                            unenthusiastic about defense expenditures. With a weaker government it
                            might be difficult to maintain the current level of expenditures on
                            defense in competition with the demands of the welfare state. The
                            Defence Committee of Parliament supports the idea that defense should
                            continue to receive a constant share of the increasing <gloss
                                target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>, but the full Storting has not
                            indicated its accord. Norway must continue to look to the United States
                            for military assistance if she is to maintain modern armed forces.</p>
                        <pb n="623" xml:id="pg_623" facs="0651"/>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WFE1">Willis</persName> pointed out that
                            Norway is a small country with a population of only 3 1/2 million and a
                            gross national product of $4.1 billion. To judge by election results
                            since 1935 Norway prefers a mild form of Socialism to outright
                            Capitalism. In spite of the differences in political philosophies and
                            our relative strength if we exercise wise leadership in the <gloss

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> stated that the

                            education and by their own efforts have made themselves reasonably
                            prosperous. They have learned the uses of patience in their foreign
                            relations. In view of the strong trait of neutralism after the
                            Napoleonic Wars it was an important step for them to join <gloss

                            in the radical Liberal party. All but the Communists are pro-Western and
                            sympathetic to the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Danish defense expenditures will be about the same next year as last but

                            their expenditures. In spite of the many parties there is an underlying

                            country without ambition the Danes are relaxed and objective in their
                            world views and could well serve as a sort of conscience for us, being
                            as democratic as we are. The Arkansas situation has caused much

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Clark</persName> said that there is a trend in Congress to

                            countries considered friendly toward the United States. The severe

                            countries will remain friendly if we do nothing about it. He expressed
                            the strong conviction that the activities now performed by <gloss

                            which followed, it was the consensus that there is a continuing need for

                            countries, which include all of Northern Europe. It was agreed that
                                <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> is an essential and integral
                            part of the official representation of the United States abroad and that
                            these operations have been fully integrated into the respective
                            Embassies. It was agreed that the recent budget cuts affecting the

                            had been serious. Fear was expressed that any further reductions would
                            result in cutbacks beyond the minimum level considered necessary, and
                            would mean that the regular Embassy staffs would be forced to assume
                            certain responsibilities in the press and cultural fields which normally
                            should be discharged by <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>. This

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> emphasized the
                            need to increase the number of hours of English-language broadcasting to
                            the USSR, pointing out that these programs would have a major influence
                            on very important target groups. He also outlined the need for
                            informational material for distribution to selected members of the
                            Diplomatic Corps, particularly Asian and Middle East, who are cut off
                            from access to almost all Western materials while in Moscow.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MLRWS1">McLeod</persName> emphasized the
                            need to have at least one cultural or Public Affairs Officer assigned to
                            Dublin to meet the essential needs of his mission.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> cited the
                            special circumstances in Canada which make it undesirable to have an
                            information program.</p>
                        <p>After a discussion of exchanges with the Soviet Union and the Satellites,
                            it was agreed that it would be most helpful to the Chiefs of Mission to
                            have a policy statement from the Department on East-West exchanges,
                            since Foreign Governments were constantly asking about our position in
                            this respect.</p>
                        <p>There was unanimous agreement on the value of the U.S. Exchange of
                            Persons programs in the various countries. Certain Fulbright programs
                            were drawing to an end and it was recommended that ways and means be
                            explored to continue these essential programs either through
                            appropriated funds or through sales of surplus commodities on which the
                            foreign currencies would be earmarked for exchange financing.</p>

                            Sea</hi></p>
                        <p>At the request of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JGL1">Jones</persName>, Mr.
                                <persName>Sanders</persName> then gave an outline of the situation
                            with respect to the forthcoming conference on the Law of the Sea in
                            Geneva on February 24, 1958. Mr. <persName>Sanders</persName> explained
                            that the policy decisions upon which instruction would be based had not
                            yet received final clearance although the U.S. position in most respects
                            has been fairly well established. He went on to say that 89 countries
                            had been invited to the conference which was being held under a <gloss
                                target="#t_UNO1">U.N.</gloss> General Assembly resolution which was
                            sponsored by the U.S. and 22 other countries. In addition to certain
                            broad political considerations, our motive in sponsoring the conference
                            was to get <pb n="628" xml:id="pg_628" facs="0656"/>the discussions out
                            of the political forum and before a properly equipped scientific and
                            technical meetings.</p>
                        <p>The conference will consider a report prepared by the International Law
                            Commission covering the law of the sea in time of peace and containing
                            73 articles. It will involve not only legal considerations but
                            biological, scientific, technical and political elements.</p>
                        <p>The principal fields to be covered are the Continental Shelf,
                            International Fishing Rights and the Problems of the High Seas and the
                            Territorial Waters.</p>
                        <p>As to the Continental Shelf, it will be necessary to define the submarine
                            areas covered by it and to define what constitutes a natural resource of
                            the shelf. For example, we are in conflict with Mexico which claims
                            shrimps as a natural resource while we have maintained that natural
                            resources must be permanently attached to the shelf.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the High Seas, we may anticipate difficulty with the
                            Soviets on the subject of privacy based on the activities of the Chinese
                            Nationalists’ Government blockading Chinese Communist ports. It also
                            involves the question of pollution from radio-active waste and the use
                            of large areas of the High Seas for weapons experiments.</p>
                        <p>The question of International Fishing Rights is linked to Territorial
                            Waters. A small extremist group, including Chile, Peru and Ecuador which
                            do not possess a continental shelf claim a zone two hundred miles in
                            width. This group bases its claim principally on alleged concern for the
                            conservation of the resources of the sea. On the other hand, Argentina
                            claims the waters above the shelf, which extends five hundred miles to
                            sea. In general the moderate group is moved by economic considerations
                            and demands special or exclusive to stand on the three mile limit
                            without contiguous zones for fisheries. The U.S. supports in general the
                            articles proposed by the <gloss target="#t_ILC1">ILC</gloss> on fishing
                            and conservation which give the coastal state certain qualifying rights
                            which enable it to take unilateral action for conservation purposes when
                            there is a failure to agree with other states but then only on basis of
                            scientific and technical evidence and of a prior agreement to arbitrate
                            disputes as to the facts. It is anticipated that the U.S. will submit
                            certain additions to the <gloss target="#t_ILC1">ILC</gloss> articles
                            concerning the principle of abstention and the arbitral procedure. While
                            the Commission’s proposals represent a concession to the claims of the
                            coastal states, they would be unacceptable to the extremists and do
                            nothing to meet the claims of the moderates based on economic
                            considerations. The principal dangers to the U.S. position would come at
                            the conference from a joining of forces between the extremists and the
                            moderates in terms of a modest extension of the territorial sea with the
                            recognition of broad contiguous zones for fisheries or conservation. The
                            traditional position of the U.S. on this question is being reviewed in
                            the <pb n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0657"/>light of this possibility.
                            However no decision has been reached. It has been suggested that
                            discreet inquiries be undertaken to ascertain the acceptability by
                            enough states to ensure majority support of a formula which would
                            maintain the territorial sea at three miles but recognize six, nine or
                            twelve miles of contiguous zones for fisheries. Should this suggestion
                            be approved the inquiry would be made on a highly selective basis. Every
                            effort would need to be made to avoid giving the impression that the
                            U.S. is contemplating a change in its traditional position.</p>
                        <p>In the ensuing discussion Mr. <persName>Sanders</persName> pointed out
                            that our insistence on the three mile limit is based in large part on
                            security considerations. A look at the basic difference between U.S. and
                            U.S.S.R. naval power gave the key to the issues at stake. The U.S.
                            wishes the maximum area of operation for its carrier-based aircraft. An
                            extension of the three mile limit will diminish this area, and at the
                            same time increase the area in which Soviet submarines could operate. It
                            was also pointed out that an extension of the three mile limit would
                            convert certain waters, such as the Aegean Sea, into virtually enclosed
                            lakes. There were a number of such considerations and these would be
                            developed in the instructions to the field now being prepared.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Sanders</persName> pointed out that as a very rough
                            estimate it appeared that only 18 out of 89 countries could be counted
                            on to stand firm on the three mile limit and there was even some
                            variation of attitude among them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BW1">Barbour</persName> pointed out that any
                            extension of the three mile limit would undoubtedly reopen the
                            difficulties with respect to British trawlers fishing in Icelandic
                            waters.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Sanders</persName> expressed the hope that the conference
                            would agree to confine itself to seeking multilateral agreement on basic
                            principles and rules and would exclude the airing of bilateral
                            controversies, including such matters as the Gulf of Aqaba.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Sanders</persName> concluded by pointing out that is is
                            basic to out position that conservation can be achieved only by
                            international cooperation and not by unilateral action. The reasons for
                            our position on this and other issues have a complex scientific and
                            technical basis and it is therefore important to get the full statement
                            of our views with supporting data circulated among the particular
                            countries without delay.</p>

                        <p>At the moment legislation to replace the expiring Trade Agreements

                                of 1951.</note> is under consideration in the Committee. In this
                            connection Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> mentioned
                            the strong resurgence of protectionist sentiment in the United States.
                            The rapid industrialization of the South has meant an increase of
                            protectionism in an area which traditionally has supported liberal trade
                            policies. The Administration has not abandoned the effort to obtain
                            ratification of the <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss>, notwithstanding
                            the difficulties experienced in the last session of Congress.</p>
                        <p>In discussing the Mutual Security Act Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1"
                                >Randall</persName> stressed the importance of approval for the
                            first time by Congress of an aid appropriation which does not have to be
                            committed during the year for which it has been appropriated. The $300
                            million Development Fund appropriation for fiscal year 1958 need not be
                            re-appropriated if not committed this fiscal year. The Congress also
                            authorized $625 million for fiscal years 1959 and 1960. It is difficult
                            to forecast how the Development Fund will be administered and its
                            relation with the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and the Eximbank
                            are still to be worked out. Loans by the Development Fund may be made to
                            countries which are not members of the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1"
                                >IBRD</gloss>. The loans of the Fund will not be subject to the Buy
                            American restrictions which apply to Eximbank loans.</p>
                        <p>The Mutual Security Act further provides $200 million for emergencies
                            which gives the aids program additional flexibility. While the Battle

                                Assistance Control Act of 1951, commonly called the Battle Act after
                                Representative Laurie C. Battle of Alabama. The act established
                                controls on strategic trade and stipulated that U.S. aid would be

                            securing a transfer of defense support costs to the defense budget as
                            recommended by the Fairless Committee.<note n="31" xml:id="d252fn31"

                            Policy will consider the question of a further extension of <gloss

                            misleading. Granting loans to foreign nations presented problems of
                            selection and as a consequence we have in the past given funds to
                            Governments which have then determined the recipients.</p>
                        <p>The Committee on Foreign Economic Policy has been studying the problems
                            presented by Soviet economic penetration in the underdeveloped
                            countries. The Committee meets every three months in a session devoted
                            exclusively to this subject. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1"
                                >Randall</persName> said that so far the American business community
                            is not generally aware of the danger to our future markets which Soviet
                            technicians and the trade promotion in which they are engaging
                            constitute.</p>
                        <p>In the discussion which followed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1"
                                >Randall</persName>’s remarks it was suggested that a greater effort
                            should be made to explain to the American public the need for foreign
                            aid. This suggestion was prompted by evidence of growing opposition to
                            foreign aid, based on a lack of understanding of the objectives and
                            purposes which it serves.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> mentioned the
                            suggestion made in Austria that the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                                >OEEC</gloss> be employed for provision of aid to Poland and to the
                            under-developed countries. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TLE1"
                                >Thompson</persName> said that this suggestion appeared to have
                            merit. The Soviet Union has an advantage over the United States in being
                            able to supply a market for the products of these countries. Through the
                                <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> markets might be supplied to a
                            country such as Poland thus counterbalancing this Soviet advantage. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> said that this
                            question was not under current study but he mentioned United States
                            objections to the provision of aid through multilateral channels.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PGW1">Perkins</persName> commented that
                            there were many cases where our objectives can be better served by
                            employment of a multilateral method.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WWNJ1">Walmsley</persName> opened his
                            discussion of national attitudes toward the <gloss target="#t_UNO1"
                                >U.N.</gloss> and the U.S. role therein by exhibiting a number of
                            slides graphically representing the voting in the <gloss

                            issue, French Togoland, Middle Eastern cease fire and withdrawal, the
                            resolution deploring Israeli non-compliance, the stationing of <gloss

                            Soviet complaint against alleged U.S. intervention in Eastern
                            Europe.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WWNJ1">Walmsley</persName> discussed the voting
                            pattern indicated by the slides and pointed out the variations in
                            them.</p>
                        <p>He then noted certain additional questions confronting the <gloss
                                target="#t_UNO1">U.N.</gloss> General Assembly in the 12th session
                            including the question whether the French can terminate their
                            trusteeship of the Togoland and the refusal of Portugal and Spain to
                            respond to the request for reports on their colonies. He went on to say
                            that elections will take place for three new members of the Security
                            Council, one European, one Latin American, one formerly “Eastern
                            European” which it is now hoped will be Japanese. He pointed out that
                            the disarmament item will also come up; it is hoped this year to obtain
                            a 2/3 endorsement of the Western proposals. Other items are the question
                            of Palestinian refugees and the repayment of advances for the clearance
                            of the Suez Canal. The latter item is complicated by the British and
                            French claim for work done before their withdrawal. It was noted that
                            progress is being made toward a compromise proposal for the solution of
                            this problem which is now before the Secretary General whereby their

                        <p>He stated that British representative on <gloss target="#t_ILO1"
                                >I.L.O.</gloss> is about to retire and that the hope has been
                            expressed that it would be possible for the U.S. to arrange Government
                            representation on <gloss target="#t_ILO1">I.L.O.</gloss> which will be
                            both at a high level and give assurance of continuity, and it is hoped
                            that the Department is giving consideration to this.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WWNJ1">Walmsley</persName> drew attention to
                            public opinion polls taken last winter, which indicated a high degree of
                            support in the U.S. generally, and also among college students, for the
                                <gloss target="#t_UNO1">U.N.</gloss> He pointed out that the only
                            serious cut in appropriations by Congress for <gloss target="#t_UNO1"
                                >U.N.</gloss> purposes had resulted indirectly from the 40% cut in
                            appropriations for international <pb n="633" xml:id="pg_633" facs="0661"
                            />contingencies. On the other hand the Congress permitted us to phase
                            the scaling down of our contribution ceilings to <gloss target="#t_UNO1"
                                >U.N.</gloss> agencies to the statutory level of 33-1/3%.</p>
                        <p>He said the membership of the <gloss target="#t_UNO1">U.N.</gloss> is now
                            82. The most serious result of this is that the Asians and Africans,
                            with 35-1/3% of the membership of the General Assembly, now have a veto
                            on all substantive resolutions. The Africans and Asians plus any 14
                            Latin Americans can muster a clear majority. The Africans and Asians,
                            together with all the Latin Americans and the Soviet bloc, can adopt any
                            substantive resolution by 2/3 majority.</p>
                        <p>He concluded by pointing out that despite the many overwhelming votes
                            against the Soviet bloc, the Soviet Union shows no signs of withdrawing
                            from the <gloss target="#t_UNO1">U.N.</gloss> and in fact they and their
                            satellites are increasing their participation in the specialized
                            agencies. However distasteful the new voting pattern may be, we must
                            recognize that events have forced us to attempt to do things in the
                            General Assembly that the Charter did not originally contemplate, and
                            that we will have to live with the <gloss target="#t_UNO1">U.N.</gloss>
                            which is here to stay.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> pointed out that our
                            veto power has now gone or is at best unreliable. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BW1">Barbour</persName> pointed out that the British
                            feel that in a showdown the U.S., out of its desire to placate the
                            Asians and Africans, cannot be counted upon.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JGL1">Jones</persName> expressed the belief
                            that, with the exception of the <gloss target="#t_UKG1">U.K.</gloss>,
                            the U.S. has few outstanding political problems involving the <gloss

                            It was noted that the question of Chinese representation is an exception
                            to this general situation.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WFE1">Willis</persName> pointed out that
                            it is damaging to the prestige of the U.S. to seek to change the
                            established position of countries such as those of Scandinavia in the
                            hope of obtaining majorities on all issues before the <gloss
                                target="#t_UNO1">U.N.</gloss> It was suggested that less emphasis
                            should be placed on getting majorities for their own sake, that we
                            sometimes show too much fear of being out-voted and that it is damaging
                            to our interests to seek to change the vote of a country which has an
                            established position which we know it will not change.</p>
                        <p>It was brought out that an effort should be made to get information to
                            American Missions about the performance of delegates to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UNO1">U.N.</gloss> General Assembly from the countries to
                            which they are accredited. It would be preferable if such information
                            could be received as currently as possible while the General Assembly is
                            in session but would be useful even at the end of a session.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WFE1">Willis</persName> pointed out the
                            importance of receiving from the Department adequate material to enable
                            our Missions to present <pb n="634" xml:id="pg_634" facs="0662"/>and
                            explain in simple terms our position on disarmament, since the Soviet

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TBELIII1">Timmons</persName> summarized the
                            current situation with respect to European integration and the national
                            attitudes of interested countries with respect to it. He pointed out
                            that a 10-year cycle has now been completed since the beginning of the
                            work of the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> toward trade
                            liberalization and the multilateralization of credits. During this
                            period the feeling developed among the six countries of <gloss

                            that cooperation between governments is not enough and has resulted in
                            establishment of the Coal and Steel Community and the treaties soon to

                            the Common Market. These have the effect of associating Germany with the
                            West on a basis of equality. He pointed out that the Six are, in a
                            sense, ambivalent toward the British whose motives they have suspected
                            but whom they also wish to have in the closest possible participation. A
                            revolutionary change, however, has taken place in British thinking, as
                            indicated by the <gloss target="#t_FTA1">FTA</gloss> proposals of July
                            1956, even though the British cannot accept supranational institutions
                            and wish to exclude agriculture from the <gloss target="#t_FTA1"
                                >FTA</gloss> and protect their trade with the Commonwealth.</p>
                        <p>The United States favors the development of the Six and the integration
                            of Germany by organic ties to the West in such fashion to prevent the
                            revival of the French-German conflict. We aspect to give all appropriate
                            support to the communities of the Six, which we regard as the key to the
                            developing unity of Europe. He stressed the deep personal interest of
                            the President and the Secretary of State in these developments.</p>
                        <p>In spite of rumors to the contrary, we also strongly support the <gloss
                                target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> which is a framework and a
                            transmission belt for associating the Six with the other <gloss
                                target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> countries of Western Europe.</p>
                        <p>He summarized the present situation with respect to ratification and
                            noted that the treaties are likely to go into force on January 1, 1958.
                            There may be a meeting of Ministers of the Six toward the end of this
                            year to decide on the location of the various bodies of <gloss
                                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> and the Common Market and the
                            personnel which will make up their commissions. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWW1">Butterworth</persName> thinks that the resignation
                            of Mayer as Chairman of the High Authority of the Coal and Steel
                            Community may well mean that a German will succeed to this post with a
                            Frenchman as Chairman of <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> and
                            a national of one of the <gloss target="#t_Benelux1">Benelux</gloss>
                            countries as Chairman of the Common Market.</p>
                        <p>The United States would like to see the executive agencies of the three
                            communities of the Six located in one place, such as Luxembourg. There
                            is opposition, from the Germans and others, to their <pb n="635"
                                xml:id="pg_635" facs="0663"/>being in Paris. It seems likely,
                            however, that at least one of the communities may be set up in a
                            separate location, such as Brussels.</p>
                        <p>The Common Market will constitute a real customs union with the complete
                            elimination of internal trade barriers (except for agriculture), a
                            common external tariff, and a common commercial policy toward the
                            outside would, as well as harmonized social charges to be established by
                            the end of the “transition period”, which is 12 to 15 years. There are
                            also provisions that will, by European standards, go quite far for the
                            elimination of restraints on trade. Goods from overseas territories will
                            move freely into the Common Market but not, as matters now stand, to the
                            Free Trade Area.</p>
                        <p>While <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> and the Common Market
                            authorities have less supranational powers than the Coal and Steel
                            Community they nevertheless represent important progress. Their
                            assemblies lack general legislative power but will have the power to
                            censure officials of the executive bodies and force their
                            resignation.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the Free Trade Area, it was pointed out that the British
                            wish agriculture to be excluded while the Six wish it included, but that
                            there seems to be room for eventual compromise. Another difficult
                            problem will be the “definition of origin” of goods, with problems
                            arising out of the French high tariffs on raw materials, the general
                            British absence of tariffs on raw materials and the fact that such
                            countries as the Netherlands have agreed to forego the advantages they
                            would derive from their present low tariffs on raw materials by moving
                            to a common external tariff. Another problem is the problem of how to
                            associate the less-developed countries (Greece, etc.) with the Free
                            Trade Area.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TBELIII1">Timmons</persName> said
                            that our attitude toward the Free Trade Area was similar to that toward
                            the Common Market and <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>. We
                            are optimistic that these developments will result in a stronger Europe,
                            politically and economically, and hope that they will result in no
                            increase and even a decrease in protectionism.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BW1">Barbour</persName> commented that Embassy
                            London is now convinced that Britain is behind the Free Trade Area and
                            prepared to give it leadership and is acting in good faith. Divisions
                            that existed in the British Government initially now seem to be
                            overcome. While the problems of agriculture and trade with the
                            Commonwealth still remain, there are hints of growing flexibility.</p>
                        <p>A discussion then took place of a proposal for a Nordic Common Market and
                            it was the consensus that the Scandinavian countries preferred to
                            organize a Nordic Common Market first before considering their entry
                            into the Free Trade Area.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> pointed out
                            that the new Canadian Government is much more cool toward these
                            developments than its predecessor and would regard British entry into a
                            Free Trade Area with <pb n="636" xml:id="pg_636" facs="0664"/>alarm and
                            disappointment if this trend were to go farther, but would probably
                            accept the situation if agriculture is excluded.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PGW1">Perkins</persName> pointed out
                            that Turkey, Greece, Portugal, Iceland and Denmark do not see how they
                            will be able to participate in the Free Trade Area, at least without
                            assistance. But if the Free Trade Area should be set up with four or
                            five countries around the Common Market joining it, and the
                            above-mentioned countries not joining it, the result might well be to
                            wreck the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JGL1">Jones</persName> then announced that the
                            substantive work of the conference had concluded and that a further
                            short meeting would be held the next morning to consider the conclusions
                            and recommendations.</p>
                        <p>At the following day’s meeting, after agreeing to the conclusion and

                                >Peterson</persName>, expressed their appreciation to Ambassador and

                            for their work in preparing the record of the conference.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that the Conference had been most valuable and that it
                            would be in the interest both of the participating Mission and the
                            Department to hold such conferences once a year.</p>

                                areas has brought it into sharp conflict with the United Kingdom in
                                many parts of the world, thus making it difficult for the Soviet
                                leaders to succeed in their former policy of courting the United
                                Kingdom in an effort to separate it from the U.S.</item>
