                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The series
                    documents the facts and events that contributed to the formulation of policies
                    and includes evidence of supporting and alternative views to the policy
                    positions ultimately adopted.</p>
                <p>The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for
                    the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The
                    staff of the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans,
                    researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. This documentary
                    editing proceeds in full accord with the generally accepted standards of
                    historical scholarship. Official regulations codifying specific standards for
                    the selection and editing of documents for the series were first promulgated by
                    Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925. These regulations, with
                    minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by
                    Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992
                    and 1993, which was signed by President <persName>George Bush</persName> on
                    October 28, 1991. Section 198 of P.L. 102–138 added a new Title IV to the
                    Department of State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC 4351, <hi
                        rend="italic">et seq</hi>.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government,
                    including facts that contributed to the formulation of policies and records that
                    provided supporting and alternative views to the policy positions ultimately
                    adopted.</p>
                <p>The statute confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles
                    of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or
                    deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been
                    made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in
                    reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of
                    concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30
                    years after the events recorded.</p>

                <p>The editors of this volume, which was compiled in 1991 and 1992, are convinced
                    that it meets all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly standards of selection
                    and editing. Although this volume records policies and events of more than 30
                    years ago, the statute of October 28, 1991, allows the Department until 1996 to
                    reach the 30-year line in the publication of the series.</p>

                    provide comprehensive documentation on all the major foreign policy decisions
                    and actions of the U.S. Government. It further requires that government
                    agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government cooperate with
                    the Department of State Historian by providing full and complete access to
                    records pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing
                    copies of selected records. The editors judge that this volume was prepared in
                    complete accordance with the standards and mandates of this statute.</p>

                <p>In planning and preparing this volume and the other five documenting U.S. foreign
                    policy regarding Europe during the <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                        >Kennedy</persName>
                    <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0005"/>administration, the editors concluded that
                    the records of the Department of State would constitute the central core of the
                    published record. In preparing this volume, Department of State historians have
                    enjoyed complete and unconditional access to all records and papers of the
                    Department of State: the central files of the Department; the special
                    decentralized (lot) files of the policymaking levels; the files of the
                    Department of State’s Executive Secretariat, which comprehend the official
                    papers created by or submitted to the Secretary of State; the files of all
                    overseas Foreign Service posts and U.S. special missions; and the official
                    correspondence with foreign governments and with other Federal agencies. Any
                    failure to include a complete Department of State record in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series cannot be attributed to
                    constraints or limitations placed upon the Department historians in their access
                    to Department records, information security regulations and practices
                    notwithstanding.</p>
                <p>The editors of this volume fully researched the papers of President <persName
                        corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and other White House foreign policy
                    records. These Presidential papers have become a major part of the official
                    record published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series.
                    Presidential papers maintained and preserved at the Presidential libraries
                    include some of the most significant foreign affairs-related documentation from
                    other Federal agencies including the National Security Council, the Central
                    Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
                    All of this documentation has been made available for use in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series thanks to the consent of these
                    agencies and the cooperation and support of the National Archives and Records
                    Administration. Particular thanks are due to officials at the <persName
                        corresp="#p_KJF1">John F. Kennedy</persName> Presidential Library for their
                    assistance in preparing this volume. These Presidential files were supplemented
                    by White House documents in Department of State files.</p>
                <p>The editors also had complete access to the papers of General <persName>Maxwell
                        Taylor</persName> at the National Defense University, which proved to be a
                    valuable source for documenting the formulation of policy under President
                        <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>. In addition, the editors
                    reviewed the body of declassified <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> files at
                    the National Archives and Records Administration. Copies of individual
                    classified <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> materials were obtained from the
                    Joint Staff on a request basis.</p>
                <p>Completion of the declassification of this volume and the final steps of its
                    preparation for publication coincided with the development since early 1991 by
                    the Central Intelligence Agency, in cooperation with the Department of State, of
                    access by Department historians to high-level intelligence documents from among
                    those records still in the custody of that Agency. The Department of State
                    historians have been provided selective access to particular special files of
                    the Agency. The Department has used this access, as arranged by the CIA’s
                    History Staff, in the compilation of this volume.</p>

                <p>The documentation printed in this volume presents the major actions and
                    discussions of the U.S. Government toward the states of Eastern Europe
                    (Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia), three
                    states of the Eastern Mediterranean (Greece, Cyprus, and Turkey), and Austria
                    and Finland.</p>
                <p>A single Eastern European regional compilation includes documentation on U.S.
                    relations with Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Romania. In general, these
                    documents illustrate the very limited contacts between the United States and
                    these satellite nations and focus primarily on limited economic ties.
                    Documentation on Hungarian efforts to secure a seat in the United Nations will
                    be printed in <ref target="frus1961-63v25">volume XXV</ref>, General; United
                    Nations. The documentation on Poland focuses on U.S. efforts to employ limited
                    economic assistance as a tool to gain diplomatic leverage with an important
                    Warsaw Pact state. Documentation relating to Yugoslavia deals with the
                    continuing U.S. policy of providing support to this Communist state in order to
                    ensure its independence from Soviet control.</p>
                <p>The Eastern Mediterranean was an area of growing tension and instability during
                    the early 1960s. The Cyprus portion of the volume outlines U.S. efforts to
                    promote intercommunal harmony and to establish a firm working relationship with
                    the government of the newly independent Cypriot Republic. Documentation on
                    Greece and Turkey deals with U.S. efforts to provide military and economic
                    assistance to these two states and ensure their domestic political
                    stability.</p>
                <p>This volume also provides coverage of U.S. relations with two important neutral
                    nations bordering on the Soviet Bloc. Documentation on Austria deals primarily
                    with U.S.-Austrian discussions regarding improvements in Austrian defense
                    capabilities. Documentation on Finland outlines the U.S. response to the
                    Finno-Soviet crisis of November 1961 and subsequent U.S. efforts to bolster
                    Finnish security and independence, including the question of arms supply.</p>

                    also took an active role in the details of policymaking regarding the Soviet
                    Bloc. The editors have sought to document all of this involvement.</p>
                <p>Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean Rusk</persName> outlined major
                    policy proposals for the President and made significant decisions within the

                    played continuous and important roles in the policy process.</p>
                <p>The editors have attempted to account for all of Secretary <persName

                    important meetings, decisions, and instructions he made. The editors have also
                    sought to present the major pieces of information and recommendations made by

                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time or, in
                    the case of conferences, in the order of individual meetings. Incoming telegrams
                    from U.S. Missions are placed according to time of receipt in the Department of
                    State or other receiving agency, rather than the time of transmission; memoranda
                    of conversation are placed according to the time and date of the conversation,
                    rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text
                    is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations,
                    which are described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed
                    according to accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents in
                    the limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied by the editors
                    for each document included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and
                    punctuation are retained as found in the source text, except that obvious
                    typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the
                    source text are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic
                    type; an addition in roman type. Words or phrases underlined in the source text
                    are printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in
                    the source text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the front matter of
                    each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for declassification purposes
                    have been accounted for and are listed by headings, source notes, and number of
                    pages not declassified in their chronological place. The amount of material
                    omitted from this print volume and from the microfiche supplement because it was
                    unrelated to the subject of the volume, however, has not been delineated. All
                    ellipses and brackets that appear in the source text are so identified by

                <p>The unnumbered first footnote to each document indicates the document’s source,
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. The source
                    footnote also provides the background of important documents and policies and
                    indicates if the President or his major policy advisers read the document. Every
                    effort has been made to determine if a document has been previously published,
                    and this information has been included in the source footnote.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts have been used when appropriate to

                <p>The declassification review of this volume in 1992 and 1993 resulted in the

                        <p>The enclosed letter of January 12, 1961,<note n="1" xml:id="d1fn1">Not
                                printed.</note> addressed to you by <persName>Cardinal Joseph
                                Mindszenty</persName> has been forwarded to the Department by the
                            Charge d’Affaires of our Legation in Budapest. In his letter the
                            Cardinal expresses his gratitude for the refuge which the United States
                            has afforded him within the Legation, appeals to you to decide whether
                            to continue or to terminate that refuge, and sets forth his personal
                            views on a number of political matters affecting Hungary.</p>
                        <p>The situation of the Cardinal, who has remained in refuge within the
                            premises of the Legation since November 4, 1956, is extremely delicate
                            and constitutes an unusual exception to the established policy of the
                            United States not to grant asylum in our diplomatic missions. In its
                            treatment of this special situation, the Department has considered it
                            very important to avoid any action which, by imparting a political
                            rather than a purely humanitarian character to the refuge we have
                            afforded the Cardinal, might cause embarrassment to the United States
                            Government, prejudice the continued safe refuge of the Cardinal, and
                            make the Legation’s position more difficult. In the light of these
                            considerations, the Department has adhered firmly to the policy that it
                            will not permit the Cardinal to use the Legation as a base for either
                            political or ecclesiastical activities, to give interviews, or to engage
                            in correspondence with persons outside the United States Government. The
                            only exception to this policy is that the Department is prepared to
                            transmit brief oral or unsealed written communications between the
                            Cardinal and the Vatican which are not of a political or ecclesiastical
                            nature but relate rather to the Cardinal’s position of refuge in the
                            Legation or to his personal spiritual problems and state of mind with
                            reference to his situation of refuge. Our policy, as stated above, has
                            been made clear to both the Vatican and the Cardinal. We are convinced
                            that continued adherence to this policy is in <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2"
                                facs="0024"/>the best interests not only of the United States but
                            also of the Cardinal himself.</p>
                        <p>Our established procedure for acknowledging the occasional communications
                            which the Cardinal has addressed to the President has been for the
                            Department to instruct the Charge d’Affaires merely to inform the
                            Cardinal orally that his message has been received in the White House.
                            In a few instances, where the contents warranted, a variation of this
                            procedure has been to instruct the Charge d’Affaires to inform the
                            Cardinal that his message has been received by the President (or in the
                            White House) and to add a word of appreciation or other brief
                            reassurance. This procedure has served the judicious purpose of avoiding
                            any direct and personal involvement of the President in correspondence
                            with the Cardinal and, thus, of precluding embarrassments that might
                            eventually arise from substantive written replies to the Cardinal’s
                            comments on sensitive political matters.</p>
                        <p>This Government’s position regarding the duration of Cardinal
                            Mindszenty’s present refuge has been that it will continue to afford him
                            refuge within the premises of the Legation so long as consideration for
                            his personal safety and freedom requires such an arrangement. The
                            Cardinal has been informed of this position on several occasions. In
                            October 1958, at the Vatican’s express request and with the Cardinal’s
                            reluctant acquiescence, the United States quietly made a formal request
                            to the Hungarian Government through the American Legation that Cardinal
                            Mindszenty be permitted to leave Hungary under assurances of safe
                            conduct and proceed to Rome to participate in the election of the new
                            Pope. This request was flatly rejected.</p>
                        <p>It is recommended, in accordance with the policy and procedure outlined
                            above, that you authorize the Department to instruct our Charge
                            d’Affaires at Budapest to inform the Cardinal orally that (1) you have
                            received with appreciation his letter of January 12; (2) you understand
                            fully his situation; and (3) you wish to reaffirm previous assurances
                            that the hospitality of the American Legation in Budapest remains
                            available to him and that this Government will continue to afford him
                            refuge in the Legation so long as consideration for his personal safety
                            and freedom requires such an arrangement.</p>
                        <p>If you approve the above recommendation, appropriate instructions will be
                            sent to our Charge d’Affaires.</p>

                        <p>325. Camsky, subject <persName>Dean</persName>’s March 31 letter to
                                Tims,<note n="1" xml:id="d2fn1">Not found.</note> is fourth case
                            past six months of <gloss target="#t_CSSR1">CSSR</gloss> secret police
                            whittling away veteran local employees, indicating systematic pattern.
                            Heretofore we have laboriously absorbed loss using American ceiling
                            complement. This cannot be done in case of language instructor; good
                            teacher essential to long-range aims of Embassy. Moreover, next logical
                            targets salami tactics are library assistants and publications
                            procurement clerk who have access local circles now impossible for
                            Americans. Replacement theoretically possible but loss present personnel
                            would seriously impair efficiency and morale of Embassy, increase risk
                            planned incident. Furthermore, if Camsky case should actually come off
                            as described, receiving large-scale publicity treatment, adverse effect
                            on development relations and on implementation our own aims in <gloss
                                target="#t_CSSR1">CSSR</gloss> might be considerable; this is
                            probably conjecture of instigators though we do not know how highly they
                            are placed or how their actions are reconcilable with such actions
                            Foreign Ministry as proposal cultural exchange.</p>
                        <p>I feel strongly we must make clear to governing <gloss target="#t_CSSR1"
                                >CSSR</gloss> personalities that harassment our employees can also
                            have adverse effect on <gloss target="#t_CSSR1">CSSR</gloss> national
                            interests rather than having no adverse effect whatever as heretofore.
                            US action now might protect remaining local employees, forestall further
                            development Camsky case.</p>
                        <p>Believe therefore we should make demarche based Kadainkova case, which is
                            only overtone, making it stand for situation all local employees.
                            Believe also essential that action be taken rapidly if at all before
                            police make irrevocable move Camsky gambit; deadline may come tomorrow.
                            Therefore recommend Department either authorize me see <persName
                                corresp="#p_HJ1">Hajek</persName> or that Department will call in
                            Ruzek. After general exchange on status mutual relations, progress
                            economic negotiations, et cetera (it preferable in interests of locals
                            that employee issue not be sole subject of discussion) would mention
                            Kadainkova note of March 28 (text, pouched Somerlatte April 1, merely
                            summarizes my oral interventions, asks final favorable response),
                            express hope for positive reply and then state that we did not believe
                            that US Government would desire take final steps toward conclusion
                            economic agreement, lifting personnel ceiling or reopening of
                            Consulates, until clear assurances received that operations <pb n="4"

                            to us. We must reserve right to insist that law-abiding employees of
                            Embassy should not be harassed or interfered with by Czech authorities
                            in any way because of Embassy employment; we consider Mrs.
                                <persName>Kadainkora</persName>’s case to stand for all local
                            employees. If further details asked for would remark that participants
                            aware facts of life in <gloss target="#t_CSSR1">CSSR</gloss> society and
                            for that reason do not propose go further than state our problems in
                            Prague not figments of imagination.</p>
                        <p>Because it overt, possibility of using Kadainkova case in combination
                            with Czech interest in economic agreements and increase of personnel
                            presents what may be our last handhold to limit police operations and
                            get some understanding on this point; if not used field will continue
                            open. With present circumscribed access for Americans and unimpeded
                            police operations against both American and local Embassy personnel, an
                            economic agreement, lifting of personnel ceiling and opening of
                            Consulates would be of dubious value to US.<note n="2" xml:id="d2fn2">In

                        <p>After exchanging greetings, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VP1"
                                >Voutov</persName> said that he wished to review US-Bulgarian
                            relations briefly. He then cited a number of Bulgarian initiatives as
                            evidence of their good will in improving relations; these included the
                            negotiations for the resumption of relations,<note n="1" xml:id="d3fn1"
                                >The United States and Bulgaria agreed to a resumption of diplomatic
                                relations on March 24, 1959. The United States had severed relations
                                in February 1950. For text of the Department of State statement on
                                the resumption of relations, see Department of State <hi

                            the financial claims discussions and proposals for a cultural agreement.
                            In addition, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Voutov</persName> reported
                            that the Bulgarians had established a trade mission here and were
                            seeking to expand commercial relations. He also suggested that we should
                            review our consular convention (sic) and up-date it. Although the
                            Bulgarians had undertaken all these steps, unfortunately relations had
                            not all gone smoothly.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Claims Negotiations</hi>. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VP1">Voutov</persName> then related his efforts to
                            resolve the impasse in the financial claims negotiations in discussions
                            with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> and reviewed the
                            amounts involved in the claims discussions. He said that he had advised
                            his Government of the $3.1 million value of the vested Bulgarian assets
                            as well as testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d3fn2">Apparently the reference is to 1959 hearings to

                            value of these assets should cover US claims against Bulgaria. Because
                            of this, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Voutov</persName> commented, he
                            had been surprised when the negotiations were suspended and his
                            Government had complained that it had been given a false impression.</p>

                                >Voutov</persName> next observed that until Bulgaria was granted
                            most-favored-nation (<gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>) status there
                            could be no real expansion of US-Bulgarian trade. A “platonic”
                            declaration on trade expansion was of no use. He handed the Secretary an
                            aide-memoire (a copy of which he had left with the Secretary of
                                Commerce)<note n="3" xml:id="d3fn3">Not found with the source

                            and added that while US-Bulgarian trade had historically been on the
                            order of $1 million annually in each direction, if Bulgaria were granted
                                <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> treatment it could buy goods
                            worth $10 million annually, while US imports from Bulgaria would total
                            $6–7 million. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Voutov</persName> also
                            mentioned that the Bulgarians would be requesting permission to open a
                            trade office in New York.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Cultural Relations</hi>. The Minister then listed the
                            various US performing artists who had appeared in Bulgaria during the
                            last year and said <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0028"/>that the
                            Bulgarians were ready to start discussions for the conclusion of an
                            agreement on cultural exchanges.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Irritants in US-Bulgarian Relations</hi>. Noting that
                            he was rather discouraged by certain recent developments, Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VP1">Voutov</persName> referred to an article on the
                            training of guerrilla forces (US News and World Report, March 13, 1961
                            with a photo of a class at Ft. Bragg studying Bulgarian military
                            phrases). He commented that such schools did not help US-Bulgarian
                            relations. The Bulgarians had no plans to overthrow the US Government
                            and the US “shouldn’t do so either.” He also referred to press articles
                            about a report on similar activities by General
                                <persName>Trudeau</persName>. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VP1"
                                >Voutov</persName> said that he had been instructed by his
                            Government to raise this matter and added that Sofia had asked whether
                            there was any connection between the appearance of these articles and
                            the suspension of the financial claims negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The Minister also made reference to statements in the Greek press denying
                            that the development of US-Bulgarian relations prejudiced US-Greek
                            relations.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Status of Missions</hi>. Finally, Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VP1">Voutov</persName> noted that the elevation of the
                            US and Bulgarian missions to the status of embassies had been foreseen
                            in the agreement on the resumption of relations. Although he had
                            subsequently raised this question on a number of occasions, he had had
                            no answer and, frankly, he felt that legations were an anachronism.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Secretary’s Reply</hi>. The Secretary welcomed a
                            chance to meet Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Voutov</persName> and
                            hoped that they would have an opportunity for another talk when they
                            were not so rushed. He continued that in our relations it was necessary
                            to leave aside points of difference and try to discover common
                            interests. This didn’t mean we should hide the fact that there were
                            far-reaching differences in our positions, as for example in our views
                            of the press, its role and how it should be handled. We shouldn’t
                            minimize these differences. We took a very serious view of the December
                            1960 Moscow communique of the Communist Parties.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d3fn4">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Current Digest of the
                                    Soviet Press</hi>, December 28, 1960, pp. 3–9, and January 4,
                                1961, pp. 3–8.</note> However, assuming these points of difference,
                            we must nevertheless try to find points for improvement of our
                            relations. The trend of history was too uncertain, despite the
                            Communists’ philosophy, for us not to seek such improvement by trying to
                            remove unnecessary irritants in our relations.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the specific points which Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VP1"
                                >Voutov</persName> had raised, the Secretary noted that expansion of
                            US-Bulgarian trade involved a number of legislative problems for us, as
                            well as the broader differences between state and private trading.
                            Because of his background as head of the <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7"
                                facs="0029"/>Rockefeller Foundation, the Secretary had a keen
                            interest in international exchanges, and we were anxious to explore the
                            possibilities in this field. We were prepared to start discussions on
                            cultural exchanges and also hoped for a resumption of the financial
                            negotiations. With regard to the status of our missions, the Secretary
                            said that we were seriously considering this matter and that he was
                            inclined to agree that legations were an anachronism. On the other hand,
                            this was not just a bilateral problem for us. The Secretary concluded by
                            saying that he would review with his colleagues the points which Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Voutov</persName> had raised and hoped
                            that they would have an opportunity for another talk.</p>

                        <p>Department agrees that Embassy should make an oral protest if the Czechs
                            reinstitute the type of aggressive surveillance and harassment described
                            in the airgram under reference. The Department should be notified as
                            soon as possible after a new period of intensified harassment is
                            instituted by the Czechs, and this notification should include the
                            Embassy’s judgment of the probable causes behind the action, a brief
                            survey of the methods used, and the Embassy’s opinion whether a protest
                            should be made. The Department would then be in a position to judge the
                            value of lodging a similar protest with the Czech Embassy.</p>
                        <p>The Department does not believe it would be either useful or practicable
                            to threaten reciprocity as a means of compelling the Czechs to desist
                            from harassment. Assuming that a future period of harassment will not go
                            beyond the limits encountered in the past, we believe that any oral
                            protest we make should follow the lines of the third paragraph of A–85

                            the President noted the economic background of the Minister and in
                            response to a question about Rumanian exports, there ensued a brief
                            exposition by the Minister of Rumania’s trade with the United States and
                            Western Europe.</p>
                        <pb n="11" xml:id="pg_11" facs="0033"/>
                        <p>The President remarked that we were, of course, interested in trade
                            development but noted that when there is political harmony, trade
                            increases. Unfortunately, existing political tensions were not
                            particularly favorable for the growth of trade. Our controls on
                            strategic goods affected only a small proportion of possible trade and,
                            moreover, many goods which we would not export could be obtained
                            elsewhere. However, as long as controls were part of the law of the land
                            and political tensions particularly in regard to Berlin were high,
                            prospects were not so favorable. He hoped that this would change if it
                            were possible to get a Berlin settlement.</p>
                        <p>The President asked the Minister whether the Common Market would affect
                            Rumanian trade. The Minister replied that they were not particularly
                            worried about this.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the Minister promised he would devote his best efforts to
                            improve trade with the United States and hoped thereby to contribute to
                            better relations.</p>

                        <p>After foregoing <persName corresp="#p_HJ1">Hajek</persName> turned to

                            we had agreed to in Principles which made commitment whereas he
                            considered aide-memoire only meeting this point halfway at most. I gave

                            have to stand on Principles. I assured him of our good faith in wishing
                            proceed with negotiations and pointed out that we unfortunately also had
                            some doubts regarding their point of view in respect inclusion new
                            language on debt claims in claims article. He said that only additions
                            they wished to make were caused by fact we were limiting our original
                            views as expressed in Principles and they had to meet these limitations
                            by additional phraseology on their part.</p>

                            they were in no hurry rush through agreement, that they would not be
                            pressured into accepting changes from Principles and he hoped we could

                            satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>As it now stands, problem is that Czechs insist that agreement on trade
                            office and statement have some status and force as economic agreement
                            itself. Department on other hand opposes inclusion trade point in

                            Department examine possibility of exchange of notes or of separate

                        <p>Upon authorization of the Acting Secretary an informal meeting was
                            arranged with <persName corresp="#p_VME1">Monsignor Egidio
                                Vagnozzi</persName>, Apostolic Delegate, for the purpose of leaving
                            with him a communication from Cardinal Mindszenty for transmission to
                            the Holy See.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VH1">Vedeler</persName> said that we had called
                            to bring a copy of a letter from His Eminence <persName>Josef Cardinal
                                Mindszenty</persName>.<note n="1" xml:id="d9fn1">Not printed.</note>
                            The background of this communication was a statement of Gyula Kallai,
                            Deputy Foreign Minister of the Hungarian regime, at a press conference
                            concerning the status of <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0037"/>Cardinal
                            Mindszenty. The Deputy Foreign Minister had been asked at this
                            conference on December 4 by a correspondent whether the Government of
                            Hungary would discuss the Cardinal’s future and on what basis the
                            problem might be settled. The reply was that the Hungarian Government
                            was prepared to discuss the matter only in connection with any
                            US-Hungarian negotiations on the improvement of relations between the
                            two countries. The Cardinal had learned of this statement and had
                            prepared a letter to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1"
                                >Rusk</persName> in which he expressed his views concerning his
                            situation of refuge. The Cardinal had asked that a copy of the letter be
                            brought to the attention of the Apostolic Delegate so that his views
                            could be made known to the Holy See.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VH1">Vedeler</persName> then outlined briefly
                            the following substance of the letter. The Cardinal had discussed three
                            possibilities of change in his status: (1) freedom and resumption of
                            ecclesiastical functions in Hungary; (2) release under conditions
                            imposed by the regime which would include the taking of an oath of
                            loyalty to the regime; and (3) departure from Hungary and resignation of
                            his functions. All of these alternatives were excluded by the Cardinal
                            who indicated he did not seek a change in his status under the existing
                            circumstances. Principal reasons for his stand were the imprisonment
                            suffered by Bishops in Hungary, by many members of the clergy and by
                            thousands of the faithful; the deportation of Hungarians and the lot of
                            their families; the damages to the Church caused by the regime and the
                            interference in religious affairs in Hungary. The Cardinal also made the
                            point that the Hungarian regime in any event had no serious intentions
                            in his case and was only using his name as a decoy. He mentioned further
                            that the Primate in Hungary could not be used as a counter or for barter
                            purposes even when the end might be desirable. The letter thus gave as a
                            whole a clear indication that the Cardinal considered the only course
                            open to him for the present was to remain in refuge in the Legation.</p>
                        <p>The Apostolic Delegate suggested that there was a fourth alternative
                            which the Cardinal had not mentioned. This was for him to depart from
                            Hungary to establish residence abroad without giving up his
                            ecclesiastical functions although not exercising them in practice. The
                            Apostolic Delegate’s belief, however, was that the best course was for
                            the Cardinal to remain in Hungary in the existing situation since he was
                            needed there as a source of inspiration and encouragement to the
                            Hungarian people. In response to a question <persName corresp="#p_VME1"
                                >Monsignor Vagnozzi</persName> indicated that he believed the Holy
                            See preferred this course. He said that the continuation of this
                            situation depended to be sure on the attitude of the US toward the
                            Cardinal’s refuge in the Legation. He recognized that this presented
                            some problems for the US and asked about the attitude of the US
                            concerning its willingness for the Cardinal to remain.</p>
                        <pb n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0038"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VH1">Vedeler</persName> replied that he was
                            authorized by the Department to say: (1) it was agreeable to the US for
                            the Cardinal to continue his refuge in the Legation in the present
                            circumstances; (2) the present time and situation were in our view not
                            favorable for the US to take any initiative which would have the purpose
                            of resolving the problem of the Cardinal’s refuge; and (3) we believed
                            that any efforts of this nature should be deferred until developments in
                            US-Hungarian relations would open up a prospect of success for such
                            efforts. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VH1">Vedeler</persName> then passed a
                            copy of the attached letter from Cardinal Mindszenty to the Apostolic
                            Delegate on a confidential basis. In accepting the communication
                                <persName corresp="#p_VME1">Monsignor Vagnozzi</persName> said that
                            he would send it to the Holy See and if there were any reply he would
                            communicate with us.</p>
                        <p>There was some discussion thereafter of the health of Cardinal Mindszenty
                            at the present time. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VH1">Vedeler</persName>
                            said that the Cardinal was in reasonably good health in view of his age
                            and his present circumstances. The US had arranged for visits of doctors
                            from time to time for examination of his health and there had been no
                            serious problem so far. If the Cardinal became ill so that he required
                            continuing medical attention a problem would arise and we hoped that
                            this might be avoided so long as the Cardinal remained in the
                            Legation.</p>
                        <p>With this the visit came to a conclusion and the Apostolic Delegate
                            thanked us for coming.</p>

                            <item>On March 20 the Secretary met, at his invitation, with Foreign
                                Minister <persName corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> and Vice
                                Foreign Minister Macovescu at the U.S. Mission for forty-five
                                minutes. General expressions of hope for improved relations between
                                the US and Rumania were exchanged. At the close of session, the
                                Secretary expressed the hope that it would be possible to proceed
                                with the consular arrangements under discussion, to which the
                                Foreign Minister heartily agreed, adding also the question of

                            <item>On disarmament, the Secretary stated the meetings to date had not
                                been very encouraging, but that he has some hope. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> said he was glad to hear
                                this, that he hoped the Conference would be fruitful. There was no
                                discussion of regional disarmament (<persName corresp="#p_MC1"
                                    >Manescu</persName>, in his speech that same morning, had
                                reaffirmed Rumanian interest in a nuclear free Balkan zone), nor of
                                any other disarmament problem.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>In general East-West relations, <persName corresp="#p_MC1"
                                    >Manescu</persName> mentioned as an irritant in US-Rumanian
                                relations “Captive Nations Week” in the United States. The Secretary
                                responded that we have no desire to interfere in any other
                                countries’ internal institutions, including whatever the Russians
                                want or even whatever they will tolerate, but that there were
                                periodic congresses of communist states and communist parties
                                proclaiming their dedication to communizing the world, and that
                                “Captive Nations Week” was nothing in comparison. But we do care
                                about what threats are placed on others. There are, he noted, no
                                major problems in US–USSR bilateral relations—but we were not
                                indifferent to the fate of others.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>The Secretary noted that the US was not prepared to place trust in
                                Moscow, nor did we expect Moscow to place trust in us. We favored
                                reciprocal arrangements which would avert the necessity for having
                                to rely on trust. The Secretary noted that we cannot start fresh
                                each day on questions of trust, and we could not forget the past
                                sixteen years. In 1946 the US had virtually disarmed—we had not a
                                single combat-ready ground division or air group. We had tried to
                                get real international control over all atomic energy, though we
                                then had a monopoly. But we have had to rearm and quadruple our
                                defense expenditures because of the whole series of crises which
                                have filled the docket of the UN over these sixteen years. Moscow
                                had made a serious tactical error; if it had not stimulated crisis
                                after crisis, the American people would have been disarmed and
                                isolationist in a decade.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>The Secretary said that we don’t hold Bucharest responsible for
                                all Bloc policies. We know there are broad differences between us
                                not within Bucharest’s control. <persName corresp="#p_MC1"
                                    >Manescu</persName> inquired what these differences were. The
                                Secretary replied: Berlin and Southeast Asia, to mention two “little
                                problems.” <persName corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> commented
                                that we should not attribute to Moscow views to which they ascribe;
                                that they (the Rumanians) also <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0040"
                                />held such views on Berlin, for example, and that they were after
                                all part of the socialist bloc. This was a fact that should be
                                recognized after sixteen years. Also, that Rumania had twice this
                                century suffered from Germany.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>On Berlin, the Secretary noted that the arguments raised were
                                circular: we should leave Berlin because the war was long over, and
                                East Germany was a “fact.” But West Berlin and Western presence
                                there was also a fact. Just as one cannot argue that East Berlin has
                                been settled and only West Berlin can be discussed, so one cannot
                                argue that East Germany is a fact and that West Berlin is not.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> noted the
                                geographical status of West Berlin as an exclave in East Germany.
                                The Secretary remarked that geographical facts should not be
                                mistaken for political ones.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>The Secretary emphasized: the West is in West Berlin, and has
                                access to it, and intends to remain. It’s as simple as that. If this
                                is fully understood, many other things will fall into place. If not,
                                I would hate to predict the future. <persName corresp="#p_MC1"
                                    >Manescu</persName> was visibly impressed by this statement. He
                                noted that the talks between Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1"
                                    >Thompson</persName> and Foreign Minister <persName
                                    corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> seem to have not succeeded,
                                but they need not be the end. The Secretary agreed and stressed the
                                importance of major adversaries remaining in contact on the points
                                of difference between them. <persName corresp="#p_MC1"
                                    >Manescu</persName> inquired how long we thought Western
                                occupation troops would need to remain in Berlin. The Secretary
                                declared that they would remain as long as necessary to prevent
                                World War III. <persName corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> said a
                                peace treaty was necessary. The Secretary stated that a treaty
                                ending the last war was less important than any action which would
                                threaten to precipitate a new war. There was another possible
                                solution: an all German peace treaty. <persName corresp="#p_MC1"
                                    >Manescu</persName> said this was a new idea; the Secretary
                                remarked it was a very old one. The Secretary said we should not be
                                accused of procrastination; the Soviets had proposed certain things
                                three years ago, we had proposed others, and while we have not
                                agreed to theirs, they likewise have not agreed to ours. Neither
                                should be said to be stalling more than the other. Moreover, if one
                                asks us to hurry, we must ask: hurry to what?</item>

                        <p>The Czechs were cold, unyielding, and the most firm parrot of the Soviet
                            line on Berlin and Germany of all Satellite representatives here.
                            Disarmament was not discussed. The meeting was held on March 22 at the
                            Palais lounge, on the initiative of the Secretary, and lasted about one
                            hour.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary hoped that we could improve our relations, which both
                            agreed had not been very good. <persName corresp="#p_DV1"
                                >David</persName> suggested in a very wooden way that perhaps we
                            could expand our cultural and technical exchanges, etc. The Secretary
                            noted that larger issues impinge on U.S.-Czech relations, such as the
                            Moscow–Prague relationship, the Berlin issue, and Czech-Cuban relations.
                            On the last of these, we and other governments in the Western hemisphere
                            were aware of Czech shipments of arms, and illicit Cuban transshipment
                            to other countries. These issues affected our policy, and also sometimes
                            affected public congressional debates in ways not reflecting policy.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DV1">David</persName> stated that he had understood
                            our present negotiations on a bilateral agreement did not require
                            congressional ratification. The Secretary explained that that
                            understanding was correct, that we were negotiating an executive
                            agreement and he had not meant to imply that ratification by the Senate
                            would be required. He was speaking, the Secretary said, about public
                            policy debate which would doubtless attend publicity on such an
                            agreement, and such debate would be affected by the prevailing political
                            climate.</p>
                        <p>On Berlin, <persName corresp="#p_DV1">David</persName> stated that there
                            was no need for the issue to arise or have any influence on the
                            U.S.-Czech relations. The Czechs had suffered from German aggression,
                            were for liquidation of the remnants of World War II on the basis of the
                            existence of the two German states, who <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20"
                                facs="0042"/>were neighbors of Czechoslovakia. The Secretary noted
                            that West Berlin and Western presence and access thereto was as much a
                            fact as anything in Germany. The Secretary stated that the West was in
                            West Berlin, had access to Berlin, and would leave only by its consent,
                            which would not be given under present circumstances. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DV1">David</persName> rejoined that the Soviet proposals
                            for a Berlin settlement and for a German peace treaty were just and were
                            supported by Czechoslovakia. The occupation regime, he stated, must be
                            ended.</p>
                        <p>On Cuba, <persName corresp="#p_DV1">David</persName> replied that
                            Czechoslovakia had relations with states of various political systems,
                            and had relations with Cuba on the basis of equality and mutual
                            noninterference in internal affairs. (<persName corresp="#p_DV1"
                                >David</persName> started to make a comment on the question of arms,
                            but changed his mind and with <persName corresp="#p_HJ1"

                                Lot 65 D 533, CF 2060)</note> and asked if there were any points
                            requiring further exchange of views. <persName corresp="#p_DV1"
                                >David</persName>, and then <persName corresp="#p_HJ1"
                                >Hajek</persName>, addressed this point, insisting that the U.S. was
                            departing from the agreed principles initialled on December 8. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HJ1">Hajek</persName> said that some differences were
                            minor and could be explained as differences in interpretation, but that
                            two were substantial. One was the question of inclusion of trade
                            provisions in the general agreement so as to give them equal value
                            (standing). The second point was an alleged U.S. narrowing of the scope
                            of the agreed principles by our present definition of the claims to be
                            covered. The Secretary said we were not deviating from the December
                            agreed principles as we saw them. There was no conclusive agreement on
                            the proposal for an exchange of letters on the trade provisions. On the
                            question of claims, the Czech position was uncompromising.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary proposed, and it was agreed, that the negotiators should
                            continue to work out the agreement in full. The Secretary noted,
                            however, that final conclusion of the agreement would depend upon the
                            general climate at the time. The Secretary and <persName
                                corresp="#p_DV1">David</persName> agreed that the agreement could
                            be, in terms of disarmament language, a “first stage” in improvement of
                            U.S.-Czech relations.</p>

                            measures”.</p>
                        <p>Geneva conversations (which connected economic agreement with Berlin,
                            Cuban issues) indicate that US not prepared finally conclude agreement
                            even on our own previously proffered terms. (Department will recall that
                            on instruction (Department telegram 349)<note n="4" xml:id="d12fn4"
                                >Telegram 349, March 23, outlined final U.S. requirements for
                                conclusion of a trade agreement. (Ibid., 611.494/3–2362)</note>
                            Embassy had few days prior Geneva talks expressed readiness conclude
                            agreement immediately.) Our present negotiating position thus
                            understandably weaker, for Czechs now have no impelling grounds adjust
                            their position for sake of gold or other benefits they would receive if
                            agreement were to enter into effect near future.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless I would suggest one further effort be made move negotiations
                            forward but only if Department prepared make concessions outlined above.
                            I make this recommendation because (1) we cannot be certain that Czechs
                            unwilling initial agreement without signing unless we do try; (2) if we
                            make one further effort meet their position and negotiations break, onus
                            will be more on them than at present and we will have sacrificed nothing
                            of substance; (3) we may thus be able salvage agreed portions of
                            agreement as starting point future negotiations; (4) increasing <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> pressure applied not only in TGC but at
                            high Foreign Ministry level may in time force us to release Czech gold
                            independently outside of agreement, whereupon we would lose our leverage
                            to achieve settlement.</p>
                        <p>Suggest therefore I be authorized approach Czechs, advance as our final
                            position: (1) Text of letter exchange on trade contained Department
                            telegram 364; (2) text claims article incorporating language conforming
                            principles settlement (March 15 draft).</p>
                        <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0044"/>
                        <p>Under altered negotiating circumstances I cannot be overly hopeful this
                            position will result in Czech agreement to text but for reasons stated
                            believe it worth try. In event Department unable approve final position
                            stated preceding paragraph or Czechs refuse accept it if advanced,
                            believe suspension negotiations only course.<note n="5" xml:id="d12fn5"

                        <p>At the request of the Apostolic Delegate the Department’s representatives
                            called on him this morning to receive a message from the Vatican
                            concerning the communication from Cardinal Mindszenty (a letter to
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> which the Cardinal
                            had requested be made known to the Apostolic Delegate), copy of which
                            was given <persName corresp="#p_VME1">Monsignor Vagnozzi</persName> on
                            February 13 for transmission to the Holy See.<note n="1" xml:id="d13fn1"
                                >See <ref target="#d9">Document 9</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>The Apostolic Delegate said that the Cardinal’s letter had been sent to
                            Rome and a response to his (the Apostolic Delegate’s) report had now
                            been received. Cardinal Cicognani had discussed the matter with the
                            Pope, who agreed that in the present circumstances it is best for
                            Cardinal Mindszenty to remain in his situation of refuge in our
                            Legation. The Pope and Cardinal Cicognani also believed that the
                            existing conditions were not suitable for undertaking efforts to solve
                            the problem of the Cardinal’s refuge. They were pleased to have word
                            (conveyed by the Department’s representatives at our previous meeting on
                            February 13) that the Cardinal’s health was reasonably good for his
                            situation. They <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0045"/>expressed their
                            appreciation for the Department’s willingness to have Cardinal
                            Mindszenty continue his refuge in the Legation and for the care and
                            attention given him by our Mission at Budapest.</p>
                        <p>After communicating this message <persName corresp="#p_VME1">Monsignor
                                Vagnozzi</persName> added that Vatican circles considered that under
                            present conditions it was desirable for the Cardinal to remain in
                            Hungary as the spiritual leader of the Hungarian people and that his
                            departure from the country now might have a depressing effect on the
                            spirit of the people.</p>
                        <p>In connection with this subject <persName corresp="#p_VME1">Monsignor
                                Vagnozzi</persName> referred to concern in Vatican circles about the
                            possible visit by the Secretary General of the United Nations to Hungary
                            in response to the invitation extended by the Hungarian regime. He
                            mentioned a report that <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss> Thant was going
                            to Czechoslovakia, Poland and “another country”, possibly the Soviet
                            Union. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VH1">Vedeler</persName> said we
                            understood that the Secretary General was planning a trip to Europe this
                            year during which he would visit a number of countries including the
                            Soviet Union. We did not know whether he was going to visit Hungary.</p>
                        <p>As the meeting came to a close Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VH1"
                                >Vedeler</persName> expressed the Department’s appreciation for the
                            message conveyed by the Apostolic Delegate and said that he would make a
                            record of it which would be brought to the attention of the higher
                            officers concerned in the Department.</p>

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Voutov</persName> began by referring to
                            his eight years of diplomatic service in Washington and in New York at
                            the United Nations and by expressing <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24"
                                facs="0046"/>his deep gratitude for what the Secretary and his
                            deputies had done for him and for the Bulgarian mission. He noted that
                            the last three years had been particularly important because a start was
                            made toward repairing the damage in US-Bulgarian relations. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Voutov</persName> said he conceived that
                            his primary task had been to find the best way to develop relations. In
                            looking back, he believed that, although many things still had to be
                            done, relations had been normalized by the exchange of diplomatic
                            missions, by the resolution of some consular problems and the initiation
                            of cultural exchanges and trade. Bulgarians had been happy to have
                            American singers, professors, sportsmen and tourists visit their
                            country. While we were still at the beginning stage of our relations,
                            this was not a bad beginning. With good will, both sides could do more
                            in promoting an active attitude toward relations and in finding a basis
                            for mutual understanding. Both big countries and small could contribute
                            to better relations, each going its own way and respecting the way of
                            others. In his fifteen years of diplomatic service, more than half had
                            been spent in the US. This period had been a kind of school for him and
                            he expected, in whatever his future position might be, to do his best to
                            help his Government in the consideration of its policies towards the
                            US.</p>
                        <p>The Bulgarian Minister mentioned the recent graduation of his daughter,
                            Svetlana, from Woodrow Wilson High School. She had just competed with
                            400 other Bulgarian and foreign students for one of the fifty available
                            places in Sofia University and had come out first. Thus, at sixteen and
                            a half years of age, she would be the youngest student in the
                            University. In answer to a question, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VP1"
                                >Voutov</persName> said that his son, who had been at Brightwood
                            School, spoke Bulgarian badly, putting Bulgarian endings on English
                            words.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Voutov</persName> stated that he wished to
                            mention the most important element affecting the development of
                            relations—namely, the question of a financial settlement. He noted that
                            negotiating delegations had met for several months before negotiations
                            were suspended and that informal conversations had been held since that
                            time. The amount of the claims was on the verge of agreement when the
                            difference in the positions of the two Governments reached only
                            $200,000. At the last moment, he said, a new figure for the value of
                            Bulgarian assets was given because the Office of Alien Property had
                            erred in its evaluation of Bulgarian blocked and vested assets and the
                            US asked for $550,000 cash above the value of Bulgarian vested assets.
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Voutov</persName> assured the Secretary
                            that Bulgaria wished to settle the claims issue but not at any price. He
                            appealed to the Department and to the Secretary personally to do
                            everything possible to settle this problem. In Bulgaria, the Government
                            was prepared to give something above the value of vested assets but
                            questioned what Bulgaria would receive in return. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VP1">Voutov</persName> said that he knew about the
                            most-favored-nation problem. An attempt was being <pb n="25"
                                xml:id="pg_25" facs="0047"/>made to trade in small quantities, as
                            the Department of Commerce proposed, but even this was difficult. The
                            Bulgarian trade mission was sitting in Washington instead of New York
                            because the question of a trade office in New York was tied up with the
                            claims settlement. Trade would help provide Bulgaria with foreign
                            currency to pay off the claims. A cultural exchanges program also
                            required foreign currency. Concluding, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VP1"
                                >Voutov</persName> emphasized that both sides must make an effort to
                            settle this problem of claims.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he would review the claims problem.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that, by way of a personal remark, he felt the
                            Bulgarian Minister, as an individual, had tried his best, within the
                            limited possibilities of the policies of the US and Bulgarian
                            Governments and the larger questions in which they were involved, to
                            improve relations between our two countries and the US appreciated
                            this.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted that there were no issues between the American and
                            Bulgarian peoples. Historic ties of friendship existed between them.
                            Furthermore, Bulgaria’s internal social system was its own affair and
                            did not constitute an obstacle to good relations. However, there were
                            some limitations of an overriding nature which the international scene
                            imposed on both countries and which affected bilateral relations. These
                            limitations necessarily placed obstacles and difficulties in the way of
                            our relations. Nevertheless, the US would like to improve its bilateral
                            relations with Bulgaria to the extent that these overriding
                            international problems permit. This means that there are certain things
                            which each side must be aware of. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VP1"
                                >Voutov</persName>, he presumed, was familiar with the role of
                            Congress in foreign affairs. We must have patience, persistence and good
                            will in order to improve bilateral relations. The US has no hostility
                            toward Bulgaria but the international problems in which Bulgaria is
                            necessarily involved are of very much concern to the US.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the Secretary told Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VP1"
                                >Voutov</persName> that he had made a contribution to improved
                            relations. He hoped Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Voutov</persName> was
                            leaving the US with a sense of satisfaction and expressed his personal
                            regard and that of his colleagues for Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VP1"
                                >Voutov</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Voutov</persName> replied he had always
                            met with understanding in the Department.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary mentioned he had been most disturbed last year over the
                            street attacks on members of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VP1"
                                >Voutov</persName>’s staff. He said he could well understand how the
                            affair could be regarded in the Bulgarian view as something other than a
                            coincidence. He had been distressed that these incidents had raised
                            questions which had not been in our minds.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Voutov</persName> replied that those far
                            away (in Bulgaria) could not understand the affair or how it was
                            possible.</p>

                        <p>I paid a protocol call on Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Todor
                                Zhivkov</persName> on November 28, 1962, having requested an
                            appointment prior to my departure for consultations in Washington. The
                            Prime Minister received me very cordially, and our conversation was
                            animated and extended, lasting fifty minutes. Also present were Deputy
                            Foreign Minister Angelov, Foreign Ministry interpreter Gerasimov who did
                            all the interpreting and Cultural Officer Bloomfield.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> began by thanking me
                            for my visit and apologizing for his lack of diplomatic experience. He
                            said that his background had been entirely political, and that since
                            this is his first government post<note n="1" xml:id="d16fn1"><persName
                                    corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> was elected Prime Minister

                            little knowledge of diplomacy and protocol. He added that inasmuch as my
                            background is also mainly political we should be able to understand each
                            other.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister referred to his visit to the US in 1960,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d16fn2"><persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> was a
                                member of the Bulgarian Delegation to the 15th session of the U.N.
                                General Assembly in New York September–December 1960.</note> saying
                            that he had enjoyed it greatly and that the State Department had been
                            most helpful to him. He said that he had become good friends with the
                            policemen who had protected him (of whom he had seen more than anyone
                            else). He had been grateful for his tour of various industrial plants,
                            cities, etc. in the US. He said he had been able to see everything he
                            wanted.</p>
                        <p>There were other preliminary niceties, while a waiter served us with
                            Slivova and Turkish coffee. The Prime Minister told a rather indelicate
                            story about a peasant from his home village, and I noted that the
                            Foreign Office interpreter hesitated slightly before repeating a
                            somewhat vulgar “peasant” remark.</p>

                        <p>After the usual toasts, I asked the Prime Minister to interpret for me
                            the sweeping changes in the Bulgarian Government which had just
                            occurred.</p>
                        <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0050"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> began by saying that
                            all these changes had been fully reported and explained in the press,
                            and that the meaning of events was precisely that which had been
                            publicized. (I am inclined to think that the fact that <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> stressed that “all” had been
                            published means the opposite.) He said that Prime Minister Yugov and
                            Tsankov had been ousted because of (1) Crimes against the State. (2)
                            Undermining Central Committee policies. (3) Hindering democratization of
                            the Country. (4) Yugov pursuing “careerist” tendencies. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> maintained that these were the
                            only reasons for Yugov’s ouster. I felt that he stressed this a little
                            too much, and was overly anxious for me to believe that there were no
                            other factors behind Yugov’s dismissal. He said that Yugov had failed to
                            carry out the directives of the Party, and therefore he had to go, just
                            the same as he, <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName>, would
                            have to take his hat and go if he failed to carry out the Party’s
                            orders. However, he added laughingly that he did not wish to leave the
                            office he had just assumed and therefore he intended to carry out the
                            Party’s directives.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> went on to say that the
                            many other changes in the Government were necessitated not because of
                            political factors, but because of the need to bring new, young blood
                            into the Government and also to carry out the Party plans for more
                            scientific and technical development. The Prime Minister noted the
                            presence of several academicians in the new Government, and remarked
                            also that the Party’s new plans require that experts be placed in
                            charge. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> pointed
                            particularly to new Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BK1"
                                >Bashev</persName>, stating that he is well qualified with a
                            background in ideological training and that he speaks four languages. He
                            said that Former Foreign Minister Lukanov and also the former Minister
                            of Transport Dimitrov, for example, were not dismissed because of any
                            failures or wrongdoings (such as Yugov’s and Tsankov’s) but only because
                            of poor health and overly-long tenure. He added that most of the former
                            officials would be retained in the Government, but given lesser
                            jobs.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister stressed the need for Governmental reorganization, and
                            mentioned in particular that the Foreign Office will be reorganized.</p>
                        <p>Since he had emphasized Governmental plans, I asked him if this meant
                            that the Government would assume a greater role than the Party in
                            directing the affairs of the country. He said not at all, simply that
                            the Government will have to carry out the policies and plans of the
                            Party. He repeated that if he, as Prime Minister, did not carry out
                            Party orders then he would be thrown out, the same as Yugov had been. (I
                            believe that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> repeated
                            this idea at least three times which makes me think that he is somewhat
                            uneasy over the way in which he has reached the Premiership. Perhaps it
                            is also a case of “uneasy is the head that <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29"
                                facs="0051"/>wears the crown”.) Yesterday it was Yugov, today it is
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName>, and tomorrow—?</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Bulgarian Internal and Foreign
                                Policy</hi></p>
                        <p>I then asked the Prime Minister what would be the principal changes one
                            could expect in the internal and external policies of the new
                            government. His reply as regards internal policies followed the same
                            lines he had already mentioned, greater scientific and technical
                            development carrying out the 20-year Plan etc. He was not specific, and
                            did not mention agriculture. He referred briefly to the need to develop
                            transportation and industry, but dwelt mostly on generalities about
                            carrying out the Party’s directives and the 20-year Plan which had all
                            been published, he said.</p>
                        <p>Then Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> turned to the
                            question of foreign policy which, he said, would continue to follow the
                            same lines of peaceful coexistence and friendship with all nations. He
                            said: “We are even trying to improve relations with Turkey, which is an
                            ally of the US. While the Ottoman Turkey oppressed Bulgaria for 500
                            years, we do not hold this against the present Turkish Government, with
                            which we want good relations.” Although Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZT1"
                                >Zhivkov</persName> spoke for several minutes about Bulgaria’s
                            continuing to adhere to “peaceful coexistence” policies, he did not
                            mention the Soviet Union (or Yugoslavia) at this point, nor indeed
                            throughout the entire conversation.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Relations with the United
                            States</hi></p>
                        <p>I asked the Prime Minister how the new Government’s foreign policy might
                            affect Bulgaria’s relations with the United States. He began by replying
                            emphatically that he wants to improve relations with the US, in
                            particular in the economic and political spheres.</p>
                        <p>As for political relations with the US, the Prime Minister said that the
                            first problem is that Bulgaria is a small, poor nation and the US is a
                            great, rich one. He said that Bulgaria is sensitive about being ignored
                            or treated as if it were not important. He said that Bulgaria has felt
                            that the US had not regarded Bulgaria with the principle of equality
                            which even small nations deserve. He declared that in spite of our
                            ideological differences the US had nothing to fear from Bulgaria, and
                            that Bulgaria is not going to try to bolshevize the US. He added that
                            neither is Bulgaria afraid of the US and it does not feel that we will
                            be able to exert much influence on it. He said that I had been in this
                            country several months now and must be aware of the feelings of the
                            people. (This was apparently a veiled reference to Bulgarian-Soviet
                            attachments, implying that the people heartily support the Soviet
                            Union.)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> then went on to say that
                            economic relations are the most important of all, and that up until now
                            there has been practically no <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0052"
                            />trade with the US. He said that Bulgaria’s export potentialities to
                            the US would be, at best, “but a drop in the sea” to a big country like
                            the US, and he could not understand why there could not be more trade
                            between the two countries.</p>
                        <p>I replied that this would be difficult to develop, but not impossible. I
                            pointed out that the U.S. produces great surpluses of tobacco and foods,
                            which might be the very things Bulgaria would like to sell to us. His
                            response was almost pleading, “But it surely should be possible for
                            Bulgaria to sell some canned foods and attar of roses oil!”</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then introduced the subject of the financial claims
                            negotiations which he said he understands have been an obstacle in
                            improving relations with the U.S. He declared that this problem must be
                            settled now, and that so far as Bulgaria is concerned this should not be
                            difficult. No amount of money is too great to pay for the improvement of
                            relations between the U.S. and Bulgaria, he said, whether it is $350,000
                            or $10 million! Even for Bulgaria, which is a poor country, no amount is
                            too great for improving our relations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZT1"
                                >Zhivkov</persName> looked directly at Minister Angelov, laughed and
                            said, “Perhaps I will get into trouble with the Foreign Office
                            diplomats, but this is what I think! The next time you and I meet to
                            discuss these questions, we should not have any Foreign Office official
                            present, only our interpreters.”</p>
                        <p>Later on he again said, “You can go to the Protocol Section for the
                            routine things, but when you really want to discuss something serious
                            and worthwhile and of some importance, then come directly to me. We can
                            talk it over. If you want to talk to me as a friend on any kind of
                            subject, then I will be only too happy to see you any time and we will
                            be able to reach a decision.”</p>
                        <p>Finally the Prime Minister mentioned that cultural relations should be
                            improved too but that he does not view them as of the same importance as
                            economic and political. He made a reference to Bulgaria’s inability to
                            finance an American “ensemble” in exchange for the Kutev Ensemble’s
                            forthcoming tour of the U.S., adding that the “principle of reciprocity”
                            must be observed. (Apparently Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZT1"
                                >Zhivkov</persName> was not well informed on this question.) He
                            clearly does not attach much importance to cultural relations.</p>
                        <p>In my response to the Prime Minister’s various points I emphasized my
                            belief that the development of relations between the U.S. and Bulgaria
                            must proceed in all 3 areas—political, economic and cultural—which are
                            interrelated. I referred to our country’s traditional and firm belief in
                            the sovereignty and independence of small nations, whose rights we would
                            continue to respect. I said that it was true that relations had not been
                            good between Bulgaria and the U.S., but that this was due first of all
                            to world political factors beyond his control or mine. I also pointed
                            out that geographically Bulgaria is remote from the U.S. and <pb n="31"
                                xml:id="pg_31" facs="0053"/>that people in the U.S. simply have not
                            known much about Bulgaria. Now the possibilities for communications are
                            improving, I said, and we should take advantage of this period.</p>
                        <p>As for the financial claims issue, I said I heartily agree with him that
                            this problem should be settled forthwith, and that I was delighted to
                            hear him say that it should not be difficult to conclude an agreement. I
                            said that it had seemed most unfortunate that U.S.-Bulgarian relations
                            had been static, simply because of a difference of a few hundred
                            thousand dollars. I hoped that we could settle this issue at once and
                            move on to more constructive relations.</p>
                        <p>I stated my belief that cultural relations are important and have a
                            bearing on political and economic development, since people must get to
                            know each other better if trade and political understanding are to
                            increase.</p>
                        <p>Just before concluding our discussion, I asked the Prime Minister whether
                            a new Bulgarian Minister to the U.S. has been chosen yet. He replied
                            that due to the pressures of the Party Congress there had not been time
                            to select a new candidate, but he assured me there will be a good man
                            named soon.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked me to convey his greetings to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, for whom he
                            expressed high regard and respect, and to inform President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> of Bulgaria’s desire for better
                            economic and political relations with the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> also asked me to visit
                            him upon my return from the U.S. and added that he would always be at my
                            disposal. He expressed the hope that we could settle many problems, and
                            work together to improve relations between Bulgaria and the U.S.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Personal Observations and
                                Comments</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> has an unassuming
                            manner, at first impressing one as a quiet man. However, he is also
                            talkative and laughs robustly and often. He may affect a <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchevian</persName> style in his deliberate
                            attempt to be hearty, and at times play the buffoon. He wagged his
                            finger at me to emphasize a point, a mannerism to which I believe
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is given.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> spoke proudly of his
                            peasant origins and his native village, which is famous for slivova and
                            slivova-drinking. His manners are a bit crude, although he was courteous
                            and most cordial to me.</p>
                        <p>I believe that a certain rapport was established between us. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName>’s personality is quite
                            different than Yugov’s, who impressed me as a hard, cruel, cold and
                            ruthless man. <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName>, by
                            contrast, is capable of acting in an affable, flexible manner. He does
                            not convey an impression of great strength or intelligence. One would
                            judge him to be a “follower” rather than a “leader”, which may be
                            significant in view of his devotion to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> and the Soviet line.</p>
                        <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0054"/>
                        <p>I was struck by <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName>’s frequent
                            references to his own inexperience, “poor abilities” and “incapable
                            qualities”. Either he must have deep feelings of inferiority, or else
                            the opposite belief in his superiority which he tries to conceal by
                            frequent self-denigrations. Whatever the case, his manner and bearings
                            are those of a modest man.</p>
                        <p>Whether <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName>’s emphatic
                            assertions of his willingness to settle the claims issue now at whatever
                            the cost represent a genuine determination on his part, I cannot be
                            sure. He appeared to mean what he said, but only time will tell. I
                            believe that we should soon test his intentions.</p>
                        <p>I also believe that <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName>’s
                            emphasis on Bulgaria’s sensitivity and desire to be treated “as an
                            equal” and not to be ignored, offer some possibilities for the U.S.
                            which I hope to exploit.</p>

                            these been underway since 1955; each of my predecessors had expressed
                            hope upon arrival that they could be concluded and agreement signed. He
                            referred specifically to signing of “principles” year ago; progress had
                            been made subsequently but none recently. Stated only few matters
                            unresolved and expressed belief that with goodwill they could be

                            desirable and “could be big help” in achieving improvement general
                            relations.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DV1">David</persName> went into considerable detail
                            in discussing cultural exchanges past year which he said was marked by
                            “certain improvements”. Cited specifically U.S. participation Karlovy
                            Vary Film Festival and Czech participation San Francisco Film
                            Festival.</p>
                        <p>Without mentioning specific case, <persName corresp="#p_DV1"
                                >David</persName> said there had also been exchange of artists. (He
                            indicated number of U.S. artists had performed Czechoslovakia although
                            we know only of Loren Maazel during 1962.) <persName corresp="#p_DV1"
                                >David</persName> also said “agreement had been reached on
                            post-graduate exchange.” (We will follow up to determine just what he
                            referred to.) He also spoke of general scientific exchanges, including
                            technical literature, and cited increased number invitations to U.S. to
                            participate international scientific conferences in <gloss
                                target="#t_CSSR1">CSSR</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_DV1"
                                >David</persName> also stressed exchanges in field of sports, citing
                            ice hockey and soccer, international figure skating competition, Czech
                            parachutists to Boston and Dukla soccer team to U.S.</p>
                        <p>In general, he said, there have been some positive steps but relations
                            still are not satisfactory. He advocated efforts to “liquidate
                            outstanding problems and then especially to expand trade”. On trade, he
                            said that U.S. unfortunately placed hindrances in way of expansion, e.g.
                            through tariffs.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DV1">David</persName> concluded his presentation
                            with general statement that <gloss target="#t_CSSR1">CSSR</gloss>
                            desires good relations with all states, including <gloss
                                target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>. However, he said there must be certain
                            prerequisites and declared that “if Ambassador wishes to contribute to
                            achieve these, he will have our cooperation”. Only specific point he
                            mentioned this connection was need for respect <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34"
                                facs="0056"/>for normal precepts of intercourse between states,
                            concept which I later reciprocated.</p>
                        <p>Responding, I expressed appreciation <persName corresp="#p_DV1"

                            confining first call to mere courtesies. My government and I personally
                            fully shared desire see improvement relations but unfortunately there
                            was important and serious problem which we should solve in order make
                            progress possible. Referred to large number American citizens visiting
                                <gloss target="#t_CSSR1">CSSR</gloss> annually, stating that for
                            most part visits proceeded normally. We welcomed them because they
                            helped contribute to increased general understanding between our
                            peoples. However, unfortunately there had been cases in past and some
                            presently where American citizens had violated <gloss target="#t_CSSR1"
                                >CSSR</gloss> law, or were said have violated it, including cases
                            where such violation most likely innocent through lack knowledge law.

                        <p>I expressed appreciation for courteous and helpful assistance we received
                            recently in Budway case from President of Pilsen Court and defense
                            attorney. While we did not have all facts in case and had not formally
                            been given statement of charges, from our understanding of facts it
                            seemed that any violation of Czech law by Budway had not been serious,
                            although he may been imprudent. He had been sentenced four years in
                            prison and we understood he intended appeal sentence. We of course did
                            not wish inject ourselves improperly on judicial side, but I hoped
                            judicial processes would be completed quickly as possible and that they
                            would result in reduction Budway’s sentence. I expressed hope it would
                            be possible, if any sentence remained, that President Novotny—if he had
                            power to do so, which I believed was case—would commute sentence to time
                            already served. I hoped we could later discuss general question of
                            difficulties encountered by Americans and find ways to minimize
                            recurrences. I felt confident we could then make prog-ress in
                            improvement general relations, although here I believed it would have to
                            be in small steps in different fields, progressively leading to more
                            significant changes. (I purposely made no comment on his initial
                            reference to property and financial negotiations.)</p>
                        <p>Commenting on my statements on difficulties encountered by U.S. citizens
                            visiting Czechoslovakia, and on Budway case in particular, <persName
                                corresp="#p_DV1">David</persName> said Budway was serving his
                            sentence now. He said he did not <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0057"
                            />know status of appeal but, if he appealed, outcome would depend on
                            Supreme Court. He added outcome would also depend on his behavior.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DV1">David</persName> then said, referring to my
                            comment on problems of U.S. citizens having difficulty with law in
                                <gloss target="#t_CSSR1">CSSR</gloss>, that “so far as it could
                            influence U.S. citizens, it would be good if U.S. Government advised
                            them to respect and observe laws of <gloss target="#t_CSSR1"
                                >CSSR</gloss>.” He clearly indicated desire have American (and
                            other) tourists visit <gloss target="#t_CSSR1">CSSR</gloss>, stating
                                <gloss target="#t_CSSR1">CSSR</gloss> wanted them inform themselves
                            about country. If they came without hostility, they would have no
                            difficulties. Speaking of American citizens in jail in <gloss
                                target="#t_CSSR1">CSSR</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_DV1"
                                >David</persName> twice said there had been number of instances in
                            past of good will on Czech side in releasing Americans before sentence
                            served out (this was presumably reference to Shaver and Zastera cases,
                            but it was said with such emphasis that it may imply intention to
                            commute Budway’s sentence when judicial processes completed). <persName
                                corresp="#p_DV1">David</persName> added “it also is necessary that
                            the other side show good will to improve relations.” (<hi rend="italic"

                        <p>The Prime Minister welcomed me and asked about my visit to the States.
                            After my reply, <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> remarked
                            about the weather here, observing that, while the floods are serious at
                            present, he believes there will be a better crop this year. He said
                            there is an old Bulgarian saying, “The deeper the snow, the thicker the
                            bread”.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> asked me about the weather
                            in the United States. When I confirmed that we, too, have had very cold
                            weather, adding, “It’s been terribly cold all around the world”,
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> laughed and said,
                            “Yes, the weather has been cold, but the international climate has been
                            improving.”</p>
                        <p>After exchanging these pleasantries, I said I was bringing the Prime
                            Minister personal greetings from the President of the United States,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">John F. Kennedy</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Before going on, I asked <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> to
                            tell me about his recent travels; that I was interested in hearing his
                            reactions to developments in East Germany and Yugoslavia. The following
                            points were made:</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">East Germany</hi></p>
                        <p>Economic relations are more important than political. East Germany
                            occupies second place in Bulgarian foreign trade, and accounts for 12–13
                            percent of the Bulgarian total. He declared that he was impressed with
                            the “stable economy” of East Germany. He lavished such praise on “The
                            Wall” that I took sharp issue with him, and he then agreed with me that
                            we should work against walls between peoples and countries.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Yugoslavia</hi></p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> seemed a little embarrassed
                            as he began to speak about Yugoslavia. He mentioned the difference
                            between Party and Government cooperation, and clearly stated that there
                            are, and will remain, ideological differences between Bulgaria and
                            Yugoslavia as indicated in the Resolution at the Bulgarian Eighth Party
                            Congress.</p>
                        <p>However, he went on, “We are neighboring countries. We are both Socialist
                            countries. We are all of Slavic origin and the same blood. For these
                            reasons we are trying to improve relations.”</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said there have been improvements in some fields, such
                            as border questions, trade, cultural, and trade unions. But he was not
                            specific. He added, rather defensively, that this improvement should not
                            have a bearing on Yugoslav relations with other countries. <pb n="37"

                                >Zhivkov</persName> added that the ideological differences should
                            not prevent closer cooperation between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia.</p>
                        <p>I responded that I was glad to hear of this attitude, which should mean
                            that Bulgaria and the U.S. also could improve their relations. I said
                            that my Government had had a chance to review its position and was
                            anxious to settle the problems of the past so that we could move ahead
                            to positive steps towards the improvement of the relations between
                            Bulgaria and the U.S.</p>
                        <p>I added that I hoped the Bulgarian Government had also reviewed its
                            position.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Financial Claims</hi></p>
                        <p>I then raised the question of the financial claims, stating that we wish
                            to resume talks. I asked him if Bulgaria was ready to put forward a new
                            proposal.</p>
                        <p>In reply, the Prime Minister said that he was not informed on all the
                            details but, as far as he knew, an agreement had almost been reached
                            between the two governments. However, the United States Government
                            almost doubled the amount shortly before the agreement was to be
                            concluded. He asked whether, in the light of this, there was any
                            guarantee that if we reached an agreement now, the U.S. Government would
                            not again increase the amount of their claims.</p>
                        <p>I replied that, as Minister of the United States, I could assure him
                            that, if an agreement were reached here in Sofia which was approved by
                            the State Department, this agreement would be implemented and carried
                            out by the U.S. Government.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> then stated for his part he
                            would instruct Deputy Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_VP1"
                                >Voutov</persName>, and that I could instruct any Legation officer,
                            to carry on discussion on claims. He emphasized that the Bulgarian
                            Government is willing to settle this question.</p>
                        <p>I added that I hoped agreement on a lump sum cash payment could be
                            reached easily, and that technical talks concluding the agreement then
                            could be worked out in a few months.</p>
                        <p>I reminded the Prime Minister of his remark before my departure for the
                            United States to the effect that the normalization of relations with the
                            United States would be worth a great deal to Bulgaria, whether it cost
                            Bulgaria $350,000 or $10 million. <persName corresp="#p_ZT1"
                                >Zhivkov</persName> laughingly confirmed this previously stated
                            remark and repeated that it should not be difficult to reach an
                            agreement.</p>

                        <p>I then said that there is another outstanding question, the El Al claims.
                            At this point, Deputy Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_VP1"
                                >Voutov</persName> intervened before <persName corresp="#p_ZT1"
                                >Zhivkov</persName> could reply. <persName corresp="#p_VP1"
                                >Voutov</persName> said that this question was already settled; that
                            the Bulgarian Government had deposited a check in an American bank which
                            would satisfy the claims presented by the lawyers of the victims’ heirs;
                            that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DR1">Davis</persName> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VH1">Vedeler</persName> had approved the settlement; and
                            that he (<persName corresp="#p_VP1">Voutov</persName>) had a written
                            statement of acceptance by the lawyers.</p>
                        <p>I asked for clarification, stating that I did not believe the question
                            had been settled yet. The Prime Minister broke in to minimize the
                            importance of the dispute. He said that this will be clarified, that
                            there was no problem. He added that the Bulgarian Government views this
                            accident not only from the financial, but also from the humanitarian
                            point of view, and that Bulgaria is willing to meet fully all just
                            claims. He suggested that Minister <persName corresp="#p_VP1"
                                >Voutov</persName> and I discuss the problem later.<note n="2"

                        <p>I also mentioned that there is another question to be solved before we
                            can fully normalize our relations. This is a citizenship question, but
                            that, in view of the recent signs that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
                            is making some progress in the Bonev and Dorset cases, I would not go
                            into this matter today. The Prime Minister did not reply and appeared to
                            be uninformed.</p>

                        <p>The Prime Minister said that, in his view, all of these questions could
                            be solved very easily, without problems; but that the real question is:
                            What will follow the settlement of these problems?</p>
                        <p>I replied that I had had several conversations in Washington with, among
                            others, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, the
                            Secretary of State, and other officials in the Department of State and
                            that we envisage several practical steps which could be taken after the
                            settlement of the outstanding problems, such as: <list>
                                <label>a.</label>

                        <p>It was obvious that these answers did not fully satisfy Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> and that he had something else
                            on his mind.</p>
                        <p>I went on to explain that, while there is objection on the part of
                            certain Congressmen to repealing the bar to giving certain countries
                            Most Favored Nation status, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                                >Kennedy</persName> intends to request Congress to leave to his
                            discretion the application of any repeal where he thinks it would be in
                            the best interests of the United States. I added that, of course, it is
                            not possible at the present time to predict what will develop in the
                            future regarding Bulgaria. However, I said, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had assured me of his interest
                            in developing trade relations with Bulgaria and other Eastern European
                            countries.</p>

                                    >Zhivkov</persName>’s Criticism of U.S. Policy</hi></p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that the Bulgarian people are realistic and they
                            see that the Department of State’s policy towards Bulgaria was not
                            “realistic” for the past four years. The Department’s attitude would not
                            be realistic in the future, either, if it expects any changes in the
                            Bulgarian political system. “Even if I,” he said, “would like to be
                            instrumental in such changes, I would be deprived of power
                            immediately.”</p>
                        <p>Replying to my request for clarification of what he meant by
                            “unrealistic”, <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> stated
                            that, although Bulgaria is a small country, it is in the center of the
                            Balkan Peninsula and that the Balkan problems cannot be solved only with
                            the help of Greece and Turkey, and without Bulgaria.</p>
                        <p>For the past four years, he continued, there has been no improvement in
                            relations between United States and Bulgaria. Smilingly, he said, he did
                            not know whether Minister <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Voutov</persName>
                            is to be blamed for this, or whether my predecessor was at fault; that
                            my predecessor had done absolutely nothing here; that it was as if he
                            were not present in Bulgaria. At this point, I said I did not think that
                            he should criticize my predecessor who represented the United States, as
                            I am doing, and that Minister Page is a countryman of mine.</p>
                        <p>I said that I am not only the Minister of the United States, but also a
                            personal representative and friend of the President of my country. I
                            assured the Prime Minister that I was willing to cooperate with him and
                            suggested that, rather than dwelling on the past, we should make a new
                            start in relations between our two countries by the two of us working
                            together.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> replied that he does not
                            wish to dwell on the past, but to learn from it.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Trade Proposal</hi></p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then said that Bulgaria is very much interested in
                            developing trade with the United States. If favorable terms can be
                            arranged, <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0062"/>he said, Bulgaria is
                            desirous now of purchasing from the U.S. one or two chemical factories.
                            Bulgaria has already received three offers from other countries, one
                            being very favorable, he said, implying that Bulgaria is not dependent
                            on the United States for purchasing chemical works, since it is able to
                            obtain them from other countries, such as West Germany, France and even
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>He said that, if there should be any difficulties in selling such
                            chemical factories directly to Bulgaria, this could be overcome through
                            an un-named third country. I did not reply to this extraordinary
                            suggestion. Indeed, <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> rushed
                            on to the next subject, not appearing much interested in whether or not
                            I responded.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> then raised the subject of

                            on January 31 (Legtel 322)<note n="3" xml:id="d18fn3">Dated February 1.
                                (Ibid., Edu 7)</note> in which I had expressed my displeasure over
                            derogatory cartoons and press attacks on President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I reiterated that the attacks against the United States Government, and
                            even President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, which
                            appear in the press, and caricatures of the President which are
                            displayed certainly do not contribute to the improvement of relations
                            between our two countries. I said that I, as personal representative of
                            the President, consider such attacks and pictures as personally
                            offensive. I added that President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                                >Kennedy</persName> is devoted to peace and wishes Bulgaria no harm,
                            only good.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister pointed out that our two countries live under
                            different systems and that, also, the American press is critical of
                            Communist regimes.</p>
                        <p>I explained that the American press is not controlled by our Government
                            and, furthermore, what I had in mind is not the criticism of ideologies,
                            or systems, but concrete attacks against the U.S. Government, and even
                            the head of our Government.</p>
                        <p>“The American press,” I added, “has not been critical of you, Mr. Prime
                            Minister. On the contrary, I have read in the American press some very
                            complimentary remarks about you.”</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then said that he agreed with me; that he is not now
                            aware of concrete facts to which I have referred but he deplores them.
                            He assured me that, today, he would issue appropriate instructions that
                            such attacks should not be repeated.</p>
                        <p>Then <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> added that, shortly
                            after his appointment as Prime Minister, personal derogatory remarks
                            about him had appeared in some “Western press”, not naming the exact
                            source. He said he had <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0063"/>thought of
                            asking the Foreign Office to call the Chief of Mission of that
                            particular country here in Sofia and to draw his attention to these
                            press remarks, but since these attacks had soon stopped he thought
                            action would no longer be justified.</p>
                        <p>Our meeting, which lasted for one hour and fifteen minutes, ended on a
                            cordial note. Toasts were exchanged to the further development of better
                            relations between our two countries, with the Prime Minister adding his
                            hope that considerable progress will be achieved before our next
                            meeting. As I was leaving the room, I admired the bouquet of roses on
                            the table. Minister <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Voutov</persName>
                            selected the nicest one and handed it to <persName corresp="#p_ZT1"
                                >Zhivkov</persName> who presented it to me.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Comments</hi></p>
                        <p>I had the impression that <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName>
                            was less buoyant than at the time of our first meeting.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d18fn4">See <ref target="#d16">Document 16</ref>.</note>
                            Probably his first two months as Prime Minister have been a strain, in
                            spite of his allegations that things have been going well here.
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> also may have felt
                            less confident in my presence when confronted with specific issues, than
                            on the occasion of our first meeting when he could confine himself to
                            generalities.</p>
                        <p>I was struck again, as during our first visit, by <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName>’s reference to Bulgaria being a
                            small country, and his repeated complaint that Bulgaria has felt ignored
                            by the U.S. I was surprised that he stated so clearly that Bulgaria has
                            no choice over its Soviet alignment.</p>
                        <p>I noted that Minister <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Voutov</persName> took a
                            harder position than <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName>
                            whenever the former entered the conversation. I also observed that
                                <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Voutov</persName>’s smile frequently
                            turned into a smirk, and felt that he was trying to impress me and the
                            Prime Minister that he will be a tough bargainer. However, I believe
                            that <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Voutov</persName> has a great deal at
                            stake in reaching agreement with the U.S. now and that <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> has committed himself to do
                            so.</p>

                        <p>The President began by asking the new Bulgarian Minister, <persName
                                corresp="#p_PL1">Lyubomir Dimitrov Popov</persName>, what were the
                            principal problems in US-Bulgarian relations. The Minister responded by
                            saying “trade”, pointing out lack of <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>
                            which made the difference on duties very high. For instance, Bulgarian
                            tobacco had to pay a duty of 35 compared to a competitor with <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> who paid only 12. In response to the
                            President’s question, the Minister said Bulgaria was interested in
                            buying engineering products, particularly manufacturing plants. The
                            Minister said they were encouraged by the recent agreement in principle
                            to complete a financial claims settlement and hoped that with the
                            establishment of a Trade Office in New York some progress could be made
                            in developing US-Bulgarian trade.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that the Minister was undoubtedly familiar with
                            the Congressional action taken last year in denying <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> to Poland and Yugoslavia. The President
                            expressed the opinion that it was unlikely that in the present state of
                            international relations the Congress would consider restoring <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> to those countries who do not now enjoy
                            it.</p>
                        <p>In a brief discussion of economic relationships in the Bloc, the Minister
                            said that Bulgaria’s foreign trade with the Western nations is about 20%
                            of the total whereas with the USSR it is 50%; a great portion of
                            Bulgaria’s exports consisted of agricultural products, especially
                            tomatoes and grapes. The USSR represented a vast market for Bulgaria,
                            although his country was still relatively under-developed.</p>
                        <p>The President asked the Minister how long he had been a Communist. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PL1">Popov</persName> replied that his father
                            had been killed as a Communist in <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0065"
                            />1923 in an anti-Fascist revolt in Bulgaria and that he had been
                            brought up as a Communist. Bulgaria had by tradition and history had
                            close relations with Moscow. The Russians had liberated Bulgaria from
                            five centuries’ rule under the Turks. Marxist Socialism had always had a
                            strong appeal in Bulgaria and Dimitrov had been the Bulgarian hero of
                            the workers movement.</p>
                        <p>The President asked if the Chinese were active in Eastern Europe and why
                            the present situation existed in Albania. The Minister replied that the
                            Albanians had a young and immature leadership; their relations with
                            Greece were bad and indeed a state of war still theoretically existed.
                            Albania feels itself surrounded by enemies. These, in his opinion, were
                            the principal reasons for the Albanian position.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked about the Sino-Soviet dispute and whether its
                            origins lay in ideology or in history. The Minister replied he really
                            did not understand the present situation and did not know much about it.
                            He expressed the personal opinion that the rift reflected “nationalism”,
                            the isolation of China and the size of its population.</p>
                        <p>The Minister then briefly sketched the history of the Bulgarian Communist
                            Party under the leadership of Dimitrov, using this to conclude that
                            Western political leaders erred in the view that the Communists were
                            always monolithic; there had always been disputes and disagreements in
                            the Communist movement.</p>
                        <p>The discussion was terminated with the President wishing the Minister
                            well in his mission in Washington.</p>

                                    established course of building up its industry, and that the
                                    Summit meeting confirmed that no decisions can be taken by CEMA
                                    without unanimous approval of all members and that nothing can
                                    be done there contrary to the desires and interests of any

                                    referred to newspaper reports here over recent months of
                                    evidence of a more independent Rumanian position and spirit
                                    vis-à-vis Moscow both with regard to CEMA and to Sino-Soviet
                                    differences, and noted that the Rumanians had returned their
                                    Ambassador to Albania, contrary to the action of other Bloc
                                    countries. He said that these signs of an independent spirit met
                                    with an approving reaction on the part of the American people
                                    and that in this atmosphere it might be possible to be more
                                    receptive to Rumanian requests for more trade and to Rumanian
                                    needs for industrial installations to which Mr.

                                    isoprene installation. Both of these had been included in the

                                    They would only be intended for wholly peaceful uses, and if

                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> repeated that
                            the Rumanian show of independence toward Moscow created a better
                            atmosphere for considering improved economic relations and that Mr.
                                <persName>Gheorghiu-Dej</persName>’s proposals would be carefully
                            studied. He warned that action on such matters may take time but assured
                            Mr. <persName>Malita</persName> that he would look further into the
                            entire question. As for the desired industrial installations, there were
                            really two aspects of the subject, those of licensing and financing.
                            Minister Crawford explained some aspects of the Rumanian financing
                            procedures in comparable deals with Western European firms which have
                            sold Rumania some $350–$400 million worth of industrial installations
                            over the past three years. Mr. <persName>Malita</persName> made the
                            personal suggestion that a US-Rumanian joint study group on trade
                            expansion might be usefully set up at this juncture. Governor <persName

                            consider raising status of our mission at Budapest. US has special
                            problems in its relations with Hungary which will require some time to
                            solve or to make definite progress towards solution before question of
                            elevating mission of practical significance. In any event we anticipate
                            that it would be necessary after solution of some of these problems and
                            as reflection of progress in regularization of relations to send
                            Minister to Budapest before elevating mission. Thus US may be obliged to
                            hold back on this step in Hungary when other Western governments are
                            preparing to go ahead. If they agree time is favorable for doing so, US
                            cannot ask them to wait for US action.</p>
                        <p>US prepared to elevate missions at Bucharest and Sofia at appropriate
                            time. We think it advisable as means reinforce the importance and effect

                            and France to move about the same time in raising status of missions in
                            Rumania and Bulgaria.</p>
                        <p>Apart from factor of international atmosphere which now appears favorable
                            for this step believe two principal considerations relevant in
                            determining time of such action: (1) progress in solution of bilateral
                            problems and in expansion of bilateral relations; and (2) extent to
                            which EE country asserting more independent position toward Soviet
                            Union. On these bases missions at Bucharest should be elevated before
                            those at Sofia and US expects to take this step first at Bucharest. It
                            is hoped <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France might agree.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless we are not ready to move yet at Bucharest. Consider it
                            necessary before this step taken at either Bucharest or Sofia to make
                            further progress in solution of outstanding bilateral problems. These
                            include problems of dual nationals, separated families, accommodations
                            (chancery buildings at Bucharest and Sofia, residence site of CM and
                            housing at Sofia) and consular convention. We expect to make progress in
                            solution these problems at Bucharest as our economic relations with
                            Rumania develop over the next months. We cannot forecast any definite
                            schedule of progress but would hope to be in position possibly within a
                            year to arrange with Rumanians mutual elevation of missions. The step
                            with Sofia would come some time thereafter.</p>
                        <p>We propose that the three governments consult in the future with a view
                            to acting in concert concerning the rank of their missions at Bucharest
                            and Sofia. The subject should also be raised in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                        <p>Following the opening amenities, the Secretary made reference to the
                            recent steps made toward the improvement of U.S.-Bulgarian relations and
                            expressed the U.S. desire to work for further improvements.</p>
                        <p>In response to this, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BK1"
                                >Bashev</persName> expressed his agreement but noted that in regard
                            to the recently concluded Claims Agreement<note n="1" xml:id="d22fn1"
                                >For text of the U.S.-Bulgarian agreement and accompanying

                            Government had made quite a few concessions which they felt were
                            justified by the desire to improve U.S.-Bulgarian relations in the
                            future. <persName corresp="#p_BK1">Bashev</persName> made favorable
                            reference to the joint declaration made at the time when the Claims
                            Agreement was completed. He expressed regret, however, that he could not
                            describe present U.S.-Bulgarian commercial relations as satisfactory. He
                            noted Bulgarian readiness to buy a number of U.S. products, mentioning
                            factories for cigarettes and artificial fibers, plus cotton, grain,
                            fodder and paper. He said, however, that Bulgaria wants the same price
                            conditions as other countries, needs more expeditious action on U.S.
                            export licenses, needs better tariff treatment on its exports, and wants
                            credit arrangements similar to those available from West Germany,
                            France, Italy and Japan.</p>
                        <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0070"/>
                        <p>The Secretary replied by enumerating the various problems which impede
                            development of U.S.-Bulgarian trade relations noting U.S. legislation on
                            strategic goods, extension of credit, and most-favored nation treatment,
                            on which latter question favorable Congressional action towards Eastern
                            European countries other than Yugoslavia and Poland is not likely this
                            year. The Secretary expressed hope that some steps could be undertaken
                            on the problems within the purview of the Executive Branch and mentioned
                            a review of export licensing policy, a desire to examine more closely
                            what Bulgarian products can be marketed in the United States, and the
                            need to reach agreement on trade practices such as those involving
                            patents and copyrights and dumping. He observed that in an improving
                            international atmosphere involving U.S.-Bulgarian relations as well,
                            American consumers would be more receptive to Bulgarian products and
                            American businessmen more anxious to sell to Bulgaria. He also observed
                            that greater travel would contribute to improving this atmosphere and
                            observed that the United States is interested in having more Bulgarian
                            tourists as well as seeing more Americans travel to Bulgaria. He said
                            that the conclusion of an agreement on travel of dual nationals similar
                            to that recently concluded between the United States and Czechoslovakia
                            would encourage more Americans of Bulgarian origin to travel to
                            Bulgaria.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BK1">Bashev</persName>, commenting on the
                            Secretary’s remarks, observed that there would be no problem of dumping
                            from Bulgaria and that his country was a signatory of the international
                            agreement on patents and copyrights. He welcomed the Secretary’s
                            suggestion that some steps to improve trade could be pursued even prior
                            to any changes in U.S. legislation and stated that he would like to be
                            able to say to his government that a decision had been reached to start
                            negotiations soon on this matter.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that for reasons of timing in relations with the
                            committees of Congress, the United States would prefer to have a
                            preliminary stage of discussions and examination of the trade problem
                            before entering into a stage of actual negotiations.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BK1">Bashev</persName> agreed to this approach and
                            then commented on the question of tourism, noting that Bulgarian tourism
                            to the United States was obstructed by the lack of a direct air route
                            and the shortage of hard currency which the Bulgarian Government could
                            afford to earmark for tourism.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that, although we were desirous of an increase of
                            Bulgarian tourism to the United States, we recognized that there would
                            be an imbalance in tourism but that this would perhaps help Bulgaria to
                            acquire currency with which to cover its imports from the United
                            States.</p>
                        <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0071"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BK1">Bashev</persName> replied that the question of
                            dual citizenship could easily be resolved on the basis of a treaty and
                            that Bulgaria had no problem in this connection.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary concluded by mentioning he expected shortly there would be
                            some important decision on the question of sale of U.S. grain to the
                            Eastern European countries and that he hoped to be in touch with the
                            Minister when this decision was reached. He noted that the sale of grain
                            would be a good point to begin the exchange of U.S.-Bulgarian trade
                            since the American public has a more receptive attitude toward trade in
                            food commodities with the socialist countries than it does with trade in
                            some other commodities.</p>

                        <p>Following discussion of some of the broader problems in East-West
                            relations, the conversation turned to US-Rumanian bilateral relations.
                            The Secretary expressed the hope that we could find points at which our
                            relations could develop. He said that we were exploring trade
                            possibilities at present and had already taken certain administrative
                            actions in <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0072"/>this connection. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> replied that he did
                            not wish to give the appearance of hurrying things but would like to
                            express the views of his government as to specific ways in which our
                            relations could be improved.</p>

                                    <persName corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> said that “the
                                game had been interrupted by the U.S., and the ball was now in your
                                hands”. The Secretary said he accepted the fact that the ball was in
                                our court and hoped we could furnish our answer soon to their recent
                                note on this subject. He also hoped that the Rumanians would have a
                                sophisticated understanding of the position we must take on travel,
                                which is greatly influenced by the fact that the US constitutes the
                                great heartland of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defensive
                                strength.</item>

                                Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> thought that it
                                would contribute to the extension of our relations to raise the
                                level of our respective missions. He understood it was necessary for
                                us to “take into account other countries—your friends, as well as
                                our friends”. The Secretary replied that we had no fixed views on
                                this matter and did not exclude the possibility of raising the level
                                of our missions. We were giving active consideration to the
                                question. He also indicated that any action we might take would not
                                be subject to the veto of our allies.</item>

                            <item><hi rend="italic">Economic Relations</hi>. Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> pointed out that certain
                                difficulties with regard to Rumania’s desire to broaden its trade
                                relations with the US still existed. Referring specifically to the
                                recent approval of an export license submitted by a US firm in

                                that there were some steps which we could take administratively.
                                Other steps would require legislative action, however, and he could
                                offer no encouragement in that regard in the near future. He agreed
                                there was room for improvement of our trade relations and expressed
                                the desire for progress in this field. Mr. <persName

                        <p>The President referred to the severe limitations on travel in the Soviet
                            Union and said the United States is concerned that so much has been
                            invested in its security that it was now necessary to establish travel
                            controls. These are essential to our standard of security. They are not
                            a harassment of Czechoslovak officials and are not directed against
                            Czechoslovakia. They are not a political act but are simple security <pb
                                n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0076"/>measures. He understood the
                            Ambassador’s concern and said we do not wish to maintain these measures
                            as a permanent thing. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_DK1">Duda</persName>
                            replied that the problem here is that measures of this sort are followed
                            by corresponding measures which tend to complicate relations.</p>
                        <p>On the question of trade, the President agreed that it would be difficult
                            to expect Czechoslovakia and other Eastern European countries to buy
                            more in the United States unless they were at the same time able to sell
                            more here. He then referred to the limitations regarding <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> and to the recent Senatorial
                            discussions concerning this subject. The President said he would be glad
                            to see this situation changed and trade be kept out of the political
                            arena. However, he believes that if relations improve, and he hopes they
                            will, this problem may be solved.</p>
                        <p>He was aware, the President said, that Czechoslovakia has taken certain
                            steps to improve relations. He believes it useful to all to maintain
                            normal relations. He hoped, therefore, that our relations would improve
                            further during the course of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_DK1"
                                >Duda</persName>’s assignment. Certainly, he said, the desire to
                            improve relations is as strong as it has been for a long time. However,
                            the President added, the recent Soviet arrest of Professor

                            difficult for the United States. Temperatures tend to rise over
                            incidents of this nature, but, he continued, we must persist in our
                            efforts to attain normal relations.</p>
                        <p>With respect to his own country, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_DK1"
                                >Duda</persName> said problems existed but he believes the situation
                            there is improving. He noted that Czechoslovakia has concluded a
                            contract to purchase grain in Canada and a Czechoslovak official is
                            currently in New York negotiating the purchase of corn, rice and 250,000
                            tons of wheat.</p>
                        <p>The President said he hoped the grain purchases go along well and asked
                            the Ambassador to come back anytime.</p>

                                <item>Rumanians desired import industrial installations from US in
                                    such fields as chemicals, rubber, power, metallurgy,
                                    electro-technology, cellulose, food products. Although now
                                    buying some of these products elsewhere in West, RPR wanted to
                                    achieve balanced commercial relations with other nations. Hoped
                                    obtain equally good or better equipment than that now being

                                    of interest to US. RPR realizes this is difficult since US could
                                    not absorb all potential categories Rumanian exports and high US

                        <p>Gaston-Marin said RPR hopes in further talks to establish a framework of
                            understanding on these points.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> replied in substance that
                            we were planning invite Gaston-Marin for discussion these topics but
                            that we not yet ready make definite policy commitments. US has recently
                            issued certain export licenses as indication of a degree of
                            liberalization of export control policy in response to RPR assertions
                            self-interest. Referred specifically to Galati decision. Could not
                            comment at this time on large number of US industrial installations RPR
                            desires purchase from US. Since US does not engage in state trading, RPR
                            would have to explore its export possibilities through private firms. Re
                            credit terms, referred to pending Mundt bill which would pose
                            difficulties if passed but which Administration hoped would be defeated
                            as it since then has been.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> emphasized in general
                            discussion that US objective was to encourage Rumanian development for
                            benefit of Rumanian people. Although US did not desire RPR to have other
                            than friendly relations with its neighbor USSR, past US-Rumanian
                            difficulties in large measure <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0078"
                            />attributable to feeling in US that Rumania subject to Moscow dictates.
                            US also desired insure that equipment and technology exported to Rumania
                            would not be made available to USSR. <persName>Gaston-Marin</persName>
                            replied that Governor had not seen Rumania since 1946 and much had since
                            been accomplished to the benefit of Rumanian people. In addition, state
                            policy of Rumania is to honor strictly all commitments made re
                            protection of patents and industrial information.</p>
                        <p>At <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>’s suggestion,

                        <p>370. We believe Hungarian success in parleying Western legations to
                            embassies here calls for stocktaking on what we may now expect from
                            Hungarians ourselves.</p>
                        <p>This is what our diplomatic colleagues tell us here. Around time Greeks
                            raised their legation this summer Hungarians approached Belgians.
                            Brussels responded affirmatively and now announcement expected shortly.
                            Hungarians reportedly maneuvered timing of Belgian announcement over
                            several months in order encourage recent British action. At about time
                            British action appeared likely, Hungarians approached French. French
                            action now expected December 17. Meanwhile, Hungarians have approached
                            Italians and suggested to Austrians that property negotiations might be
                            facilitated by Austria raising its legation. Hungarians also indicated
                            to American press representative <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0079"

                            US-Hungarian relations.</p>
                        <p>While this successful maneuvering of Hungarians does West little credit
                            at least some Western missions here were ripe for such approaches. In
                            contrast to ourselves, most of them did not have outstanding problems
                            requiring solution before taking such action. Some did not want to be
                            held back by our special problems and some felt that we have been
                            unnecessarily slow in getting at our problems.</p>
                        <p>We may be sure <gloss target="#t_GOH1">GOH</gloss> has sensed this and
                            may feel that action of other Western powers will tend to isolate us in
                            our posture toward Hungary. They are likely to seek exploit this
                            difference and use it to bring pressure on us to give Hungary the stamp
                            of respectability that other Western powers now giving. <gloss
                                target="#t_GOH1">GOH</gloss> probably was much, if not more,
                            interested in acquiring that stamp of respectability as solving
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>In such situation <gloss target="#t_GOH1">GOH</gloss> should not be
                            allowed to hang on us responsibility for not moving effectively toward
                            solution our outstanding problems. Rightly or wrongly, as UN issue has
                            receded, problem of Cardinal, about which everyone here speaks in hushed
                            tones, has emerged within last year in minds Hungarians and diplomatic
                            community as central US-Hungarian problem, solution of which could lead
                            to progress in other areas. This unfortunately tends obscure
                            constructive steps on which <gloss target="#t_GOH1">GOH</gloss> gives us
                            little credit, that we have taken in UN, on wheat, and elsewhere. We
                            very much need avoid this and stress positive side what we are doing
                            vis-à-vis Hungary. Information media can play key role in this.
                            Indoctrination our allies and neutrals may also be called for.</p>

                            to Hungary on December 17 at the close of the 18th <gloss

                            the Hungarian Delegation to the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. He
                            stated that he wished to take advantage of a “courtesy call” before his
                            departure to continue discussions that had begun with Governor <persName
                                corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> at the time of President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>’s funeral but which
                            had been interrupted when <persName corresp="#p_MP1">Mod</persName> had
                            to return to New York.<note n="1" xml:id="d28fn1">No record of these
                                discussions has been found.</note></p>
                        <p>After initial amenities, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MP1">Mod</persName>
                            said that he would like to take the opportunity, now that he was in
                            Washington, to talk further with Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1"
                                >Harriman</persName> about relations between Hungary and the United
                            States. Although he did not know in detail the daily matters of concern
                            between the two countries, he knew the general feeling in the Foreign
                            Ministry. Relations between Hungary and the US, he continued, had
                            recently developed in a good way. The relation of the two countries’ UN
                            delegations were more normal. During the recent visit to the US of the
                            Hungarian First Deputy Minister of Agriculture, <persName>Janos
                                Hont</persName>, Hungary saw with some satisfaction the good will
                            towards that visit on the part of the US Administration and its helpful
                            attitude. In the matter of the wheat and corn purchases, the US
                            Government also gave evidence of helpfulness and good will.</p>
                        <p>On Hungary’s part, continued Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MP1"
                                >Mod</persName>, there had also been signs of improvement. Travel
                            restrictions had been abolished in Hungary. He <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59"
                                facs="0081"/>had recently noted with pleasure that the US Charge had
                            called on the Hungarian Foreign Minister in Budapest.<note n="2"

                            his personal feeling that this atmosphere now made it appropriate to
                            talk about the development of US-Hungarian relations.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> noted that the
                            US Charge in Budapest had been talking over, with the Hungarian Foreign
                            Office, various matters which the US thought would assist in the
                            improvement of US-Hungarian relations. Certain useful steps had already
                            been taken, Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>
                            continued, but other further steps remain to be taken. These steps,
                            which the US Charge was authorized to discuss with the Hungarian Foreign
                            Office, were the same ones outlined to <persName>Charge
                                Radvanyi</persName> in Washington on October 20, 1962<note n="3"

                            The subjects include the problem of dual nationals, the separation of
                            families, and the ability of American citizens to see their families in
                            Hungary. While there had been a decided improvement in travel to and
                            from Hungary recently, certain members of the families of American
                            citizens still remain in Hungary separated from their relatives. There
                            was also the question of the size of the US mission in Budapest and the
                            restrictions on its personnel. Other problems were the claims relating
                            to US Government property in Budapest, as well as the post-war claims of
                            private American citizens which have already been settled in most
                            Eastern European countries.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> added that he
                            had told Mr. <persName>Kadar</persName> in Moscow<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d28fn4"><persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>’s
                                July 15–25 visit to the Soviet Union concluded with an agreement on
                                the text of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. No record of this
                                conversation has been found.</note> that, although it was not
                            directly a bilateral issue, the question of Cardinal Mindszenty would be
                            an important one in the improvement of US-Hungarian relations. A problem
                            that the Hungarian Government wanted settled, on the other hand, related
                            to Hungary’s desire to sell meat to the US so that Hungary might expand
                            its trade. This involved inspection procedures to satisfy US sanitary
                            standards. The US had rather strict rules on the standards of meat
                            production, which applied all over the world, not just to Hungary. The
                            US had worked this problem out with Poland, and some progress, Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> understood, had been
                            made in this matter with Hungary. The major point was that certain steps
                            should be taken: the specific steps should be discussed in Budapest with
                            the US charge.</p>
                        <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0082"/>
                        <p>The subject of claims, said Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1"
                                >Harriman</persName>, had not yet been under active discussion
                            between the US and Hungary. The US had property in Hungary which it
                            wanted to rehabilitate, but first the Hungarian squatters who presently
                            occupied the premises must be moved out. To make these properties
                            available to the US the cooperation of the Hungarian authorities was
                            necessary. The US felt that these foregoing points were very important
                            and action should be taken on them if relations between the two
                            countries were to make progress. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MP1"
                                >Mod</persName> agreed that certain points were very important.</p>
                        <p>The US, continued Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1"
                                >Harriman</persName>, had watched and was watching with interest
                            various liberalization steps that Hungary had taken, including the
                            general amnesty of March 1963. This was encouraging to the US. The US
                            was of course interested in the development of US-Hungarian relations,
                            and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MP1">Mod</persName> could repeat to his
                            Ministry in Budapest that the American charge in Budapest was fully
                            authorized to discuss these matters. Governor <persName
                                corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> concluded that the question of
                            Cardinal Mindszenty had come up quite informally in Moscow in his
                            discussions with Premier Kadar (during the negotiating and signing of
                            the Partial Test Ban Agreement).</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MP1">Mod</persName> said that as in Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>’s discussions with
                            Premier Kadar, the position of the Hungarian Government with regard to
                            Cardinal Mindszenty was clear. The problem of Cardinal Mindszenty, as
                            well as other Church-State matters, was the subject of negotiations
                            between Hungary and the Vatican. These negotiations were proceeding in a
                            good atmosphere, and he thought that some time in the near future the
                            problem of the Cardinal, as well as the other Church-State problems,
                            would be settled.</p>
                        <p>As to the normalization of relations between the US and Hungary, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MP1">Mod</persName> continued, the questions
                            connected with the person of the Cardinal could be settled. All pending
                            questions could be settled by direct negotiations, even the question of
                            claims, if approached within the framework of the general problem of
                            commercial and economic relations between the US and Hungary. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MP1">Mod</persName> said he felt it necessary
                            for the US and Hungary to sit down and talk over the claims problem. As
                            to diplomatic relations, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MP1">Mod</persName>
                            noted that the US must surely be aware that all its allies in Western
                            Europe were raising their missions in Budapest to the level of
                            embassies. It seemed to him, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MP1"
                                >Mod</persName>, that the US was not in accord with the general
                            diplomatic situation in Budapest, because the diplomatic establishment
                            maintained by the US was of third rank, being headed not by an
                            Ambassador or Minister but by a charge. In conclusion, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MP1">Mod</persName> doubted that this situation was very
                            satisfactory even for the US.</p>
                        <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0083"/>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> pointed out that
                            the US had its own special problems with Hungary, some of which he had
                            just mentioned. Additionally, in its relations with Hungary the US had
                            historically been influenced by the especially friendly feelings of the
                            American people for the Hungarian people. So many Hungarians had
                            emigrated to the US, there was perhaps a more personal feeling for the
                            welfare of the Hungarian people in the US than in other Western
                            countries for historical and other reasons. The first problem that had
                            to be solved, Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>
                            said, was the normalization of US-Hungarian relations. The raising of
                            the US Legation in Budapest to an Embassy must remain a matter for
                            future developments. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1"
                                >Harriman</persName> pointed out that the US had legations in
                            Bulgaria and Rumania, and embassies in Poland and Czechoslovakia. US
                            relations with Poland had improved steadily, and the US has done a great
                            deal for Poland, particularly with regard to supplying food. It was
                            necessary only to refer to the case of Poland to understand how
                            relations between the other Eastern European governments could be
                            developed with the US, if those countries were of a mind to do so. To
                            develop such a relationship required give, as well as take, on the part
                            of the Hungarian Government. The US was glad to note the prog-ress that
                            Hungary had made, continued Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1"
                                >Harriman</persName>, but further steps still needed to be taken by
                            that Government. The US was certainly interested in contributing to the
                            improvement of US-Hungarian relations, and Governor <persName
                                corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> added that he was very glad
                            for the opportunity to talk over the matter of relations with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MP1">Mod</persName>. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MP1">Mod</persName> added that Hungary, too, was
                            interested in better relations and was prepared to discuss the
                            subject.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VH1">Vedeler</persName> said that the basic
                            points on which the US feels improvement of relations with Hungary
                            depends were still those outlined to charge <persName corresp="#p_RJ1"
                                >Radvanyi</persName> on October 20, 1962 by Deputy Assistant
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DR1">Davis</persName>. Both in Budapest
                            and Washington, discussions between the two Governments on this subject
                            had followed the outlines of the October 20 discussion. These points
                            were embodied in a “talking paper”, a copy of which was informally
                            provided Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> at the time
                            of that discussion.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> asked Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MP1">Mod</persName> if there had been anything
                            in the recent <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> Session which had
                            seemed of special importance to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MP1"
                                >Mod</persName> at the time. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MP1"
                                >Mod</persName> answered that the most important fact was the
                            absence of the Hungarian question from the agenda of the 18th <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> session. Governor <persName
                                corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MP1">Mod</persName> had undoubtedly noticed the US
                            position on that question, and the fact that the US has decided to move
                            ahead. He added that he thought Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MP1"
                                >Mod</persName> should tell the Foreign Ministry why the US asked
                            more of Hungary. The American people had strong feelings for the
                            Hungarian people. America was made up of people from all countries in
                            East and West Europe. As Ambassador <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62"
                                facs="0084"/>to Moscow during World War II, Governor <persName
                                corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said he had addressed himself
                            more to the subject of the future status of Poland than to any other
                            subject: Poland was a symbol to the American people. The US also had
                            special feelings for the people of Hungary, which reflected the way the
                            US people felt towards US relations with Eastern Europe.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MP1">Mod</persName> said that the Hungarian
                            Government knew the obstacles in the way of bettering relations, and he
                            thought that these obstacles were now largely removed.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> mentioned that
                            US relations with Yugoslavia were of a special nature, a fact stemming
                            basically from Yugoslavia’s independence of outside domination. Ever
                            since the time of President Wilson, the US had been particularly strong
                            for the self-determination and independence of peoples from outside
                            domination. It appeared to be a policy on the part of the Kremlin to
                            favor more self-determination in Eastern Europe. On this question
                            Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had recently
                            said that when the child grows, he becomes harder to control. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> in his speech at
                            American University on June 10, 1963,<note n="5" xml:id="d28fn5">For

                            important things to say on this subject. Chairman <persName

                            speech since the time of President Roosevelt. The speech had been very
                            fundamental, and very frank, and Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1"
                                >Harriman</persName> hoped that we would go down the road to which
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had pointed at
                            that time. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MP1">Mod</persName> said he was
                            convinced that this speech had been understood correctly all over the
                            world, and that what he was talking about, namely the improvement of
                            US-Hungarian relations, was in line with that speech.</p>
                        <p>The meeting then closed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MP1">Mod</persName>
                            agreed to Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>’s
                            proposal that the press be informed merely that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MP1">Mod</persName> had paid a courtesy call, and
                            discussions of mutual interest which had been broached at the time of
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>’s funeral were
                            continued during this second meeting.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DR1">Davis</persName> opened the conversation
                            saying he imagined Minister <persName corresp="#p_PL1">Popov</persName>
                            knew, either from his own sources or from the radio, what the subject
                            was to be. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DR1">Davis</persName> continued
                            saying he was under instructions to protest strongly the mob attack on
                            our Legation in Sofia and the failure to provide prompt and adequate
                            police protection. We hold the Bulgarian Government fully responsible
                            and will expect either restoration or compensation for the damaged
                            property, both government and privately-owned. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR1">Davis</persName> mentioned he was also surprised at
                            the delay in bringing up militia reinforcements, particularly since he
                            understood that the militiaman at the entrance to the Legation had a
                            telephone at his disposal.</p>
                        <p>Continuing, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DR1">Davis</persName> said that we
                            expect the Bulgarian authorities will take immediate and effective
                            action to assure the safety of the lives of official American personnel
                            and the security of US property. We object also to the fact there was
                            nearly a six-hour delay in the arrangement of an appointment for our

                            spontaneous and had been brought under control as soon as the Bulgarian
                            authorities were aware of it. He said the occurrence was unfortunate and
                            that he had every wish to keep our relations moving forward. When he
                            again described the demonstration as spontaneous, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR1">Davis</persName> reminded him that he had used no
                            adjective to modify the word demonstration. Apparently very anxious to
                            leave a rather embarrassing subject, Minister <persName corresp="#p_PL1"
                                >Popov</persName> concluded saying that he would relay our protest
                            immediately to his Government. Before leaving, Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_PL1">Popov</persName> then asked a technical question
                            concerning the <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> provision in the
                            Foreign Assistance Act of 1963.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> informed the Ambassador
                            that President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> had in
                            principle approved the proposed $5 million credit to Poland, subject,
                            however, to review by the new Administration. The reason for this, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> stated, was that
                            subsequent to the Ambassador’s last call in the Department, we have
                            received reliable reports that Poland is offering long term credits to
                            Cuba at aid-type interest rates. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1"
                                >Kohler</persName> called attention to the provision of the Mutual
                            Security Appropriation Act of 1961 (Section 110)<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d31fn1">For text of this act, P.L. 86–794, approved
                                September 2, 1960, see 74 Stat. 776. Section 110 forbade U.S. aid to
                                a government that provided economic or military assistance to the
                                “Castro regime” unless the President determined that the withholding
                                of such aid would be contrary to U.S. national interest.</note>
                            which bars the use of funds appropriated under the Act to any country
                            that provides economic and military aid to the Castro regime. A problem
                            has therefore arisen with respect to the proposed US credit to Poland
                            and we require all facts regarding the reported Polish credit offer to
                            Cuba. Specifically, it is necessary for us to know a) whether the
                            reported credit offer is correct; b) if correct, whether the offer has
                            been accepted; and c) if accepted, the volume and intended utilization
                            of the credit. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> pointed
                            out that it was fair to say that the policy established under the law
                            contemplated that we would not give help to other countries in order
                            that they in turn might aid the Castro regime.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador stated that he had some information on the matter but
                            preferred to seek full facts and instructions from Warsaw. He felt it
                            necessary, however, to express regret that Polish relations with Cuba
                            were being linked to a credit from the US to Poland.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> pointed to the
                            requirement of the law which has been well-known to the Polish Embassy
                            and, we assume, to the Polish Government. Speaking personally, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> stated that he could
                            not understand how Polish involvement in Cuba could serve Polish
                            interests. <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0089"/>Poland had no real
                            commercial interests in Cuba and its aid offers to Cuba would be
                            regarded as obviously politically-motivated and as unfriendly acts
                            towards the US. The Ambassador commented that the volume of Polish-Cuban
                            trade was very small and should not stand in the way of US-Polish
                            relations. At the same time, he realized that the Cuban issue was
                            charged with emotion in the US and unwarranted conclusions could be
                            drawn with respect to transactions which the Polish Government regards
                            as normal from a commercial viewpoint.</p>

                            According to Gottesman US should have made available in 1957–58 block
                            credit of 300 million–350 million for Poland’s immediate use, either for
                            agricultural products or capital equipment as regime saw fit. This of
                            course was impractical and probably would not have brought us much more
                            recognition in public eye since regime’s will to accord us such public
                            credit has been notably lacking. Especially in past year there has been

                            assistance we are not asking for appreciation but merely actual
                            recognition. Allusion might be made to pressing world food shortages,
                            necessity PL480 priorities under expanding food for peace program and
                            possibility that US agricultural resources might be utilized to better
                            advantage elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps not as sticking point but as leverage in negotiations we would
                            like to reiterate proposal to reduce grace repayment period on any new
                            PL480 agreement to 3 or 5 years in order to stimulate Polish planning
                            and interest in agreeing promptly to projects to be financed by local
                            currency as and when Battle Act amended. In this regard we note Poles
                            agreed to 5 year grace period previous agreements, that extention to 10
                            years granted 1960 was designed ease balance of payments in relation to
                            nationalization claims agreement pending at that time, and that
                            extension did not involve commitment future agreements. Also note that
                            Polish balance of payments position at least with US probably has
                            improved over past months. Poland might well be required during course
                            any negotiations to document their balance of payments position.</p>
                        <p>We believe Poland and bloc grain position through 1961 harvest probably
                            sufficiently strained that Poland would accept 3 or 5 years. Also
                            believe that 300,000 tons grain probably should be outside limit any
                            PL480 Agreement prior completion 1961 harvest.</p>

                        <p>The Polish Ambassador called on the Secretary at his own request. He
                            stated that his call was primarily one of courtesy, but that he was
                            leaving for Warsaw in ten days and would like to be able to tell his
                            government <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0091"/>the United States’
                            views on certain subjects, particularly the President’s proposal to
                            explore uses of funds that had accumulated in Poland from U.S. sales of
                            commodities under PL 480. He asked whether there was anything he might
                            say regarding the United States’ ideas of such uses as well as how soon
                            the bilateral discussion of them might be expected to start.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that the negotiation of this matter naturally would
                            depend on when Congress might amend the Battle Act.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d33fn1">For text of the Mutual Defense Control Act of 1951,
                                P.L. 213, approved October 26, 1951, see 65 Stat. 644.</note> In any
                            case, he thought formal negotiations might well be preceded by informal
                            discussions at that time. The United States was thinking, he said, of
                            projects in which the United States and Poland could cooperate for
                            peaceful and friendly purposes, such as research for the solution of
                            problems in medicine and agriculture, for example, as well as
                            undertakings for broad benefit in economic and related fields.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that in another field, that of cultural exchanges,
                            Polish-American relations had developed in gratifying fashion. He said
                            that upon his return from Warsaw he would like to take up with the
                            Department the question of working out an informal agreement to
                            facilitate a further improvement of planning in this field.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that there were two points he would like to emphasize
                            to the Ambassador at this time, regarding the current status of United
                            States-Polish relations. First, he said, he believed these relations
                            were on a solid foundation of friendship and interest, and the United
                            States sincerely wanted to see them continue and develop. Second, there
                            was a critical area of which the Polish Government should take careful
                            note in these relations, that of Cuba. The United States, he said, must
                            take the gravest view of any move from outside this hemisphere to set up
                            or assist an alien power within it. The Monroe Doctrine was very much
                            alive, whatever changes may have occurred in ways of enforcing it. He
                            said he believed Poland’s relations with Cuba were of marginal
                            importance compared with its relations with the United States, and it
                            was to be hoped that Poland would not jeopardize the latter by extending
                            aid to the present Cuban government.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador replied that Poland’s relations with Cuba were only normal
                            trade relations, and that Poland could not say it would refrain from
                            such normal trade with any country. However, he said he understood the
                            United States’ viewpoint which the Secretary was enunciating, and he
                            would report it to his government.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador in closing said that he wished to make a statement about
                            Polish-German relations. In general, he said, Poland’s views were <pb
                                n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0092"/>well known. Regarding the most
                            recent development, however, involving certain approaches to Poland by
                            the German Federal Government ostensibly in the interest of improving
                            their relations, he wished to say that the Polish Government was unable
                            to take them seriously. They did not feel that there was any sincere
                            intention behind the German moves, because these were counterbalanced by
                            contrary German statements and actions which continued to go on at the
                            same time. The Ambassador said he understood the Secretary would be
                            seeing German Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von
                                Brentano</persName> in Washington next week, and he was telling him
                            these things in the hope that he would bear them in mind during his
                            talks with <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName>.<note

                        <p>The Secretary replied that he of course could not speak for the
                            motivation of the German Government in the matter alluded to, but that
                            he was interested in having the Ambassador’s views on the subject and
                            would bear them in mind.</p>

                        <p>The Polish Ambassador called at his request following his return from a
                            month’s consultation with his Government in Warsaw.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that while in Warsaw he had reviewed Polish-United
                            States relations with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_RA1"
                                >Rapacki</persName>, Politburo member Ochab, and other high
                            officials, and that he would like to report to the Secretary on a number
                            of points. His Government was pleased, he <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71"
                                facs="0093"/>said, with the development of cultural exchange over
                            the past year and would like to see it go still further, particularly
                            the exchange of persons. They would also like to make an arrangement
                            with the United States for technical assistance. In the field of
                            consular relations the Ambassador said that his government was generally
                            satisfied, but that the right to establish a consulate in New York City
                            was one improvement which they would like to request. They would prefer
                            to issue only diplomatic visas at Washington and to move their consulate
                            from there to New York, where it would be much more useful to them, he
                            said.</p>
                        <p>In the field of economic relations Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SR2"
                                >Spasowski</persName> said his Government hoped to see a number of
                            developments. They wished there could be a broader licensing of exports
                            of industrial equipment. They were interested in obtaining investment
                            credits from the United States, in addition to the $5 million credit
                            recently negotiated and still pending. As regards trade, they hoped that
                            the question of dumping recently raised against certain Polish exports
                            would be cleared up. The Ambassador wanted the Secretary to know that
                            this question had aroused serious concern in high quarters in Warsaw,
                            since it threw the planning of exports into a state of uncertainty and
                            threatened to delay the expansion of Polish-United States trade which
                            had been counted on after the granting of most-favored-nation treatment
                            last fall.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said his Government was actively looking into the
                            question, raised by President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                                >Kennedy</persName> in his State of the Union message,<note n="1"

                            appropriate uses for Polish currency owned by the United States, and
                            would be ready to negotiate this matter formally when the Battle Act was
                            amended. Meanwhile, he said, they did not look with favor on a direct
                            discussion of this subject with Polish institutions by visiting
                            representatives of private American organizations, and they also hoped
                            that its discussion by the Congress would not involve airing of
                            difficult political issues.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked at this point that we would favor starting
                            informal discussions of ways to use the PL 480 proceeds, even before
                            amendment of the Battle Act.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SR2">Spasowski</persName> next stated
                            that he was instructed to say his Government would like to begin
                            negotiation with the United States of a three-year agreement to obtain
                            further grains, cotton, and oils under PL 480. The Secretary queried
                            whether such a time span might not have drawbacks in view of the
                            impossibility of foreseeing all the complexities that far ahead,
                            particularly outside the economic field. The Ambassador replied that
                            they counted on a continued detente in political relations <pb n="72"
                                xml:id="pg_72" facs="0094"/>and that a longer period than the
                            previous annual loans would facilitate planning and stability.</p>
                        <p>In concluding, the Ambassador remarked that his previous call on the
                            Secretary had happened to take place on the eve of German Foreign
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH1">von Brentano</persName>’s visit
                            here, and that by a coincidence his call today just preceded the visit
                            of Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d34fn2"><persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>
                                visited Washington April 12–13.</note> Apropos of this he wanted to
                            repeat that his Government’s views about Germany had not changed. They
                            felt more than ever that the <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                                >Adenauer</persName> government was a menace because it supported
                            groups demanding territorial revisions and because it was building up an
                            aggressive military potential.</p>
                        <p>Before leaving, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SR2"
                                >Spasowski</persName> informed the Secretary that he was being
                            withdrawn from his Washington assignment and that in the next few days
                            agreement would be requested for his successor, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DE1">Edward Drozniak</persName>, the present Deputy
                            Minister of Finance and President of the Bank of Poland.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary complimented the Ambassador for his conduct of the mission
                            to Washington during a period which had seen United States-Polish
                            relations take a significant turn for the better, and expressed the hope
                            that they might meet again in the future.</p>

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LT1">Lychowski</persName> called on me today,
                            Monday, June 5, 1961, to assure that the U.S. Government, at a
                            sufficiently high and responsible level, understood fully the political
                            implications, as he saw them, of the PL 480 negotiation in which he is
                            now engaged.</p>
                        <p>He believes that if we proceed with this long run agreement there will be
                            two major political consequences. First, American industry will be
                            brought into intimate contact, over a wide range, with Polish industry.
                            I asked him what political basis there was in Poland for such an
                            intensification of contact. He said that <persName corresp="#p_GW1"
                                >Gomulka</persName> had fought and won a major battle; namely, a
                            battle to permit Polish industry to develop on lines of comparative
                            advantage with respect to the international economy as a whole rather
                            than merely on the basis of the requirements of <pb n="74"
                                xml:id="pg_74" facs="0096"/>the Communist bloc. He stated that there
                            were, perhaps, five years in which Poland could make good on <persName
                                corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName>’s policy which evidently went to
                            the degree of long run political independence that Poland might be able
                            to enjoy. And the proposals leading to more intimate association between
                            American and Polish industry were, in his view, crucial to the success
                            of <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName>’s policy.</p>
                        <p>Second, with respect to agriculture, the use of counterpart funds in the
                            rehabilitation of Polish agriculture, combined with the tiding over of
                            the Polish food deficit, would not only guarantee that the relatively
                            free condition of Polish agricultural life would be maintained but that
                            the U.S. would be associated in an intimate relationship with that 47%
                            of the Polish population which is still in rural areas.</p>
                        <p>In general, he expressed the hope that the decision on his proposals
                            would not be taken on the American side without a full appreciation of
                            the political implications as seen on the Polish side. To understand
                            these implications required both political insight and professional
                            economic knowledge of the proposals. It was for that reason, he stated,
                            that he had approached me.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The President opened the conversation by commenting on the change in
                            US-Polish relations that had taken place during the Ambassador’s stay
                            here of the past six years. The President said that he understood the
                            Ambassador had done much to help in this development and had been very
                            cooperative. The President was sorry to see the Ambassador who had
                            contributed so much to these relations leave from his pres-ent
                            assignment. The Ambassador replied that he had tried to do all he could
                            to assist in this improvement.</p>
                        <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0097"/>
                        <p>The President said there had been some recent statements which were not
                            helpful to these relations but he did not believe that they would do any
                            fundamental harm to them. He continued that it was important to have
                            harmonious relations between the United States and Poland since this
                            contributed to reduce international tensions of a general nature. The
                            Ambassador heartily agreed to this last statement and added that his
                            Government wanted to see the further growth of these relations.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then said that he would like to raise two points before
                            leaving. The first of these was economic in character and related to the
                            continuing interest of his Government in the further expansion of
                            economic relations between Poland and the United States. In this
                            connection he mentioned the economic negotiations now in progress and
                            expressed the hope that there would be another agreement for a PL-480
                            transaction. He also referred to the matter of an industrial credit for
                            Poland indicating that his Government hoped that attention would be paid
                            to this interest of Poland. He would be extremely glad if such
                            negotiations would not be too prolonged and, alluding to a statement of
                            the President, he said the results of the negotiations should not be too
                            little and too late.</p>
                        <p>In introducing the second matter that he wished to raise he mentioned
                            that he had discussed several times in the Department during his stay in
                            Washington the German question and its significance for Poland. A focal
                            point of the German question for Poland was the German-Polish border and
                            he desired to recall that the Polish people could not understand the
                            lack of a clearly defined American position on this subject. He said it
                            would be much better for US-Polish relations if the United States
                            Government could make a definitive statement on the boundary.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that the question of the border was connected with
                            the problem of Berlin. It was difficult for the United States to take a
                            position on the boundary question opposed by the German Government and
                            at the same time to obtain any settlement of the Berlin question. As the
                            Ambassador was aware the United States has maintained the position that
                            it was not possible to settle the boundary question until there was a
                            German peace settlement. But if an understanding could be reached on
                            Berlin then some of these other problems might be resolved. The
                            President said that he knew of course how the Polish people feel about
                            the border question. The Ambassador concluded his remarks on the subject
                            of the German-Polish boundary by reiterating that a statement by the
                            United States on this subject would substantially assist relations
                            between the United States and Poland.</p>
                        <p>The discussion then turned again to economic relations between the two
                            countries. The President said that the amendment to the Battle Act had
                            been passed by the Senate and was now in the House. It was indicated
                            that discussions looking toward a new PL 480 agreement were <pb n="76"
                                xml:id="pg_76" facs="0098"/>in progress and that the agreement was
                            expected to be concluded in several weeks. The Ambassador expressed his
                            disappointment that it had not been possible for the United States to
                            extend the credit of $5 million to Poland which had been under
                            discussion from the previous administration. He then referred to the
                            declining curve of industrial credits for Poland pointing out that
                            credits of $30 million had been extended in 1957, $25 million in 1958,
                            $6 million in 1959 and none in 1960. It was explained that while an
                            industrial credit of $5 million had been under consideration for some
                            months problems had been encountered by the US Government because of the
                            extension by Poland of a credit of $13 million to Cuba. It had
                            accordingly not been possible to complete action on this matter during
                            the present fiscal year and the allocation had been lost. The question
                            of further industrial credit to Poland would need to await consideration
                            in the next fiscal year. (At this point the President said that he would
                            like to have from the Department a background paper on the previous
                            request of the Poles for a $5 million credit and on their current
                            interest in industrial credits.) The President then asked who the
                            Ambassador’s successor would be and the latter replied that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Drozniak</persName>, an extremely able
                            man, would be coming to Washington soon to take his place. The President
                            asked what the Ambassador would do as his next assignment to which the
                            Ambassador replied that he would be in charge of African and Asian
                            affairs at Warsaw.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired what the extent of the trade was between Poland
                            and France. The Ambassador said he was not precisely informed about the
                            extent of the current trade between the two countries. As for the trade
                            between Poland and Britain it amounted to $50 million on one side and
                            Polish exports to the United States during last year reached $37
                            million. The Ambassador commented that economic relations between Poland
                            and the United States had increased substantially and said that his
                            Government anticipated a further increase in exports. He said that ham
                            which the Americans liked constituted the principal export to the United
                            States. The President asked if the formation of the Common Market would
                            present problems for Poland and the Ambassador stated that it would.</p>
                        <p>As the Ambassador was about to leave the President said that he had been
                            extremely cooperative and had apparently done much for the benefit of
                            the relations between the two countries. The Ambassador noted the
                            special interest in Polish affairs which the President had taken,
                            expressed appreciation of this and the hope that this interest would
                            continue. In saying goodbye the President indicated that he had a new
                            reason for interest in Polish matters since his new godchild was on one
                            side of Polish descent.</p>

                            States assistance programs to Poland since 1957, a new round of economic
                            talks was initiated with Polish representatives at Washington on June 2.
                            In its initial presentation, the Polish side expressed interest in (1) a
                            large, four-year Title I agreement under PL 480 (sales for Polish
                            currency); (2) a Title IV, PL 480 agreement (long-term dollar credit)
                            for commodities ineligible under Title I; (3) purchase of $150 million
                            worth of United States industrial equipment and technology over the next
                            four years to be financed out of private and United States Government
                            credits and Poland’s own funds; (4) a technical exchange agreement; and
                            (5) utilization of PL 480 zloty proceeds on flood control and other land
                            improvement projects.</p>
                        <p>In response to the Polish presentation, the United States representative
                            stated that due to legal obstacles, pending legislation and
                            international political uncertainties, we were not prepared at this time
                            to consider long-term arrangements under PL 480. Neither were we
                            prepared to consider credits for purchase of industrial goods. We were
                            prepared however to consider (1) a one-year PL 480 agreement under Title
                            I; (2) increased Polish industrial purchases in the United States
                            without reference to United States credits (i.e., out of Poland’s own
                            dollar resources); (3) a possible technical exchange agreement; and (4)
                            uses of United States zloty holdings for projects in Poland which might
                            be possible in the event the Battle Act is amended.</p>
                        <p>Our discussions with the Poles over the past month have concentrated
                            primarily on the subject of a possible one-year PL 480 agreement. The
                            Poles have requested a program amounting to $190–$200 million. <pb
                                n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0101"/>We are now conducting
                            third-country consultations on a program of $91–$125 million. It is our
                            intention, however, to hold the program, if agreed upon, close to a
                            level of $100 million.</p>
                        <p>In view of heightening tensions arising out of the Berlin crisis there is
                            a question whether we should now proceed with any further agreements
                            with Poland. I note that in your conversation with the Polish Ambassador
                            on July 19, you alluded to this question. I believe that a refusal on
                            our part to conclude a PL 480 agreement with Poland in the next few
                            weeks would have serious consequences in our relations with Poland and
                            might well mean the end of the special relationship with that country
                            which has developed since the advent of the <persName corresp="#p_GW1"
                                >Gomulka</persName> regime. The Polish Government would conclude
                            that it could not rely upon the United States as a source of supply for
                            important agricultural commodities and would move quickly to make other
                            arrangements. It would seek imports from other sources, including the
                            USSR, but would probably also introduce a series of restrictive measures
                            at home upon consumers and upon the peasantry.</p>
                        <p>I do not believe that the time has yet come when we should abandon our
                            present policy toward Poland. Maintenance of Poland’s dependence upon
                            the United States for agricultural commodities may in fact be useful
                            since it may encourage <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> to
                            exercise some restraint upon <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>, although this hope should not be relied
                            upon. The principal problem we face, however, is that of explaining
                            publicly the conclusion of a $100 million program for Poland at a time
                            when we are facing the Berlin threat and are taking military and
                            economic measures to meet this threat. I think this explanation can be
                            made. I would recommend that your address to the nation on July 25<note

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LT1">Lychowski</persName> called on me today.
                            He made the following points.</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>The Polish government will announce that its harvest this year is
                                about 1.4 million tons greater than last year’s harvest. This figure
                                will be false. The true increase will be of the order of magnitude
                                of 5–600,000 tons. He said the reason for the lie was that <persName
                                    corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> was under very heavy
                                pressure from other Communist parties to go back to
                                collectivization. He wants to be in the position of saying that his
                                method works well. Further, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LT1"
                                    >Lychowski</persName> stated flatly that the Soviet grain
                                harvest this year will be bad. The 400,000 tons of grain deliveries
                                to Poland from the Soviet Union will come; but they will come late.
                                In the light of the modest increase in the Polish harvest and the
                                probable slowness in Soviet deliveries, he expressed the hope that
                                we would find it possible to provide at least the same amount of
                                grain under the PL 480 agreement as we did last year. That is, he
                                said, 1.4 million tons. He advanced two political arguments for our
                                continued support at this level. First, that we should help
                                    <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> continue to avoid
                                collectivization (he described his mission in Washington as “helping
                                the Old Man” maintain his agricultural policy); second, that Soviet
                                tourists from the western provinces of Russia to Poland are
                                increasing, and an ample Polish supply of bread and meat in Poland
                                is good propaganda. He stated that in Russia, while the cities have
                                enough bread, there is some trouble with the bread supply in the
                                provinces.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>He raised the question of whether, in line with a contingent
                                agreement with the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                                Administration, we might find it possible to allocate in FY 1962 $5
                                million from the contingency fund via the Export-Import Bank for the
                                purchase of industrial equipment in the U.S.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>He told me of the Western European complaint that U.S. PL 480
                                grain was permitting Poland to increase its exports of animal
                                products to Western Europe. He stated that the Department of
                                Agriculture has a long reply to this charge. If it were regarded as
                                a serious matter by the U.S., Poland would be prepared to buy feed
                                grains for dollars in the U.S. up to a limited amount, to be
                                financed through the Export-Import Bank via the contingency fund;
                                or, alternatively—as I understood his argument—Poland <pb n="81"
                                    xml:id="pg_81" facs="0103"/>would be prepared to buy feed grains
                                in dollars if the contingency fund were used to finance an
                                equivalent amount of the transport costs of PL 480 grain
                                shipments.</item>

                        <p>I have examined the question of the economic negotiations with Poland,
                            and concluded that it would be desirable to come to an agreement
                            incorporating the present State Department offer of 500,000 tons of
                            grain and the Polish request for a promise of a review in the light of
                            the actual size of the Polish harvest. I think the agreement to review
                            should be used as a means of getting better performance from Poland in
                            respect to: (a) information to the Polish people on American aid; (b)
                            the selection of exchange students, which should be done by our
                            Foundations, rather than the Polish Government; and (c) to the extent
                            that the law permits, use of counterpart zloty on projects such as
                            schools and hospitals, which demonstrate to the Polish people American
                            concern for them.</p>

                        <p>Basic economic activity is mutual commercial trade. Actual and potential
                            benefits of increased dollar earnings from growing exports to US are a
                            major Polish regime incentive to exercise some restraint in its
                            relations with US. Conversely, significantly reduced export expectations
                            especially if due US Government restrictions would weaken US influence
                                <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84" facs="0106"/>potential and probably evoke
                            bitter regime recriminations of bad faith in view mounting Ex-ImBank,
                            PL–480, and nationalization claims re payment obligations over next
                            years. On import side, Polish purchases US goods relatively unimportant
                            to Poland except for high technology already limited by export licensing
                            procedures. Complete discontinuation licensing US exports to Poland
                            mentioned reference telegram will not seriously pinch Polish economy
                            unless in concert other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries.
                            Unilateral refusal all licenses by US would, however, create ill-will
                            Polish regime to no useful purposes but would result diversion Polish
                            hard currency earnings to other Western suppliers who already have
                            competitive advantage due geography, ability offer credit terms, and
                            more expeditious licensing procedures. Furthermore, this would be
                            contrary US effort maneuver Poles into increased purchasing and

                        <p>Most important economic activity in terms actual and potential US
                            influence is PL–480 grain deliveries for which Poland has real immediate
                            and long term need. Expectation US may meet major portion this need is
                            the major tangible and negotiable Western restraint on Polish regime.
                            Its removal would stimulate retrogressive domestic forces and promote
                            further deterioration US-Polish relations with adverse effect other US
                            programs in Poland. PL–480 is the major component of the economic
                            framework constructed by US over past five years to support a wide range
                            of US informational and cultural programs and facilitate general US
                            access here. However imperfectly this framework may be operating at
                            present, it does serve to maintain US-Polish communication at a scope
                            and depth unique to the Communist bloc.</p>
                        <p>While further US Government and private credits primarily for industrial
                            purchases are greatly desired by Poland, there is no reason believe
                            regime prepared make any significant concessions obtain them. Also such
                            credits not essential element maintenance reasonable level relations.
                            Other important but not critical activities in US-Polish economic
                            relations include US Government support private US charity programs,
                            direct remittances, including PL–480 local currency projects, etc. While
                            these carry economic benefits, they also serve enhance US presence in
                            Poland.</p>
                        <p>Pending and potential economic activities include <gloss target="#t_ICA1"

                        <p>In sum, continuing and prospective economic benefits provide tangible

                            YUGOSLAVIA AND POLAND</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Problem</hi>: The President decided at the White House
                            meeting on September 22<note n="1" xml:id="d45fn1">No record of this
                                meeting has been found.</note> that export licenses for shipments to
                            Yugoslavia and Poland should not be issued pending review of this
                            question. Such licenses have been withheld since September 18.</p>
                        <p>Prior to September 18 our treatment of exports to Yugoslavia and Poland
                            was derived from our general policy toward those countries, based upon a
                            careful and continuing analysis of our long range interests and
                            objectives. To make a determination on the future licensing of exports
                            to Yugoslavia and Poland, it therefore seems essential to re-examine the
                            validity of our general policies toward those countries. A
                            re-examination of our general policies is also desirable in order to
                            provide future guidelines for other aspects of US relations with these
                            two countries, including the daily conduct of diplomatic contacts, aid
                            programs, trade policies, technical assistance activities, cultural
                            exchange arrangements, etc.</p>
                        <p>It is important at the outset to emphasize the profound differences
                            between Poland and Yugoslavia. Their internal political and social
                            structures are different; their general international postures are
                            different; their relations with the US are different. Accordingly, the
                            treatment they have received from the US has differed considerably. The
                            principal point of similarity between the two countries is their mutual
                            dedication to the general philosophy of Marxism, but even this
                            philosophy has been interpreted and applied in different ways.</p>
                        <p>In terms of US interests and objectives, there is no more validity in
                            lumping Poland with Yugoslavia than there would be in lumping Tunisia
                            with Ghana. Therefore, while the need for re-examining our policies is
                            equally urgent for both countries, it is essential that each country be
                            considered separately.</p>

                        <p>Up to the present time, US policy toward Yugoslavia has been based on the
                            following premises: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Yugoslavia, while subject to a Communist dictatorship, is not
                                    a part of the Sino-Soviet bloc. In 1948 the Yugoslav Government,
                                    under <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s leadership,
                                    broke away from Soviet control and the international Communist
                                    movement. Since that time Yugoslavia has shown a vigorous
                                    determination to preserve its national identity and freedom from
                                    outside domination.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>To a considerable extent, Yugoslavia has opened itself to
                                    Western ideas and institutions. It has also evolved an economic
                                    and political system which differs substantially from that of
                                    the Soviet Union. Yugo-slavia’s economy has undergone a process
                                    of decentralization with definite elements of competition and
                                    individual incentive. In this connection, it is important to
                                    note that Yugoslavia has achieved a rate of economic growth
                                    greater than is found anywhere in the Soviet bloc.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Yugoslavia’s independence of Soviet control has been
                                    emphasized by Yugoslavia’s participation as member or observer
                                    in certain international organizations in which the Soviet bloc
                                    does not participate and which, in some respects, are
                                    antithetical to Soviet ambitions. These include the <gloss

                                        <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>. Yugoslavia is also a
                                    member of the International Convention for the Protection of
                                    Industrial Property, which protects US patent and trade mark
                                    rights in Yugoslavia. While the US has no formal copyright
                                    relations with Yugoslavia, few serious copyright problems have
                                    actually arisen.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>Within the context of the “cold war”, Yugoslavia is a neutral
                                    country and usually behaves as such. It frequently takes
                                    positions on international issues that are opposed to US
                                    attitudes and interests, but this is equally true of other
                                    neutral nations. In the UN, for example, Yugo-slavia’s voting
                                    record corresponds more closely with that of India than with
                                    that of the Soviet bloc.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>US trade with Yugoslavia, while moderate in volume,
                                    nevertheless serves US economic interests. Our overall balance
                                    of trade with Yugoslavia is decidedly favorable, and Yugoslavia
                                    is a significant market for US agricultural surpluses.</item>
                                <label>6.</label>
                                <item>The US has a definite interest in maintaining Yugoslav freedom
                                    from Soviet control. In addition to our obvious desire to
                                    prevent the expansion of Soviet domination over Yugoslavia
                                    itself, the continued independence of Yugoslavia affords certain
                                    special advantages in our world-wide resistance to Sino-Soviet
                                    imperialism. It has profoundly <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88"
                                        facs="0110"/>disturbed the political and ideological unity
                                    of the international Communist movement. It has definitely
                                    encouraged nationalist, anti-Soviet tendencies among the
                                    populations of the Soviet-dominated states of Eastern Europe.
                                    The fierce Soviet and Chinese attacks on Yugoslav “revisionism”
                                    and “deviationism” have vividly reminded Marxist sympathizers in
                                    all parts of the world that the Sino-Soviet bloc is not
                                    satisfied with a mere triumph of ideological principles, but
                                    demands direct subservience to the bloc.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>On the basis of the foregoing considerations, the US has maintained a
                            relationship with Yugoslavia generally similar to that maintained with
                            other neutral nations. We have pursued friendly and frank diplomatic
                            contacts, have conducted extensive information activities in Yugoslavia
                            and have carried on a broad exchange program. Yugoslav requests for
                            economic and technical assistance have been considered on their merits,
                            and trade with Yugoslavia has been conducted as with other friendly and
                            neutral countries.</p>
                        <p>The US Government had reason for keen disappointment concerning <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s speech and the general role of
                            Yugoslavia at the recent Belgrade Conference. We have already expressed
                            to the Yugoslav Minister of Foreign Affairs and to the Yugoslav
                            Ambassador here, as well as in writing to the Yugoslav Government in
                            Belgrade, our disappointment and displeasure over the Yugoslav
                            performance. However, as Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KGF1"
                                >Kennan</persName> has pointed out, we would be merely sowing
                            misunderstanding if we took action which would imply that the Belgrade
                            Conference has created a wholly new and unprecedented situation.</p>
                        <p>It seems clear that our diplomatic pressures have already produced
                            certain effects. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_PK1"
                                >Popovic</persName>’s recent speech at the UN clearly indicates a
                            Yugoslav desire to redress the balance and to reaffirm Yugoslavia’s
                            status as a truly non-aligned country.</p>
                        <p>Despite the frequent differences that will inevitably arise between the
                            US and Yugoslavia, it is important that the US never lose sight of its
                            own basic interests. It is important to the US that Yugoslavia remain
                            independent, that it continue to present to the satellite states the
                            magnetic picture of a successful alternative to bloc membership under
                            Soviet domination and that it continue to be a disruptive element in the
                            international Communist movement.</p>
                        <p>The Department is well aware of the domestic implications of any US
                            policy toward Yugoslavia. The fact that Yugoslavia has adopted the
                            Communist ideology inevitably creates strong domestic pressures against
                            amicable US-Yugoslav relations. These pressures tend to increase when
                            the Yugoslav Government makes offensive pronouncements. Nevertheless,
                            affirmative US policies toward Yugoslavia have, <pb n="89"
                                xml:id="pg_89" facs="0111"/>over the years, been supported
                            consistently by informed public opinion and by the Congress in a long
                            series of legislative actions.</p>
                        <p>The Department believes that the fundamental interests of the US are
                            served by continuing to recognize and support the independence of
                            Yugoslavia from Sino-Soviet domination. Continuity is obviously a vital
                            ingredient in the success of such a policy. We cannot succeed if we
                            permit our basic premises and goals to fluctuate with the constantly
                            shifting winds of international events.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">B. Special Problems</hi></p>
                        <p>In the practical application of our general policies toward Yugoslavia,
                            it is necessary to give attention to such problems as (a) trade
                            relationships, (b) economic grants and loans, (c) technical assistance,
                            (d) travel, (e) cultural exchanges, etc. At the present time, however,
                            the only issue which requires an urgent decision by the US is the recent
                            suspension of export licensing.</p>
                        <p>The US already has certain agreements with Yugoslavia on technical
                            assistance. Any extension of these agreements will require review and
                            possible revision. Yugoslavia has also filed a new application for one
                            million tons of grain under the PL 480 Program, but this application is
                            very recent and has not yet even been discussed with the Yugoslavs. It
                            may also be desirable to review certain other specific aspects of our
                            relations with Yugoslavia. However, with the single exception of export
                            controls, all these matters can be considered with relative leisure.</p>
                        <p>The Department believes that the recent suspension of export licenses to
                            Yugoslavia is inconsistent with US interests for the following reasons: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The suspension of licenses implies that the US is lumping
                                    Yugoslavia with the remainder of the Soviet bloc, which is not
                                    only unsound on factual grounds, but which also has a political
                                    significance far out of proportion to its economic
                                    effects.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>The economic significance of withholding individually
                                    validated licenses for exports to Yugoslavia is limited. About
                                    92 per cent of the items controlled by the Department of
                                    Commerce can be exported to Yugoslavia without individually
                                    validated licenses, and over 80 per cent of US-Yugoslav trade is
                                    in this category. For the remaining 8 per cent of controlled
                                    items, licenses have generally been issued subject to Yugoslav
                                    assurances concerning transfer to third countries. We have no

                                    assurances, with one exception in 1957, when the Yugoslavs
                                    admitted a mistake in permitting the diversion of a borax

                                <item>Virtually all the items withheld from Yugoslavia by our recent
                                    suspension of licenses can be obtained without difficulty from
                                    Western Europe, Japan or elsewhere in the Free World. Thus, even
                                    if it were assumed that the export of certain items to

                                    highly dubious assumption) the suspension <pb n="90"
                                        xml:id="pg_90" facs="0112"/>of licenses would accomplish

                                <item>The only substantial effect of withholding licenses for
                                    exports to Yugoslavia would be political. A continued suspension
                                    would be interpreted to mean that the US has altered its basic
                                    concept of Yugoslavia as an independent nation, or else would be
                                    interpreted as an indication that the US is reacting toward
                                    Yugoslav behavior at the Belgrade conference in an abrupt and
                                    vindicative manner. In either case, the basic interests of the
                                    US would suffer, both in terms of our relations with the
                                    Yugoslavs themselves, and in terms of the attitudes of other
                                    nations toward the US. In the words of Ambassador <persName
                                        corresp="#p_KGF1">Kennan</persName>, “It is one thing to
                                    speak of modifying previous levels and nature of aid programs;
                                    it is another thing to deprive the Yugoslavs of normal
                                    opportunities for trade with the US … Drastic and punitive
                                    measures affecting trade as well as aid would only silence our
                                    friends, vindicate anti-Western extremists … and cut off more
                                    hopeful possibilities. So final would this be in its effect on
                                    possibilities for my own usefulness here that I would hope the
                                    Department would give me an opportunity for personal
                                    consultation before taking steps of such gravity.”<note n="2"

                                that we continue to make developmental loans on a project-by-project
                                basis; that the work of voluntary relief agencies be re-examined;
                                and that we grant only about 40 to 50 per cent of outstanding
                                Yugoslav requests for wheat, and considerably less in other
                                commodities. All these recommendations should be carefully reviewed
                                here in Washington, but there is no great urgency involved.</item>

                        <p>Poland, unlike Yugoslavia, is clearly a member of the Soviet bloc. It is
                            bound to the USSR not only through such formal instrumentalities as the
                            Warsaw Pact, but also because of its exposed geographic position, its
                                <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0113"/>heavy economic dependence
                            upon the Soviet Union, its desire for support against fears of a
                            resurgent Germany, etc. Even more important is the fact that Soviet
                            troops are still present in Poland. The Polish Government, in any
                            “show-down” situation, would have no genuine alternative but to submit
                            to the Soviet will. The Polish position on international issues is
                            rarely distinguishable from that of the Soviet Union itself. In brief,
                            Poland is under heavy Soviet influence and US policies must fully take
                            account of this fact.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, it is equally important to recognize that Poland is by
                            all odds the softest spot in the Soviet system. It differs from the
                            other bloc members in a number of significant respects. First, since the
                            establishment of the <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName>
                            regime in 1956, the Polish Government has enjoyed a measure of
                            independence which, while limited, is nevertheless unique within the
                            bloc. The people of Poland have a long-standing antagonism toward Russia
                            and basic orientation toward Western civilization. Only a small part of
                            Polish agricultural land has been collectivized. Essential freedom of
                            worship exists in Poland, including the teaching of religion to children
                            by the clergy and the operation of a university and seminaries by the
                            Catholic Church. The Polish Government permits a diversity of expression
                            in the arts which is unmatched elsewhere in the Soviet bloc, and
                            intellectual activity is fairly vigorous. The Polish Government has also
                            been more restrained in the exercise of police power, as evidenced by
                            the relative absence of political arrests and greater freedom of
                            movement within the country. Finally, the Polish regime permits more
                            extensive and active contacts with the West than are permitted by other
                            satellite states. This is true in terms of scientific and cultural
                            contacts, tourist travel and the emigration of large numbers of Poles to
                            various Western countries.</p>
                        <p>Under the <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> regime, there has
                            also developed a considerable expansion of relations with the US. US
                            officials in Poland are able to maintain and develop broader contacts,
                            both with officials and with private citizens. US consular officers are
                            able to carry on their activities with considerable freedom and on a
                            much larger scale than is possible in other bloc countries, including
                            services on behalf of American citizens. US volunteer agencies (<gloss
                                target="#t_CARE1">CARE</gloss>, Church World Service, etc.) are able
                            to administer food distribution programs which include full
                            identification of the source of the distributed goods. The US has been
                            able to maintain a <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>-type program in
                            Poland, including the establishment of a reading room open to the
                            public, the distribution of the Information <hi rend="italic"
                                >Bulletin</hi>, the publication of a monthly magazine and the
                            circulation of a considerable volume of American books, films, etc. The
                            US has formal treaty relations with Poland covering patents, trademarks
                            and copyrights, and there has been no evidence of Polish “piracy” with
                            respect to any of these rights. <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>
                            broadcasts are not jammed in Poland. Finally, the US <pb n="92"
                                xml:id="pg_92" facs="0114"/>has been able to develop a far more
                            extensive exchange program with Poland than with any satellite
                            country.</p>
                        <p>Total US exports to Poland are similar in dollar volume to US exports to
                            Yugoslavia. The balance of trade is distinctly favorable to the US, and
                            the US retains the right to demand gold or hard currency for its exports
                            to Poland. Surplus agricultural commodities represent a sizable
                            proportion of Polish imports from the US. Thus, the US itself derives a
                            significant economic advantage from its trade relations with Poland.</p>
                        <p>In developing future US policies toward Poland, it would be erroneous and
                            dangerous to base such policies on the illusion that Poland is likely to
                            be detached from the bloc in the immediate future. On the other hand, in
                            view of the circumstances described above, it is apparent that Poland
                            enjoys a significant measure of autonomy, particularly in the pursuit of
                            internal policies, which the rest of the bloc does not possess in any
                            comparable degree.</p>
                        <p>In essence, two courses of action are open to the US. The first is simply
                            to write off Poland, along with all other countries within the Soviet
                            bloc, as a “lost cause” and to concentrate our energies solely on
                            maintaining a defensive posture against the further expansion of
                            Sino-Soviet influence. The second alternative is to take such steps as
                            are available and practical to “carry the war to the
                            enemy”—specifically, to seize all reasonable opportunities to increase
                            Western influence and weaken Soviet influence in Poland over an extended
                            period of years, with the ultimate objective of helping Poland to become
                            a completely independent nation.</p>
                        <p>The second alternative necessarily implies the application of special
                            policies to Poland in such fields as trade, commercial credits, economic
                            and technical assistance, exchanges of persons, etc. The application of
                            these special policies inevitably involves uncertainties, since our
                            ultimate goals can be achieved, at best, only over a long period of
                            years.</p>
                        <p>In brief, the second alternative is a calculated gamble. However, the
                            first alternative is wholly defeatist. The first alternative would imply
                            US acceptance of the thesis that a Communist triumph in practically any
                            country must be regarded as permanent, and that the continuing struggle
                            between the Sino-Soviet empire and the Free World must therefore be
                            waged exclusively upon the territory of the latter.</p>
                        <p>For the reasons indicated, the Department has accorded Poland a
                            considerable measure of special treatment since 1956. This policy was
                            never expected to produce any sudden or dramatic results. On the other
                            hand, this policy has unquestionably brought some visible gains. It has
                            helped to preserve the changes distinguishing Poland from the other bloc
                            states, to keep the door open to wider American access to the Polish
                            people and to maintain the intrinsic Western orientation of the great
                                <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0115"/>mass of the Poles. This
                            policy also continues to provide a lever by which the US can hope to
                            influence the future destiny of Poland and to moderate the actions of
                            the entire Soviet bloc. Because of these benefits, our policy has
                            received widespread support among interested domestic groups, such as
                            the Polish American Congress.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">B. Special Problems</hi></p>
                        <p>The application of our general policies toward Poland to the specific
                            areas of trade, aid, exchanges of persons, etc., obviously requires
                            greater tactical flexibility than is the case with Yugoslavia. This is
                            true because our immediate objectives are more limited, because our
                            contacts with the Poles are more restricted, because the risks of
                            liberal treatment are greater and because Poland, as a member of the
                            bloc is necessarily involved in US decisions affecting the bloc as a
                            whole, such as the Berlin crisis.</p>
                        <p>At the present time, there are two issues in our relations with Poland
                            that require urgent decision. The first involves the willingness of the
                            US to conclude an agreement already tentatively reached with Poland for
                            the shipment of 86 million dollars worth of grain under the PL 480
                            program. The terms of this tentative agreement provide that Poland will
                            pay for this grain in local currency, which the US will have the option
                            of either using within Poland or, at the end of a 10-year period,
                            converting into dollars or gold. (These terms are similar to those which
                            have been applied to past PL 480 transactions with Poland.)</p>
                        <p>While naturally Poland is anxious to conclude this agreement, the US has
                            thus far hesitated to do so because of the Berlin crisis.</p>
                        <p>The second problem requiring urgent decision involves the field of export
                            controls, and specifically the recent suspension of licenses for
                            shipments to Poland. In past years, the policy of giving special
                            treatment to Poland has been applied to the field of export controls, as
                            well as to other activities and relationships. The preferential
                            treatment given Poland has been limited, but it is perhaps the basic
                            explanation of the fact that Poland, as compared with other bloc
                            countries, accords the US special treatment in overall relations.</p>
                        <p>Our preferential treatment of Poland can best be illustrated by comparing
                            the export licensing policy applicable to Poland with the licensing
                            policy which has been applied to the remainder of the Soviet bloc. In
                            the past, about 10 per cent of the items controlled by the Department of
                            Commerce could be exported to the Soviet bloc under general license.
                            Another 80 per cent required individually validated licenses, which were
                            usually granted upon application. The remaining 10 per cent, consisting
                            of items on the Positive List and the GRO Exception List, likewise
                            required individually validated licenses, but applications for these
                            were usually denied to other bloc countries.</p>
                        <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0116"/>
                        <p>In the case of Poland, about 90 per cent of the items controlled by the
                            Department of Commerce could be exported under general license. The
                            remaining 10 per cent, consisting of items on the Positive List and the
                            Polish GRO Exception List, required individually validated licenses.
                            Licenses for these items were sometimes granted to Poland if they were
                            determined to be “reasonable and necessary to the Polish civilian
                            economy”.</p>
                        <p>The recent decision to suspend export licenses for shipments to Poland
                            and Yugoslavia still leaves Poland in a better position than the
                            remainder of the Soviet bloc with respect to general licenses, but
                            actually gives the other bloc countries somewhat better treatment than
                            is given to Poland in the issuance of individual licenses, since action
                            is at least permissible on applications from the former. This is wholly
                            incongruous with the general US policy toward Poland.</p>
                        <p>Since August 25, 1961, there has been a more rigorous application of
                            criteria in our controls over exports to Eastern Europe as a whole. The
                            Department concurs in this tightening of export controls, which apply to
                            Poland along with the remainder of the Soviet bloc. Nevertheless, the
                            Department strongly believes that the general freeze on individual
                            licenses for exports to Poland should be lifted, and that we should
                            revert to the previous policy of according preferential treatment to
                            Poland, for the following reasons: <list>

                                <item>The maintenance of preferential treatment for Poland in
                                    granting US export licenses is an extremely important element of
                                    our overall policy toward Poland. The termination of this
                                    preferential consideration would be interpreted by the Poles,
                                    and by various allied and neutral nations, as an indication of a
                                    basic change in the US policy of distinguishing between Poland
                                    and the remainder of the bloc, and might well be interpreted by
                                    the Polish people as evidence of a US decision to “write off”
                                    Poland as a lost cause. This would inevitably strengthen the
                                    hard-line, pro-Soviet Communists in the <persName
                                        corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> regime, would have a
                                    profoundly discouraging impact upon Western-minded Poles, and
                                    would tend to nullify the gains that we have made in our
                                    relations with Poland since 1957.</item>

                                <item>The current suspension of individually validated licenses for
                                    exports to Poland has a relatively minor effect upon the total
                                    volume of US exports to Poland. Nor is it likely to have any
                                    significant effect upon US strategic interests. As Embassy
                                    Warsaw points out, refusal of licenses will have no economic
                                    result except to divert Polish hard currency earnings to other
                                    Western suppliers. Here again, as is true in the case of
                                    Yugoslavia, the principal impact is political and
                                    psychological.</item>

                                    basis whatever for justifying such discrimination, either to the
                                    American people, to the Poles or to other nations of the

                                <item>Within the framework of our general policy toward Poland, it
                                    is recognized that tactical situations may arise which will make
                                    it desirable for the US Government to exert pressures upon
                                    Poland. It is also recognized <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95"
                                        facs="0117"/>that the general field of export controls
                                    affords an opportunity for the exertion of such pressures.
                                    However, it seems obvious that the US must give the most careful
                                    consideration to any measures of this kind before putting them
                                    into effect. We must have a clear understanding of our
                                    objectives in exerting pressure, we must choose the particular
                                    measures most likely to be effective, we must choose the proper
                                    time and circumstances and, finally, we must always try to
                                    maintain a balance between our short-term and long-term
                                    objectives.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Leaving aside all other considerations, it seems obvious that the present
                            moment is the worst possible time to exert special pressures against
                            Poland in the field of export controls. In the near future, we may be
                            required to take stern measures against the Soviet bloc as a whole,
                            including Poland, because of the Berlin crisis. Western contingency
                            planning for economic countermeasures against the Soviet bloc is already
                            underway. However, there are three vital elements to be considered in
                            planning these countermeasures. The first is that the economic
                            countermeasures should not be applied unilaterally by the US but should
                            be applied by the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries as a
                            whole. Second is that such economic countermeasures should be applied to
                            the entire Soviet bloc, without distinction among individual members of
                            the bloc. The third is that these economic countermeasures should be
                            applied at a time when they are likely to produce a maximum impact upon
                            the Soviet bloc in relation to the Berlin crisis.</p>
                        <p>The withholding of licenses for exports to Poland represents a unilateral
                            move by the US, prematurely timed and directed against a particular
                            country. The continued withholding of these licenses would thus diminish
                            the force of properly-timed, concerted Western countermeas-ures, and
                            would also severely complicate the difficult problem of obtaining an
                            agreement among the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries on
                            the application of such countermeasures. In brief, we seem to be
                            bringing pressure against the wrong country at the wrong time in the
                            wrong way.</p>

                                preferential treatment for Poland as compared with other bloc

                                August 25, 1961, of applying more rigorously the criteria for
                                granting individual licenses, in accordance with the general
                                tightening of controls over exports to the Soviet bloc as a whole.
                                However, Poland should continue to receive the same degree of
                                preferential treatment over other bloc members that it has been
                                accorded in past years, unless and until the Berlin crisis warrants

                            requested that I review assistance programs to Poland and make

                        <p>In view of the limited scope of the assistance problem, the pending

                            June and the need to reach a decision at an early date the Department
                            believes that this matter might well be settled without bringing it

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Background of PL 480 Negotiations</hi>. PL 480
                            agreements with Poland have been concluded annually between 1957 and
                            1960 for a total of $365 million. In negotiations this summer most of
                            the details were worked out for an agreement totalling $86.3 million and
                            including the sale of 500,000 tons of wheat, 100,000 tons of barley and
                            lesser amounts of other surplus commodities. These negotiations were
                            suspended and the Polish Ambassador informed on September 1 that, in
                            view of the current international situation, we were not prepared to
                            sign the agreement at that time. We told him that we would review the
                            situation during the following month to see if it would develop in a way
                            which would make conclusion of the agreement possible.</p>
                        <p>In the following weeks the Poles, while informally indicating that they
                            understood our having to delay signature of the agreement, pointed out
                            the serious difficulty which an extended delay would cause them in
                            seeking to satisfy their grain requirements for the coming year. They
                            have emphasized that, even with increased deliveries from the USSR and
                            about 500,000 tons of grain purchased for hard currencies from Canada,
                            Finland, Switzerland and West Germany, they will have a substantial
                            short-fall. They also point out that, in connection with their economic
                            planning for 1962, the effects of failure to work out a solution to
                            their grain requirements in the near future would be serious, and <pb
                                n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0120"/>might include political
                            consequences which could adversely affect the independent status of the
                            Polish farmer as well as US-Polish relations.</p>
                        <p>Because of the Berlin crisis and domestic discussion of economic
                            relations with the Soviet bloc it was decided to delay action on the PL
                            480 agreement and to review economic relations with Communist countries.
                            In informing the Poles of the delay in conclusion of the PL 480
                            agreement, we had in mind the possibility that our action might
                            encourage them to seek to exercise a beneficial influence with Moscow in
                            connection with the Berlin crisis. There is no evidence available to
                            indicate what effect it has actually had. We are satisfied, however,
                            that whatever effect may have been achieved in this direction cannot be
                            sustained by further delay. Also, we have already substantially exceeded
                            the period of delay indicated to the Poles.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> regime came to power
                            in 1956 in the face of dramatic pressure by the Polish people for
                            liberalization and an end to the unhappy period through which Poland had
                            passed during the previous decade. While <persName corresp="#p_GW1"
                                >Gomulka</persName> was able to restore order and preserve the
                            system of Communist rule, his regime has been characterized by major
                            divergencies from the pattern of the rest of the Soviet bloc which
                            affect not only the situation within Poland but its role in the bloc and
                            in the world.</p>
                        <p>The measure of independence which <persName corresp="#p_GW1"
                                >Gomulka</persName> won in 1956 has been reflected in domestic
                            policies which are unique in three important respects: <list>

                                <item>Agricultural land was returned to the peasants. Except for 13%
                                    of arable land held in state farms (most of which is in formerly
                                    German areas), only 1% of Polish agricultural land is
                                    collectivized. The remaining 86% is farmed by private farmers to
                                    whom <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> has stated
                                    that they will never again be forced into collectives.</item>

                                <item>An understanding was reached with the Catholic Church under
                                    which essential freedom of worship has been permitted, including
                                    the teaching of religion to children by the clergy and the
                                    operation of a university and seminaries by the church. While
                                    there have been stresses in the relationship between the regime
                                    and the church, these freedoms continue to exist.</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>The area of civil freedom has been expanded. The power of the
                                    police has been significantly restrained, resulting in a marked
                                    relaxation of the atmosphere of fear and suspicion which
                                    characterizes life in the Soviet bloc. Diversity in the arts and
                                    intellectual life is permitted to a degree unmatched in the
                                    bloc. The Polish theatre, the graphic arts and literature all
                                    reflect the existence of an area of self-expression which, while
                                    not extending to open criticism of the regime, is not fettered
                                    by the requirements of “socialist realism”. Travel within Poland
                                    and beyond its borders is freer than in any other Eastern
                                    European country.</item>

                        <p>Since 1956, Poland has also played a special role in the international
                            sphere. Within the Soviet bloc, the very existence of a Communist
                            country <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0121"/>in which unorthodox
                            domestic policies are pursued inevitably exerts an influence in other
                            bloc countries which complicates regime efforts at maintaining orthodoxy
                            as well as the general effort to foster homogeneity in the bloc. Beyond
                            the bloc, Poland has developed a pattern of relationships with the West
                            which is unique. This has made possible contact with the West and
                            influence from the West to such an extent as inevitably to affect the
                            situation within Poland.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">United States Activities in Poland</hi>. The
                            development of bilateral relations with Poland since 1956 has made
                            possible a considerable expansion of US activities there. Officers of
                            the Embassy in Warsaw as well as visiting US officials have been able to
                            maintain broad contact with Polish officials and other citizens as well
                            as to move freely about the country in performance of their functions.
                            Embassy officers are able to represent the interests of American
                            citizens to a degree and through means which are not possible elsewhere
                            in the Soviet bloc. US voluntary agencies are able to administer food
                            distribution programs which include full identification of the source of
                            the distributed goods and delivery directly to the recipient. <gloss
                                target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> programs are not jammed in Poland. We
                            have been able to maintain a modest <gloss target="#t_USIA1"
                                >USIA</gloss>-type program, including circulation of an official US
                            magazine and an International Media Guarantee program, of $1.2 million
                            per year. Finally, we have been able to develop an exchange program
                            involving both the US Government and a number of American foundations
                            and other private sponsors which is considerably larger and less
                            fettered by government controls than any other in the orbit states of
                            Eastern Europe. We have been able to contract for various types of
                            agricultural, medical and vocational rehabilitation research programs,
                            financed out of zloty proceeds from PL 480 sales.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Role of US Assistance to Poland</hi>. The
                            deliveries of foodstuffs have contributed significantly to the total
                            supply of these essential commodities. Deliveries of cotton have had a
                            noticeable impact upon the important Polish textile industry and upon
                            the supply of textiles and clothing in Poland. The Polish people are
                            aware of the nature and importance of US aid which, therefore, serves
                            our purpose of demonstrating our interest in their welfare.</p>
                        <p>More important, the development of the US activities and programs in
                            Poland described above has gone hand in hand with the program of US
                            economic assistance which began in 1957. There can be little doubt that
                            PL 480 deliveries including the prospects for their continuity have had
                            an important influence on the receptivity of the Polish Government to
                            other US Government activities in Poland.</p>
                        <p>Since 1957 the US has satisfied a significant portion of Polish grain
                            requirements, having provided a total of almost 4 million tons of wheat
                            and other grains. It is not in our view an exaggeration to state that
                            our <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0122"/>deliveries of these
                            commodities have constituted an underpinning for the continuation of
                            Poland’s essentially private agricultural system.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Effect of Further Delay in Concluding PL 480
                                Agreement</hi>. We believe that a further delay in concluding a PL
                            480 agreement will produce a reaction to the detriment of US programs
                            and thus of our influence in Poland. Our policy toward Poland since 1957
                            has been delicately adjusted to a complex situation. If it is to be
                            successful in the long run there must be continuity in our actions so
                            that those in the Polish regime who take the risk of advocating more
                            extensive relations with the US will have ground for doing so. There is
                            considerable indication that the Polish leadership includes, besides
                            those individuals who support the policy of active relations with the US
                            and other Western countries, others who oppose these and who urge more
                            orthodox domestic policies and closer ties with the Soviets. The latter
                            would very likely exploit a break in the continuity of the PL 480
                            program in an effort to restrict the scope of US-Polish relations and to
                            bring about a retrogression in domestic policies, particularly as
                            regards the status of the peasantry.</p>
                        <p>There are some signs that the delay in concluding a PL 480 agreement has
                            already had effects on our relations with Poland. The Polish Government
                            has, for example, postponed dedication of the American Children’s
                            Hospital in Krakow. We have also learned that the Polish Embassy in
                            Washington has received instructions to begin the liquidation of the
                            Polish commercial mission in the US. The latter action is said to result
                            from the fact that the mission’s presence is not justified by its
                            present workload.</p>
                        <p>We have been informed by a number of Polish officials in Warsaw and
                            Washington that some solution to the problem of their grain requirements
                            must be found urgently. They have pointed out in this connection that
                            economic planning for 1962 must be completed by the end of November. It
                            is probable that in the absence of an indication of continued grain
                            deliveries under PL 480 that the Polish Government will resort to the
                            reintroduction of certain coercive measures to obtain grain which is
                            being withheld by the peasants. The implications of such action for the
                            continuation of Polish agricultural policy are apparent.</p>

                        <p>It is in the light of the situation described above that we must now
                            consider whether to continue to withhold the PL 480 agreement or to take
                            some action to conclude an agreement. The decision should, we believe,
                            take into account factors affecting both the international situation and
                            our relations with and policy toward Poland. We do not believe that
                            developments since September with regard to the international situation
                            are such as to justify conclusion at this time of the full agreement
                            negotiated last summer. We do believe, however, that our purposes <pb
                                n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0123"/>would best be met by the
                            conclusion as soon as possible of an agreement of approximately half the
                            value of the $86 million agreement negotiated last summer. Signature of
                            this partial agreement could be coupled with a statement that we would
                            be prepared, if conditions permit, to consider other Polish needs under
                            PL 480 at a later time.</p>
                        <p>Such action, while helping to meet Poland’s urgent need for foodstuffs,
                            would, we believe, satisfy our purposes in avoiding the deterioration of
                            our relations with Poland. It would, at the same time, clearly indicate
                            that we continue to regard the international situation, as it affects
                            our relations, as not in a condition which would justify conclusion of
                            the full agreement originally negotiated.</p>
                        <p>The most urgent Polish need at present is for grains. This then should
                            constitute the basic component of the partial agreement. The Department
                            of Agriculture, however, for domestic marketing considerations which it
                            feels are highly important, desires to program also the vegetable oils
                            included in the draft agreement previously negotiated. It is satisfied,
                            moreover, that the vegetable oils can be justified as a necessary
                            foodstuff. Although we do not believe inclusion of the vegetable oils is
                            necessary for foreign policy reasons, we concur, for the reasons stated
                            by the Department of Agriculture, that they be included in the partial
                            agreement.</p>

                            Chief and the Head of the American Desk were called away for a long
                            telephone conversation. On their return they asked me whether I would be
                            free to call on the Prime Minister at 4:30 that afternoon. I replied I
                            would be honored to do so. My ensuing talk with Cyrankiewicz reported
                            below lasted just over an hour.)</p>
                        <p>After an opening exchange of amenities, I commented US-Polish relations
                            were good but required further improvement, especially after the events
                            of the current year. It was our feeling Poland was perhaps apt to take
                            its relations with the US too much for granted and was not fully aware
                            of our problems.</p>
                        <p>We had been trying to help Poland and the Polish people but this had
                            recently proved difficult. Certain statements and press articles had
                            been published which affronted the dignity of the US and had provoked a
                            vivid reaction in Congress and among the American people. Furthermore
                            our economic programs did not seem to be appreciated and it had been
                            noted in Washington that no publicity whatsoever had been given to the
                            extent of US economic assistance to Poland. A goodwill visit of some of
                            our Congressmen to take part in the cornerstone-laying ceremonies for
                            the Krakow Hospital had been cancelled from the Polish side and this
                            step was resented in influential Congressional circles. I said I was
                            hopeful that some relaxation of international tensions might soon occur
                            and that we would be able to go ahead with some of our plans for Poland.
                            I sincerely trusted the Polish Government would take advantage of these
                            possibly favorable opportunities and would devote closer attention to
                            US-Polish relations and to meeting our needs for their maintenance and
                            improvement.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister replied he would be happy to comment on some of the
                            difficulties which arose on the Polish side. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> had stated US assistance was
                            being given to break Poland away from its Soviet ally. This objective
                            was unacceptable. As to the Krakow visit, the Polish Government
                            understood that some Congressmen were to be included who were unfriendly
                            to Poland and who hoped to exploit their trip to make hostile propaganda
                            at a time when international relations <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105"
                                facs="0127"/>were already tense. An economic program for this year
                            had earlier been discussed with the US but had been abruptly cancelled
                            because of Poland’s supposed misdeeds over Berlin. Such political
                            pressure was unacceptable. As to publicity, the Government had sent its
                            Deputy Prime Minister to Krakow with me to inaugurate the new
                            galvanizing line at Nova Huts. The Prime Minister was happy to learn
                            that discussions had been reopened in Washington on a curtailed economic
                            program for this year but two principal obstacles had to be overcome.
                            Because of the break-off of the previous talks, Poland had been forced
                            to assign large quantities of foreign exchange to the purchase of wheat
                            abroad. Now it was being required by the US to buy 200,000 tons with its
                            own dollar resources. The money could not be provided in the established
                            plan. Furthermore Poland was being asked to alter its exchange rate in
                            accounting for the local currency deposits. This simply could not be
                            done.</p>
                        <p>I replied as follows. Secretary Dulles in October 1957 had made it clear
                            the US did not wish Poland as a military ally and Poland was free to
                            make such arrangements for its security as it found necessary, although
                            of course we hoped it would be able to act of its own free will. Any
                            other idea would be unrealistic.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the Krakow visit by our Congressmen, this had been
                            proposed as a goodwill gesture which might ease relations by
                            concentrating attention on a common humanitarian objective. It had been
                            my experience that unfriendly persons usually left Poland with a better
                            feeling after witnessing Polish achievements and experiencing its
                            hospitality. It was still regrettable this opportunity had not been
                            seized by the Polish Government but I would do my best to alleviate the
                            misunderstanding on my return.</p>
                        <p>With further regard to the Nova Huts ceremony, I reiterated my
                            appreciation for the Deputy Prime Minister’s participation but observed
                            that, as had already been mentioned in Washington, no mention had been
                            made of those portions of my speech reporting that the total of our
                            credits to Poland now amounted almost to half a billion dollars—a very
                            sizable figure and a substantial benefit to Poland’s economy.</p>
                        <p>As regards the history of this year’s economic negotiations, the Prime
                            Minister ought to realize this. We did not attach political conditions
                            to our assistance. Poland was free to come to its own decisions
                            regarding the German question but must realize we meant business over
                            Berlin and that if our rights were infringed a most dangerous crisis
                            would ensue. Perhaps Poland in its own interest should consider the
                            problem further and suggest moderation from the Eastern side.</p>
                        <p>The point I wished to stress with the Prime Minister was that while we
                            did not make political conditions we were forced, because of the
                            pressure of public and Congressional opinion, to take account of
                            political <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0128"/>conditions as they
                            are. My country’s good faith had been directly attacked in statements
                            from which I had to disassociate myself on occasion by leaving
                            diplomatic receptions where I was a guest. Although I respected, while
                            disapproving, Polish feelings over Cuba, our Consulate at Poznan had
                            been smashed up in a manner strongly resented by the American
                                people.<note n="1" xml:id="d50fn1">The Consulate was attacked by a
                                mob directed by Polish Communist officials on April 19. The incident
                                was reported in telegram 1519 from Warsaw, April 19. (Ibid., Central
                                Files, 748.00/4–1961) The United States formally protested on April
                                20. (Telegram 1526 from Warsaw, April 20; ibid.,
                                122.732P/4–2061)</note> As to our economic programs, we were not
                            asking for thanks but simply for the type of recognition which it was in
                            Poland’s interest to provide if such programs were to continue. I knew
                            that Congressional feeling was especially strong on this point. Again I
                            hoped that tensions would soon ease and I asked the Prime Minister to
                            help those of us like myself and our Government authorities, who were
                            favorably inclined, to go on helping Poland. In speaking frankly I
                            sincerely believed this aspect of our relations had been neglected on
                            the Polish side.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said he had also spoken frankly but thought our
                            discussion had been useful. He had some kind words to say about my
                            contribution to the furtherance of better US-Polish relations.</p>
                        <p>We reverted briefly to the current Washington economic negotiations which
                            I said I would look into on my return home. I referred to the very
                            favorable Polish trade balance with the US and said it was not
                            unreasonable to ask that Poland supplement credits with free currency
                            purchases. The Prime Minister said the Polish Government would be happy
                            to do so next year and in future years, but the request, coming after so
                            much delay this year and Polish purchases of grain for hard currency was
                            unfair. He referred to the Polish textile industry’s preference for, and
                            to a certain extent dependence on American cotton and thought we should
                            do more to encourage this stable market. As to the exchange rate, I
                            suggested it should be possible for the financial experts to find a
                            solution but the Prime Minister was skeptical.</p>

                        <p>At the request of Dr. <persName>Marian Dobrosielski</persName> I had
                            lunch today with him and Dr. <persName>Iwaszkiewicz</persName> of the
                            Polish Embassy. The subject of the discussion, after a certain amount of
                            preliminary talk, proved to be PL480 cotton for Poland. Dr.
                                <persName>Iwaszkiewicz</persName>, who is the Commercial Counselor,
                            detailed at some length the hardships that are being imposed on Poland
                            by the withdrawal of our September offer to supply 40,000 tons of
                            cotton. He indicated that they had with difficulty persuaded Warsaw to
                            allocate $2 to $3 million for cash purchases of cotton. He said that the
                            Embassy had discussed the matter with Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> and Under Secretary Murphy of
                            the Department of Agriculture and Assistant Secretary Martin of the
                            Department of State. I explained that they were indeed the proper
                            channels for the discussion and that I really could add nothing to what
                            they had already learned. The essence of their position was that even if
                            they could not get the 40,000 tons they had originally counted on they
                            would need at least 20,000 in addition to what they could purchase with
                            cash or otherwise they would be faced with a desperate situation and a
                            short week in the cotton industry.</p>
                        <p>Part of the introductory discussion concerned Marxism, Keynesianism,
                            economists and planning in Poland and the U.S. A more substantial part
                            of it consisted of a recital by Dr. <persName>Iwaszkiewicz</persName> of
                            the benefits that PL 480 had already conferred on Poland. These were: to
                            permit a more rapid development of meat production than would otherwise
                            have been possible; to sustain the Polish policy of a relatively free
                            agriculture; and to stimulate the substitution of margarine for butter
                            which, in turn, permitted an increase in butter exports and the
                            development of the domestic margarine and vegetable oil industry. By
                            contrast, Dr. <persName>Iwaszkiewicz</persName> lamented the lack of
                            credit available for industrial purchases and stated the Polish
                            Government’s desire to expand its machinery purchases in the United
                            States. The absence of suitable credit arrangements, however, drove them
                            to a continued reliance on Western Germany and Britain, even though they
                            would prefer to have the U.S. as a supply.</p>

                                agreement, including an insistence that adequate publicity be given

                            Dept requires elaboration several points. (1) Re publicity reftel speaks
                            of full and fair public recognition of past aid. Embassy has earlier
                            reported factual coverage last agreement front pages major papers as
                            well as items covering first and second deliveries. As Embassy aware
                            Dept. has insisted Polish press carry news of PL 480 agreements in
                            pursuance US objective that Polish people be informed of US origin
                            needed commodities. Embassy has reported that Polish people aware PL 480
                            assistance. Request Embassy indicate specific deficiencies press
                            coverage, keeping in mind US objectives this regard as well as inherent
                            limitations such coverage. (2) Reftel mention of US desiderata implies
                            specific conditions or concessions against which level agreement should
                            be balanced. Dept has recently informed Poles continued failure deal
                            with dollar bonds can affect economic relations. In pursuit aim of
                            increasing normal procurement agricultural commodities by Poles, we
                            required Poles purchase 200,000 MT feed grains and now considering
                            package purchase cotton under which portion would be cash or short-term
                            credit with remainder PL 480. Leverage these or other elements bilateral
                            relations limited by fact that current Polish request understood as
                            supplementary December agreement and new conditions or terms raise
                            questions including that of good faith. Request indication specific
                            desiderata Embassy believes Dept should seek associate current Polish

                                        >Rapacki</persName> submitted an amended proposal on
                                    November 4, 1958; see ibid., pp. 1217–1219. On March 28 in
                                    Geneva, he submitted to the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament
                                    Committee another revised plan for a nuclear-free zone in
                                    Europe; see ibid., 1962, vol. I, pp. 201–205.</note> and asked
                                whether he had modified his proposals. <persName corresp="#p_RA1"
                                    >Rapacki</persName> replied that he had made several proposals,
                                originally for a nuclear-free zone and later for a staged plan in
                                which initially the obligation would be not to arm with nuclear
                                weapons states in the area not now possessing them, and later to
                                provide for removal of all nuclear armaments. However, there had
                                been no concrete reactions to his proposals, so he did not now have
                                concrete modifications. The Secretary inquired specifically on the
                                geographic areas of coverage of such zones, and <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> noted proposals on
                                Scandinavia, the Balkans, Africa, as well as Central Europe.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>The Secretary noted that the problem of disarmament could not be
                                separated from its political context. <persName corresp="#p_RA1"
                                    >Rapacki</persName> said that the key was peaceful coexistence.
                                The Secretary recalled—as a soldier in 1945–1946—that the US had
                                demobilized at that time, but had since had to rearm and quadruple
                                its military expenditures due to actions which could scarcely be
                                called peaceful coexistence: Greece, the first Berlin Blockade,
                                Korea and others. Current prospects for disarmament were not
                                separable from political issues, particularly Berlin.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>The Secretary noted that the other side seemed to have disposed of
                                East Berlin, why then could we not dispose of West Berlin, and there
                                would be no problem. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName>
                                treated the suggestion as not a serious one. He countered that in
                                reality the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, and the GDR with
                                its capital in Berlin, both existed. The Secretary commented that,
                                candidly, in this off-the-record conversation, he felt that if the
                                East Germans had been more successful internally—like the Poles—the
                                question of Berlin would not have arisen. <persName corresp="#p_RA1"
                                    >Rapacki</persName> agreed, commenting that he would not,
                                candidly, attempt to argue that all of the East German population
                                favored the regime. Many had “escaped”. But, he contended, the GDR
                                had renounced <pb n="112" xml:id="pg_112" facs="0134"/>all previous
                                German expansionist designs, and had accepted a just frontier with
                                Poland. These were not entirely popular moves in Germany (East or
                                West), but they were good and necessary.</item>

                            <item>The Secretary inquired whether, frankly, Minister <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> as a Pole, Socialist,
                                “imperialist,” or whatever, did not consider the past history of
                                dangers and difficulties from neighbors both to the East and West,
                                and whether from this standpoint he really wanted to see US troops
                                withdrawn from Europe. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName>
                                replied that they did not propose such withdrawal, but the Secretary
                                noted that others did. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName>
                                stated that they favored disarmament with withdrawal of all troops
                                to their own countries, and early abolition of all nuclear delivery
                                means. The Secretary commented that if nuclear weapons were
                                withdrawn and political issues remained unsettled, there might have
                                to be a very large increase in conventional arms.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>The Secretary noted that, in a broad sense, all the disarmament
                                matters with which we were concerned were “regional” problems of the
                                northern hemisphere. He said that if we were unable to solve the
                                political problems which we faced, he would hate to predict the
                                future of the northern hemisphere—this was by no means a threat, nor
                                was he necessarily pessimistic, but it was recognition of a real
                                danger. The Secretary declared that he considered the greatest
                                danger to be that of both sides sitting down to the conference table
                                believing that the other side would not go to nuclear war. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> and his colleagues were
                                initially stunned. The translation was rechecked at <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName>’s insistence, but he
                                remained non-plussed. The Secretary expatiated on this theme,
                                stating with quiet emphasis that the United States would not be
                                pushed out of West Berlin. He noted West Berlin and South Vietnam as
                                cases of non-“peaceful coexistence” aggression. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> noted that the Poles had
                                only representation on the Commission in South Vietnam. Vice
                                Minister Naszkowski, in an aside interjection, muttered “who was the
                                aggressor in Vietnam,” but <persName corresp="#p_RA1"
                                    >Rapacki</persName> quickly changed the subject to say that
                                Berlin was the key problem and danger. The Secretary stated that the
                                presence of the US in West Berlin was a stabilizing influence, to
                                which <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> did not
                                reply.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>The Secretary commented that over the past century the causes of
                                war had declined—no longer were wars waged over dynastic questions,
                                protection of nationals, for trade rights, or the like. The
                                remaining causes are dangerous enough, but fortunately are fewer.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> demurred from
                                this, noting wars of recent decades. <persName corresp="#p_RA1"
                                    >Rapacki</persName> stated that there had been an important
                                change in that now no class would be served by war, but that the
                                class aspect of policy remained. <persName corresp="#p_RA1"
                                    >Rapacki</persName> stated that so far as they were informed,
                                their side would not do anything to stir up risk of war.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>The question of Germany arose in many contexts. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> did reiterate long-standing
                                themes of West German revanchism and irreconcilability <pb n="113"
                                    xml:id="pg_113" facs="0135"/>to the Polish frontiers. He
                                admitted frankly that the Poles do not want German unification under
                                contemporary circumstances, do not want an all-German election which
                                they know the Communists would lose, and do fear West German
                                designs. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> said he
                                thought the Poles, and the other Socialist countries, were not alone
                                in not desiring German reunification. The Secretary took cognizance
                                of the German problem and suggested reunification as the best
                                long-term guarantee against future recrudescence of expansionist
                                nationalism in West and East Germany. The Poles seemed to be unmoved
                                on this point. The Secretary stressed importance of the integration
                                of West Germany into the European community as a safeguard, and
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> nodded
                                agreement.</item>
                            <label>10.</label>
                            <item>The meeting, which was the first which the Secretary held in
                                Geneva with any Bloc Minister other than the Soviet one, was in a
                                cordial and relaxed atmosphere. <persName corresp="#p_RA1"
                                    >Rapacki</persName> was, of course, under some compulsion not to
                                stray from the established Bloc line on disarmament and the Berlin
                                and German questions (particularly with Naszkowski present), but he
                                managed nonetheless to convey the impression of at least limited
                                independence of judgment and even of policy.</item>

                            <item>The Secretary noted that disarmament involves many problems. For
                                example, our own constitutional practices require us to proceed in a
                                certain way. We have used the term “treaty or treaties” for general
                                disarmament because there are limits on what long-range commitments
                                our Senate can ratify. Our trade agreements are only made for two or
                                three years. We are for general and complete disarmament, but once
                                Stage One has been agreed and put into practice it will be much
                                easier to see the detailed form for the later stages. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> indicated that he
                                understood, but he seemed to interpret the reason for a cautious
                                approach on our part in political rather than juridical terms, and
                                said that he understood that while our general interest was
                                disarmament, special interests in the US were opposed and had to be
                                convinced and overcome. He made no comment on the specific form a
                                disarmament agreement should take (though in his speech earlier at
                                the plenary session he had spoken out for the Soviet draft treaty as
                                the only approach).<note n="1" xml:id="d55fn1">For text of the

                            <item>The problem of the economic problems and consequences of
                                disarmament was briefly discussed. <persName corresp="#p_RA1"
                                    >Rapacki</persName> stated that Poland had for her part disarmed
                                to a degree in 1956–1957, without serious economic difficulties. The
                                Secretary noted that with due time economic adjustments occasioned
                                by disarmament were no problem for the US. And the US would like
                                nothing better. In individual cases, such as the locality around a
                                large aircraft plant, there were of course some short-run problems.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> raised the
                                question of economic aid to other countries. The Secretary noted
                                that this depended in part on the readiness of the recipient
                                countries to absorb aid. <persName corresp="#p_RA1"
                                    >Rapacki</persName> pressed on the question, mentioning India as
                                an example, and discussion followed on the economic, social and
                                health context of effective aid.</item>

                            <item>The Secretary remarked that he would like to note in this private
                                discussion that a sophisticated understanding was needed on both
                                sides of the peculiar problems impinging on US-Polish mutual
                                relations. On the one side, we recognize that Warsaw has only
                                limited influence on relationship between Warsaw and Moscow. On the
                                other side, we hope they will realize that internal US political
                                situation and the imperatives of internal political debates compel
                                us to take public account of Poland’s membership in the Communist
                                Bloc. We base our relations with Poland, however, on the basis of
                                bilateral interests rather than simply with Poland as a member of
                                the Communist Bloc. When <persName corresp="#p_RA1"
                                    >Rapacki</persName> had clarified that the Secretary was not
                                seeking an agreement on reciprocity of these considerations, but
                                rather noting them as illustrations on each side of matter requiring
                                delicate understanding, he agreed.</item>

                            <item>The Secretary asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1"
                                    >Kohler</persName> to speak of any problems in bilateral

                                    >Kohler</persName> noted the improvement and satisfactory state

                                agreed. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> noted hopes
                                for increased trade, including Polish interest in capital investment
                                goods as well as in consumer goods. The Secretary reiterated that
                                the US understood that Warsaw was not able to ignore broader US-USSR
                                differences, but that we did not hold Warsaw responsible for
                                them.</item>

                                what he considered to be the biggest change in Soviet policy since
                                the death of Stalin. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName>
                                replied that peaceful coexistence, the “reconstruction” of the
                                general line of Soviet foreign policy under <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, was clearly the major
                                change. As specific points, he mentioned meetings with Western
                                leaders, travel and opening up of contacts between peoples. The
                                Secretary stated that we were concerned over such indications of
                                non-peaceful interests as the declaration of the communist parties

                                of faith and expectation, that was one thing; if a program of
                                action, that was another. It often appeared to us that it was the
                                latter. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> replied that
                                it was a matter of belief, and of action in striving to win economic
                                competition, which they saw as the main arena. The Secretary pressed
                                for clarification of such declarations, and <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> responded with the same

                                    >Khrushchev</persName> had never said that they would force
                                communism on anyone, that forceful imposition of socialism was not
                                possible. Naszkowski added that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                    >Khrushchev</persName> had in fact asserted that force would not

                                public but in closed session (apparently in November, 1960) that
                                peaceful economic competition was the only means to victory for
                                communism. He also said that in closed session <persName

                                (Later in the discussion, in an apparent allusion to this figure of
                                speech, <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> said the

                            <item>The Secretary remarked that he hoped relations between the US and
                                the USSR could be on the basis of state interests rather than
                                ideologically motivated political action. The Secretary added that
                                he thought the Soviets were beginning to see this too, and that one
                                of the issues of dispute between the Soviets and the Chinese was on
                                this basis. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName>
                                <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0138"/>replied that the Soviets,
                                and Chinese too, did act on the basis of national interests. They
                                shared the same general aims. The US, declared <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName>, has been placed in the
                                unsought position of potential arbiter between the USSR and
                                Communist China. The Secretary expressed surprise. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> commented that the US, by
                                demonstrating the possibility and success of the peaceful
                                coexistence policy, can bring the Chinese and Russians together on
                                the basis of such a policy. The Secretary remarked that having us as
                                a common foe was one of the chief elements holding the USSR and
                                China together. The Secretary asked about Communist pursuits of
                                world revolution, as perhaps against their national interests.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> dismissed “world
                                revolution” as a discredited Trotskyite slogan, and reaffirmed the
                                belief of the Communists in victory through demonstration of a
                                superior economic system.</item>

                            <item>The Secretary noted that there were those who saw some possibility
                                of a gradual evolutionary merging of our widely disparate systems.
                                Thesis and antithesis (of present systems) might lead to a new
                                synthesis. In the US, large corporations paid 75 percent of their
                                profits in local state and federal taxes. There was some planning
                                involved in import-export arrangements. The Secretary said that
                                Ambassador Galbraith had once written that in “Socialist” India
                                there was more free enterprise than in the US. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> noted that there were
                                different kinds of “socialism”. India and Cuba don’t have socialism
                                in the sense they understand it. There are differences between
                                Polish, Soviet, Chinese socialism. When India does have socialism,
                                it will be its own form.</item>

                            (Perhaps as <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Drozniak</persName> suggested,
                            publicity will pose no problem, however when we discussed it with him in
                            Warsaw he dismissed our complaint as unjustified and no
                            consequence.)</p>
                        <p>I believe we must show the Poles now that we really mean business on
                            publicity. To do so will provide an immediate practical test of Polish
                            intentions, possibly settle the problem, and facilitate moving on to
                            other matters in the forthcoming negotiations. To fail to do so now only
                            postpones the matter unnecessarily and prejudices its later presentation
                            in Warsaw. Parenthetically, <persName corresp="#p_GW1"

                            countries. The denial of <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> treatment
                            to Poland and Yugoslavia would run directly counter to our policy, which
                            has been to draw those countries closer to the West and to provide an
                            alternative to their dependence on Soviet Bloc countries in trade and
                            other fields. Such legislation would also be undesirable in that it
                            would limit Presidential flexibility in dealing with our bilateral
                            relations with Poland and Yugoslavia.</p>
                        <p>The material effect of the denial of <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>
                            treatment to Poland and Yugoslavia would not be substantial in terms of
                            our own import trade, and might not be great in terms of present levels
                            of Polish and Yugoslav export trade to this country. However, it could
                            seriously impede the growth of their trade relations with this country
                            in particular, and, by limiting their earnings, with the West in
                            general. We could also expect our action in withdrawing <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> treatment to serve in a real sense as
                            an indication to our allies of a hardening attitude and policy toward
                            both Poland and Yugoslavia. We could expect such an interpretation to
                            encourage in Western Europe the taking of harder lines toward Poland and
                            Yugoslavia not only in the field of trade but in other broader areas of
                            policy. Our action might indeed be welcomed by nations whose products
                            compete with those of Poland and Yugoslavia, e.g. Greece, and any
                            subsequent action on our part to restore <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >MFN</gloss> treatment to these countries could be made difficult by
                            such attitudes on the part of our allies.</p>
                        <p>The ultimate consequences for Polish and Yugoslav policies would be out
                            of proportion to the effects of our action in the field of trade. The
                            Polish and Yugoslav reactions would probably be extreme. The full
                            consequences of our action would be certain to slow the existing
                            favorable developments in extending our influence in those countries.
                            Additionally, we would have to reckon with the possibility that past
                            favorable <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0143"/>developments might
                            even be reversed. Taken in conjunction with other factors in today’s
                            international situation, such as Soviet pressures on Poland to support
                            fully Soviet policies in Germany, and Polish and Yugoslav fears of the
                            possible effects of the Common Market on their European trade, we could
                            expect a realistic if not pessimistic reassessment on their part of the
                            desirability of relying upon the West. This is particularly true of
                            pro-Western individuals who may have staked their personal positions
                            upon the prospects of the increasing association of their country with
                            the West and who would suffer disillusionment at this negative and
                            backward-turning action of the United States.</p>
                        <p>With specific reference to Poland, it will be recalled that on April 16,
                            1958, in the wake of the changes which had taken place in Poland since
                            1956 and consistent with developments in United States policy toward
                            Poland, President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                            approved a recommendation that Most-Favored-Nation status be restored to

                                P.L. 50, the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951, approved June
                                16, 1951, see 65 Stat. 72.</note> was analogous to the earlier
                            explicit finding by the Secretary of State that Poland was a “friendly
                            nation” within the meaning of PL 480, the criteria for such
                            determination being identical for the two acts.</p>
                        <p>In restoring <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> status to Poland, we had
                            in mind the connection between Poland’s ability to earn dollars in the
                            United States market and its ability to meet its substantial dollar
                            obligations to the United States. These include contingency fund credits
                            totalling $61 million, dollar repayment obligations under PL 480
                            agreements which, by now, exceed $400 million, obligations to American
                            national holders of Polish dollar bonds, and $40 million in settlement
                            of nationalization claims.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Yugoslavia, there is no reason consistent with the
                            established legislative criteria dealing with <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >MFN</gloss> treatment which would justify taking what amounts to
                            punitive action against Yugoslav trade with the United States. There is
                            no question of Yugoslav domination by <pb n="122" xml:id="pg_122"
                                facs="0144"/>the world Communist movement, and Section 5 of the
                            Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951 has never been applicable,
                            therefore, to Yugoslavia. We are convinced that the withdrawal of <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> treatment would be interpreted as an
                            indication that the United States considers Yugoslavia has returned or
                            is in the process of returning to the Bloc.</p>
                        <p>There can be no doubt that the taking of legislative action to deny
                                <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> treatment to Poland and
                            Yugoslavia would constitute a reversal in a real sense of our
                            long-standing policies toward these countries. Moreover, in the case of
                            Poland the withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> treatment
                            would clearly violate our assurances given to that country at the time
                            of the negotiation of the United States-Polish claims agreement. In
                            neither case can we see any justification nor any gain but only loss. We
                            urge every effort to forestall this action.</p>

                        <p>After describing the satisfaction of his Government at the general course
                            of US-Polish relations, the Ambassador expressed his serious concern
                            over the US intention to delay until about June 1 the sale to <pb
                                n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0145"/>Poland of grain and other
                            commodities under PL 480. If discussions commenced on June 1, it was
                            likely, on the basis of previous experience, that deliveries would not
                            begin until late September. This would coincide with deliveries from
                            Poland’s own harvest and would not alleviate Poland’s immediate need for
                            grain. The Ambassador explained that the present shortage arises from
                            the over-estimation of production last year, as well as the fact that
                            peasant deliveries have lagged because of international tensions and the
                            late Winter in Poland. The Polish Government would not like to resort to
                            forced deliveries and therefore hopes to meet the situation by means of
                            imports from the US. The Ambassador therefore requested that Poland’s
                            request of last February, for 600,000 tons of wheat, be considered
                            immediately. He hoped that a decision could be reached during the visit
                            to the US of Poland’s Foreign Trade Minister, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TW1">Trampczynski</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> asked Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ1">Katz</persName> what were the possibilities for
                            accelerating discussions on grain. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJ1"
                                >Katz</persName> noted that June 1 was not far off. Moreover, he
                            pointed out that the Ambassador’s assumptions about the interval between
                            initiation of discussions and the beginning of deliveries was not
                            necessarily correct. While on some occasions our negotiations were long
                            drawn out because of extraneous factors, we have on other occasions
                            concluded negotiations very quickly, witness the recent amendment on
                            cotton which was concluded in less than five days. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ1">Katz</persName> pointed out that we also wished to
                            evaluate the results of discussions in Warsaw on certain matters of
                            concern to the US.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> emphasized that we were
                            most concerned about Poland’s failure to take steps to settle the
                            problem of defaulted dollar bonds. He requested the Ambassador to
                            impress upon his Government our difficulty in accepting new financial
                            obligations from Poland while old obligations were in default.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Drozniak</persName> stated that
                            during his recent consultations in Warsaw he raised the question of
                            bonds and this question is being considered seriously there. He
                            regretted that he had no instructions as yet. He was informed about
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJ1">Cabot</persName>’s conversation
                            with Deputy Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJ1"

                            conversation each. At Behrman request <persName corresp="#p_TW1"
                                >Trampczynski</persName> outlined future Polish trade West,
                            expressed concern common external tariff Common Market, particularly
                            affecting Polish agricultural exports. However, said 1962–1963 expected
                            no appreciable problem this sector. In discussion possibilities Polish
                            relationship <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, freely admitted
                            problems posed by trade relations two differing economic systems but
                            offered no solutions. <persName corresp="#p_TW1">Trampczynski</persName>
                            stressed importance foreign trade to development Polish economy,
                            asserting that expectations were for growth of industrial goods exports.
                            In reply to question of how Poles would work to reduce common external
                            tariff Common Market, <persName corresp="#p_TW1">Trampczynski</persName>
                            offered no effective reply. Did show considerable interest in working
                            towards method of accommodating state trading procedures to demands of
                            free world traders, but again nothing specific.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_WJ1">Winiewicz</persName> took same position
                            on problems which prevent trade from developing between Poland and
                            United States. First, lack technical knowledge goods available US (2)
                            lack commercial credits (3) tightness export controls. Argument was that
                            without knowledge of technical capabilities of American products,
                            purchases often led to inefficiencies and inadequate tooling up of
                            plant. <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0147"/>Also that relatively
                            greater knowledge Western European and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            capabilities led to greater imports from these countries. On second
                            point asserted <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> Act
                            detrimental since did not affect grade other countries, and on third,
                            that application embargo delayed trade and made planning difficult since
                            could not know what could be obtained and whether future plans might be
                            interrupted or inconvenienced.</p>
                        <p>Behrman replied each of these to effect that first would be resolved if
                            trade opportunities in Poland became greater so that private business
                            felt it worthwhile spend time sales effort, that present was no time to
                            attempt change <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> act but
                            that in fact Poles could take care of situation by joining <gloss

                                >Trampczynski</persName> and Jedrychowski indicated <gloss

                            specifically that consideration had been given to this 1958 but support
                            not forthcoming when Poles took initiative. General impression from
                            discussion was that political realities in bloc prevent any strong move
                            by Poles towards <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>. Seemed to be full

                                which prohibited financial transactions with any foreign government

                            intended pay every cent of debts, including World War I and interim, not
                            indicating any precise period in which this expected to be done. On
                            third point of embargo and trade policy, Behrman stressed attitude
                            Congress as presented by possible position on <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >MFN</gloss> in trade bill and amendments to Export Control Act.
                            Brunt of argument here was that Congress saw no real return to US from
                            deferential treatment to Poles compared with rest of Soviet bloc, and
                            that recent political and economic moves by Poles showed closer identity
                            with bloc, which Congress tended to feel would remove justification for
                            continuing deferential treatment.</p>
                        <p>Jedrychowski stressed <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> treatment
                            negotiated by Poles as part property claims settlement 1960 and removal
                            would be contrary such agreement. <persName corresp="#p_TW1"
                                >Trampczynski</persName> indicated <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >MFN</gloss> worth half million dollars in trade 1961 (our estimate
                            and that of his subordinates considerably larger and would be worth much
                            more in 1962).</p>
                        <p>Conversation <persName corresp="#p_WJ1">Winiewicz</persName> stressed
                            long-run friendship US despite ups downs current problems. Although
                            stressed Poland politically and economically tied Soviet bloc, point
                            also made that reliance by Poland on socialist trade actually much less
                            than assumed outside and probably less than figures showed. Said Polish
                            policy to increase amount trade with West. Behrman replied Common Market
                            economically integrating <pb n="126" xml:id="pg_126" facs="0148"/>with
                            intention trade externally but moving toward political integration as
                            well and that CEMA integration would weaken basis for continuation of
                            Polish deferential treatment. On export control point Wieniewicz argued
                            that no control policy could in fact prevent economic growth and policy
                            had in fact caused creation of shipbuilding industry in Poland—obviously
                            at great cost but now pride of their economy.</p>
                        <p>Jedrychowski and <persName corresp="#p_WJ1">Winiewicz</persName> both
                            made special point at length that no political conditions could be
                            imposed on Poles for continued deferential treatment, that no specific
                            action would be taken to make congressional continuation of deferential
                            treatment easier, and that political and economic unity with socialist
                            group was overriding consideration of all policies vis-à-vis West.
                            Within these limitations <persName corresp="#p_WJ1">Winiewicz</persName>
                            stressed desirability long-run friendship and hopefulness that ups and
                            downs could be weathered. Behrman replied long-run friendship certainly
                            sought and philosophical approach taken by <persName corresp="#p_WJ1"
                                >Winiewicz</persName> hopeful in view fact Congress might at some
                            time restrict flexibility executive.</p>
                        <p>While <persName corresp="#p_WJ1">Winiewicz</persName> particularly raised
                            specific points such as [garble] indebtness and publicity in Poland on
                            US/Polish economic agreements, saying everyone in Poland knew of
                            US-Polish trade relations, no attempt made settle any particular issue
                            nor were any raised from our side. Behrman explained on each occasion
                            that objective was fuller understanding broad situation in which each
                            country had to operate.</p>
                        <p>Although all three made no indication Poland considering any changes
                            external position which could contribute to improvement relations, value
                            of talks lies in opportunity make abundantly clear that Congress unhappy
                            current position these relations and that Poles must consider importance
                            every move which weakens hand of administration in effort continue
                            deferential treatment Poland as member Soviet bloc.</p>
                        <p>Behrman checked with me approach to be taken in discussion. I concurred
                            in a firm line on above points and feel it important that opportunity
                            was taken by Washington official to present this to high officials in
                            Polish Government. Further, every opportunity in future should be taken
                            to stress necessity of Poles to demonstrate mutual profit to US as
                            result of deferential treatment. Behrman concurs in record discussion
                            above.</p>

                        <p>48. Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WJ1">Winiewicz</persName> today
                            called me in and handed me aide-memoire <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >MFN</gloss> matter. This aide-memoire refers to discussions in both
                            houses of US Congress which “have already adopted certain provisions
                            which clearly aim at a return to cold war practices in trade and
                            financial relations.” “As is well known <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >MFN</gloss> clause was restored by <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> in November 1960 in conjunction with undertaking by
                            Polish Government to start compensation payments in amount of 40 million
                            dollars. This undertaking by PPR was in fact made conditional—on basis
                            gentlemen’s agreement—upon granting by US of said clause to Polish
                            exports. Government of PPR has been strictly discharging its
                            obligations.”</p>
                        <p>Aide-memoire then goes on to argue at some length that present
                            obligations already impose strain on Polish balance of payments and that
                            rescinding of <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> “could prevent Poland

                            pointed out that effect of drastic economic measures against Poland
                            would be to cause a sharp worsening in Polish-American relations. He
                            said <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> more important for Poland than
                            PL-480. Such worsening of bilateral relations at moment when world
                            outlook seemed to be perceptibly brightening would be very unfortunate.
                            I said that though impression prevailed in US that Poland getting bulk
                            of benefits from our economic relations and though some illusions
                            regarding Poland had been shattered, I would consider it deplorable if
                            there were to be sudden worsening of relations.</p>

                                violated a U.S. moral commitment. (Ibid., 611.4841/6–2062)</note> I
                            feel strongly that we would be defaulting on moral obligation if
                            cancellation of <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> for Poland should
                            become law. Also considering fact that Poland, if <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> cancelled, probably would not and could
                            not meet obligations, it would seem to me counter-productive from
                            viewpoint our immediate interests to cancel clause. Even for those who
                            believe that Poland should not have benefit of any favorable economic
                            ties with the US, it would seem to me that this is wrong way to go about
                            achieving desired result. I earnestly hope therefore that Congress can
                            be persuaded to reverse itself in this matter.</p>

                            perhaps adding that congressional action makes it impossible to secure

                        <p>I am also somewhat apprehensive of effect congressional action will have
                            on outstanding PL480 Agreements. Embassy has evidence from various
                            sources that Poles are effecting number of economies in their foreign
                            exchange budget. This is probably a reflection of the relative shortage
                            of grain throughout bloc this year and consequent necessity of further
                            hard currency purchases in West coupled with strain of Canadian grain
                            purchases already undertaken. It also probably reflects uncertainty
                            regarding new PL 480 Agreement. Moreover difficulties in fulfilling plan
                            for industrial exports West are apparently causing concern. It is our
                            impression that Poles are genuinely short of foreign exchange to cover
                            what they consider minimum necessary import program.</p>
                        <p>Question of Polish dollar commitments under present PL480 Agreements will
                            of course not arise for nearly 5 years. Nevertheless, I consider it
                            increasingly doubtful whether Poles will or indeed could meet these
                            commitments since most Polish trade with other Western countries is tied
                            to bilateral arrangements and hard currency surplus to repay PL480
                            commitments was scheduled to come largely from increased access to US
                            market. This in turn should presumably be taken into account in any
                            negotiations we undertake regarding new agreement. Poles can be expected
                            to apply increasing pressure for elimination <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131"
                                facs="0153"/>of hard currency repayment provision as date for first
                            payment approaches using line that we have disposed of useless
                            agricultural surpluses and are now demanding dollar repayment while
                            refusing Poles opportunity to earn dollars in US market on equitable
                            basis. On the other hand we must realize that to refuse to enter into a
                            new agreement because of the difficulties which Poland would undoubtedly
                            have in meeting service on such an agreement under present circumstances
                            would result in sacrificing all gains in our relations for past five
                            years and would probably lead to as chilly a period as chilliest of cold
                            war.</p>
                        <p>In any event, I consider it a waste of time to discuss further any

                            (Attention: Mr. <persName>Swank</persName>) From Dutton. Per our
                            conversation:</p>
                        <p>“Memorandum for the President, subject: denial of most favored nation
                            treatment to Yugoslavia and Poland.</p>
                        <p>It is my judgment and that of all of the senior officers of the
                            Department concerned with this matter, that the denial of most favored
                            nation treatment to Yugoslavia and Poland<note n="1" xml:id="d66fn1">On
                                October 4, the Congress passed the Trade Reform Act of 1962 that
                                included a provision denying most-favored-nation rights to any state
                                under Communist control. For text of P.L. 87–974, approved October

                            our relations with these countries and toward our entire position in
                            Eastern Europe. It would run directly counter to our policy of holding
                            out an alternative to those countries which are striving to be
                            independent of international Communism and free from Soviet domination.
                                <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0154"/>It would cause the loss of
                            effective gains we have made in projecting United States influences into
                            Eastern Europe. It would destroy many important and identifiable
                            pro-Western elements in those countries who, according to our best
                            information, are in the ascendancy.</p>
                        <p>The denial of most favored nation benefits will have most serious effects
                            on Yugoslav and Polish trade with the United States. Analysis of trade
                            statistics with Yugoslavia indicates that virtually all of its exports
                            to the United States would be subject to significantly higher duties.
                            Poland has enjoyed <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> benefits only
                            since later in 1960 and has thus only begun its efforts to develop a
                            market here. These efforts, which have had our encouragement, would be
                            nullified. The loss of trade with the United States, taken in
                            conjunction with other international developments, such as the effects
                            of the Common Market on their trade with Western Europe, may be expected
                            to lead Polish and Yugoslav regimes to undertake a realistic, if not
                            pessimistic, reassessment of the wisdom of their reliance on the West.
                            We will have given them but one alternative, that of complete dependence
                            on the Soviet bloc. We will thus have contributed much to an objective
                            neither Stalin nor <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has
                            been able to achieve, the unity of the Communist world.</p>
                        <p>At a time when international Communism is seeking to advance its position
                            everywhere in the world I fail to see why we should now abandon our
                            efforts to carry the war to the enemy. We have every reason to be
                            greatly encouraged by events in Eastern Europe which are unquestionably
                            running in our favor. There are innumerable evidences that in each of
                            the countries in the Eastern European Soviet bloc there are mounting
                            pressures for liberalization and for better relations with the West. In
                            Yugoslavia we have a clear demonstration of the benefits of our policy.
                            We should not be swayed from our course by public statements of old-line
                            Communists such as <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>. We are
                            now witnessing in Yugoslavia the gradual transference of power to
                            younger and less doctrinaire men who are determined to hold Yugoslavia
                            from communism itself. This is not the time for us to write off our
                            extensive investment in this area and to ignore our vital security
                            interest in the future of these countries. The only profit of such
                            action would be for international Communism and <persName

                        </list>
                        <p>After an exchange of amenities the Secretary suggested that one of the
                            topics of conversation might be that of bilateral relations. As the
                            Foreign Minister certainly knows the President has had some difficulties
                            with Congress in regard to legislation pertaining both to trade
                            relations and to aid. It is quite clear that the attitude of Congress is
                            to a large extent influenced by the general political atmosphere. The
                            President bases his own policy on the belief that an improvement and a
                            normalization of Polish-American relations should be possible in spite
                            of existing difficulties upon which, as we all understand, neither
                            Poland nor the United States exercises full control. The task of the
                            President would be much easier if Poland did not publicly take a
                            position in support of policies which create a danger to peace. At the
                            present moment the President has made his own stand clear in spite of
                            the political difficulties which might result from this at election
                            time. He is trying to persuade Congress to keep the door open to the
                            development of normal relations between the United States and Poland.
                            Unfortunately, at the very moment when the President was doing that, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> made a speech in which
                            he supported the Soviet views about Berlin and also there were Polish
                            expressions of solidarity with Soviet policy at a time when Soviet
                            provocations in Cuba have reached a maximum. The difficult task of
                            working for better mutual relations should be one for both governments
                            and these Polish actions have not helped the United States
                            Administration in its endeavors. The Secretary made it clear that both
                            the traditional friendship of the American people toward the Polish
                            people and the personal regard <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0156"
                            />of the Secretary to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName>,
                            as Foreign Minister of Poland, were not at stake. The problem was that
                            of obtaining cooperation from both sides toward the solution of current
                            problems. He invited the Polish Foreign Minister to speak freely.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> said that this was not
                            the first time that he and the Secretary had exchanged frank and free
                            remarks and this mutual frankness undoubtedly has contributed to such
                            improvement in relations as has taken place so far. It has been
                            recognized ever since the first conversations of the Foreign Minister
                            with representatives of the United States, back in 1956 or 1957, that a
                            normalization of relations should be sought in full realization of there
                            being points of disagreement between the two nations. In spite of such
                            points of disagreement in regard to the overall world situation, the two
                            nations could work together to maintain their traditions of friendship
                            and develop their economic and cultural relations. The experience of the
                            last few years has shown that such policies could lead to success and
                            Poland intends to keep on seeking possibilities of closer relations in
                            spite of areas of disagreement.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister understands that there are certain difficulties in
                            the United States at the present moment. He, of course, does not wish to
                            mix in American internal affairs. However, he is somewhat surprised that
                            the United States Government should depend to such an extent on a
                            certain part of American public opinion, even if that part of the
                            opinion finds its expression in Congress. There should be no necessity
                            to depend to such an extent on a part of public opinion.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that it is equally necessary for the United States
                            Administration to take into account American public opinion as it may be
                            for the Polish Government to take into account the Warsaw Pact.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that there is a great difference between public
                            opinion and an international agreement. He may agree that there is an
                            inter-dependence between public opinion and the actions of the
                            government and he recognizes that the United States Government has made
                            great efforts to improve economic relations between Poland and the
                            United States. However, public opinion is something on which the
                            government itself may have an influence. Thus, public opinion is
                            influenced by a situation such as that of Berlin or Cuba, but not only
                            by that—and in regard to the expression of American opinion through
                            recent legislation in regard to Poland, the Foreign Minister feels that
                            in a way it is the actions of the United States Government which have
                            influenced public opinion, only in turn to be influenced by it.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary spoke about certain policies which endanger peace. The
                            Foreign Minister said that this is not anything which is of Poland’s
                            doing.</p>
                        <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0157"/>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that sometimes people have to bear the
                            consequences of their partners’ actions, and this even when they
                            themselves are not fully willing members of the partnership.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> said that he felt that
                            none of Poland’s partners were endangering peace. He is certain that the
                            President of the United States does not wish either to endanger
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>In regard to Berlin, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName>
                            said that there is one point which is particularly serious and that is
                            the question of the presence of Western troops in that city. He was not
                            authorized to express any opinions except his own, nor did he wish to
                            imply that what he has to say on the subject represents anybody else’s
                            opinion. His own opinion is that the question of Western troops in
                            Berlin is not an “absolute question”. If the situation were different in
                            the world, the presence of the Western troops in Berlin would not appear
                            as such a difficult problem. It is necessary to understand other
                            people’s point of view and in particular it is useful for the United
                            States to understand how these things look from Warsaw. The situation in
                            Berlin, and in particular the situation as it derives from the presence
                            of Western troops there, had taken a turn for the worse after incidents
                            such as that of the U–2 plane and after the aggravations of the
                            situation in regard to Cuba last April. If the relations between Cuba
                            and the United States were based on peaceful co-existence it would
                            certainly be easier to negotiate a solution to the question of Allied
                            troops in Berlin.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary had spoken of Soviet provocations in Cuba. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> does not see any such
                            provocations. He knows the facts of the situation and he feels that he
                            has learned a lot from a recent visit to Cuba. This visit leads him to
                            believe that relations between Poland and Cuba will be quite a bit
                            easier than expected. In this respect, he was somewhat surprised at the
                            intervention of the United States Ambassador in Warsaw in regard to Cuba
                            before his departure for his Cuban visit.<note n="1" xml:id="d67fn1"
                                    ><persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> visited Cuba June
                                10–17. According to despatch 482, June 14, Ambassador <persName
                                    corresp="#p_CJ1">Cabot</persName> had warned the Polish
                                Government that the Cuban visit would have a damaging effect on
                                U.S.–Polish relations. (Ibid., 748.00(W)/6–1462) <persName
                                    corresp="#p_CJ1">Cabot</persName> reported on a verbal exchange
                                with <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> over the Cuban
                                visit in telegram 2155, June 26. (Ibid., 748.13/6–2662)</note></p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> mentioned that,
                            although this has nothing to do with the subject of Cuba, the new
                            Ambassador is making an excellent impression in Warsaw.</p>
                        <p>In any case, it cannot even be suspected that the purpose of Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName>’s visit in Cuba was to
                            aggravate the tension between that country and the United States. It
                            was, nevertheless, a very instructive visit and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> would advise the Secretary to
                            perhaps visit Cuba himself.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he doubted whether he would receive an
                            invitation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> said that
                            he might in the future. At the present <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136"
                                facs="0158"/>moment this is not a very concrete subject of
                            conversation. Obviously, the Foreign Minister is not extending any
                            invitations, and the Cubans themselves might be afraid that an
                            invitation on their part might be interpreted as a sign of weakness. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName>’s personal opinion
                            about the Cubans is that they are non-conformist people—something which
                            the United States should well know and which others are discovering now.
                            The Cubans seek their own way and will not follow anybody’s example.
                            They certainly do not intend to copy measures which have failed
                            elsewhere. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> had found
                            more points of agreement between the thinking of Cubans and Poles than
                            he had expected.</p>
                        <p>Reverting to the question of bilateral relations, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> said that he was afraid that the
                            recent decision of the United States Senate might be a step backward in
                            the development of these relations. He has read with great care both the
                            language of the legislation and the interpretations given to it. He
                            feels that there exist possibilities for continuing economic relations
                            in the direction in which they are developing at pres-ent, since these
                            relations are based on a certain number of economic principles. For
                            example, the most-favored-nation clause is tied to certain obligations
                            on the part of Poland; it is thus a matter of reciprocal legal
                            obligations. This point should be made clear since a lack of clarity in
                            this respect influences the marketplace and makes it difficult not only
                            to develop but even to maintain trade at the present level. It should be
                            made clear that the question of the most-favored-nation clause is not
                            one which can be made unilaterally but is a matter of international
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>As for the question of repayment by Poland of pre-war bonds, it is better
                            perhaps to leave it in abeyance until such a clarification is
                            obtained.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the President is trying to leave the door open so
                            as to make normal relations between the two countries possible. At the
                            end of this week it will become known what exactly is the legislative
                            situation. The question of trade is more important than that of aid and
                            in that respect the Executive branch of the United States Government
                            will do whatever is possible, within existing legislation, to maintain
                            good relations and to improve them. It is highly important in this
                            respect to avoid tying together things which do not need to be so tied.
                            If the Polish Government were to retaliate for any one action on the
                            part of the United States by tying to it some other action on the part
                            of the Polish Government—without absolute necessity—this would produce a
                            downward spiral where from retaliation to retaliation relations would
                            worsen.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister asked whether the Secretary had in mind
                            Congressional action.</p>
                        <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0159"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said that Congressional action imposes certain limitations
                            on the possible actions of the Executive branch. It is the policy of the
                            Administration to act towards better relations within such limitations;
                            if, however, the Polish Government, because of some such limitations,
                            were to take retaliatory action on its part, this might lead to a
                            further narrowing of the freedom of action of the Administration and
                            thus precipitate a series of retaliations and counter-retaliations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> said that the
                            most-favored-nation clause is tied to the payment by Poland of
                            indemnifications for nationalized American property.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he urges the Poles not to tie together any items
                            which it is not absolutely necessary to tie together.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> said that he understood
                            that anything which constituted a deterioration in mutual relations
                            might lead to further deteriorations; likewise, improvements may lead to
                            further improvements. In any case, the most-favored-nation clause should
                            not depend on the general political situation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he wanted to speak of his personal experience of
                            the last six months. Very much of his time was spent before Congress,
                            including Committee meetings in Executive Session which are not reported
                            in the press, defending the possibility of maintaining normal economic
                            relations with Poland. Had he been a lawyer, such as his good friend
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_SAEIII1">Stevenson</persName>, he would
                            have said that he received very little help from his client in these
                            endeavors.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SAEIII1">Stevenson</persName> said that
                            the client in question certainly was absent at the time of the debate.
                            The Secretary said that, for example, the Polish position in regard to
                            Berlin did not make his own position before Congress very easy.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the substance of the question of Berlin, the Secretary did
                            wish to say that he wants to make it absolutely clear that the Allied
                            powers are in Berlin to stay. There were opinions expressed recently to
                            the contrary; these opinions are not only unrealistic but also
                            dangerous. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had
                            repeatedly said that Mr. <persName>Macmillan</persName>, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, Mr.
                                <persName>Spaak</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA1"
                                >Fanfani</persName>, and even President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                                >Kennedy</persName>, are ready to agree with him on Berlin; only
                            Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> does not want
                            to agree. Nothing could be farther from the truth, and it is essential
                            that everyone should be aware of that. Passing to the question of Cuba,
                            the Secretary would like to make it clear that there are two points
                            which are not negotiable. One of these is the question of a political
                            and military alliance between the Soviet Union and Cuba. The other is
                            that of Cuban infiltration into other Latin American countries. This is
                            something which the President stated categorically already a year ago.
                            We are not interested in Cuban internal affairs. <pb n="138"
                                xml:id="pg_138" facs="0160"/>We are not even particularly concerned
                            with the Cuban nationalization of American property (which,
                            parenthetically speaking, wasn’t profitable anyhow). We cannot accept,
                            however, the establishment of a Soviet military base in this hemisphere.
                            Finally, in regard to bilateral relations, there are obvious
                            difficulties, but the Administration is still prepared to do whatever it
                            can within the context of the present situation to work for the
                            normalization of these relations.</p>
                        <p>By the way, the Secretary prefers the expression “normal relations” to
                            that of “peaceful co-existence” as the latter has become a slogan which
                            means many things we cannot accept. Thus, the Secretary, when speaking
                            of relations between states, governments or peoples, prefers the good,
                            old-fashioned expression “normal relations” which does not contain the
                            reservations implied by the expression “peaceful co-existence”. This
                            latter expression has been used to describe situations in which there is
                            very little peace—there certainly is no peace in Vietnam and the
                            Secretary is not certain whether there will be peace in Laos.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> said he agreed that
                            peaceful co-existence was not being implemented in many parts of the
                            world, although he might differ with the Secretary as to who is
                            responsible. This expression has, nevertheless, great value as it means
                            absence of war.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that it was described by Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> himself as covering the
                            struggle on the part of the Soviets for the imposition of their system.
                            This is why he prefers the pre-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> and pre-Stalin expression “normal
                            relations”.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> said that the victory
                            of ideology should be pursued only by peaceful competition.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> certainly went beyond peaceful competition
                            when he gave his blessing to so-called “wars of national
                            liberation”.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> said that ideology is
                            not very important if major wars are avoided. If there is no war the
                            world will evolve in such a way—both within each of the three blocs and
                            as to the relations between them—that none of those alive today will
                            recognize.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he hopes that it will be given a chance to evolve.
                            Poland certainly has no interest in any solution which would result in
                            the incineration of the entire northern hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>Returning to the present situation the Secretary said that tensions would
                            certainly decrease if there were to be a de-Stalinization of East
                            Germany—for example (and he had said this to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName>), if the East German regime were to de-Stalinize
                            and if East Germany had a regime similar to the Polish regime of today,
                            current tensions would be greatly reduced.</p>
                        <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0161"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> said that he would
                            certainly hesitate to give advice to the Government of the German
                            Democratic Republic. As a matter of fact—and what he is going to say is
                            an example of his frankness in this conversation—one of the greatest
                            fears the Poles had at the time of their October revolution was that the
                            East Germans might follow their example.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether this was because of the 20 Soviet divisions
                            in East Germany.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> replied no, that their
                            greatest worry was how far the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> might
                            go.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would not ask Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1"
                                >Rapacki</persName> to comment on the following but in the light of
                            Poland’s knowledge of the situation in Central Europe and the fact the
                            German problem will not impinge directly on Polish interests, Poland
                            should know that the presence of American troops in West Berlin is a
                            factor of stability.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that it would be so if U.S. policy itself were
                            “stabilized”. Only in such a case would the presence of American troops
                            in Berlin have a stabilizing effect. Where, however, American policy
                            oscillates under the influence of a public opinion which gives in easily
                            to irritation, the presence of American troops cannot have a stabilizing
                            effect. The effect of the presence of American troops in West Berlin is
                            tied to the entire world situation and would be stabilizing only if
                            American policy were constant and the same in all parts of the
                            world.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the American is a strange animal: when attacked,
                            it defends itself. Given the pressures on Berlin and on Vietnam, and the
                            penetration of this hemisphere through Cuba, we cannot accept a
                            stability which would be like that of a hypnotized rabbit waiting for
                            the snake to strike.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> said that it might be
                            good to think of what happened in Cuba. It is not “we”—and by we the
                            Minister does not mean Poland, but the Socialist “camp”—who started the
                            revolution in Cuba. It is not “we” who isolated Cuba. If the Cubans act
                            as they do it is first of all because they have been isolated. The
                            Secretary certainly is aware of the fact that the Cubans requested
                            permission to buy arms in Britain and only upon the rejection of their
                            request did they turn toward the Soviet bloc.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that this was hardly the whole story. The United
                            States certainly could not tolerate the sending of Soviet agents to
                            other countries of the Western Hemisphere and the provision by Cuba of
                            funds to subversive movements in Latin American.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> said that he did not
                            wish to enter into a controversy in regard to agents, since after all it
                            is difficult to determine whose sources of information are reliable. He
                            repeated, however, that the Cubans acted as they did because they felt
                            isolated and wanted to break out of their <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140"
                                facs="0162"/>isolation. The tempo of the Cuban revolution was set
                            not by the Chinese Communists or the USSR but by the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary concluded by saying that the legislative action of Congress
                            would become known shortly, even though the precise scope of such action
                            is not known today. When Congress finally acts and when we know the
                            situation, time will be needed to see what it means and what are the
                            actual possibilities. Quiet consultations are preferred to hasty
                            reactions. Therefore, the Secretary urged the Polish Government to avoid
                            any hasty reaction to such legislation, whatever might be its precise
                            terms. The Secretary expressed the hope that one day they might talk
                            about Polish-U.S. relations in a sunny climate.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister expressed the hope that it will be possible for the
                            two countries to continue developing their friendly relations.</p>

                        <p>736. Director General Michalowski invited me today to Foreign Office to
                            present note regarding Congressional action directing abrogation of
                                <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> for Poland.<note n="1"

                            this subject and states “Introduction and application of restrictions in

                            States. Withdrawal would not only check mutually beneficial economic
                            relations but also unfavorably weigh on spirit of entire relationship of
                            two countries.</p>
                        <p>In course of conversation Michalowski pointed out that already Polish
                            exporters are receiving numerous cancellations of orders due to
                            uncertainty regarding date of application of <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >MFN</gloss> cancellation. He reflected obvious unhappiness of
                            Polish Government at turn of events and desire to save what could be
                            saved from wreckage. Polish note confirms our thought that Poles are not
                            likely to continue paying on claims agreement once <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> is cancelled. When I gently urged
                            restraint Michalowski pointed out that news regarding <gloss

                            (he was evidently unaware of General Spychalski’s speech <gloss

                                as an example of “imperialist” efforts to undermine socialism in

                                411.4841/10–1562)</note> but would obviously have to be. I said that
                            I was referring to statements and acts which were of no real importance
                            to Poland but very offensive to United States public and Congressional
                            opinion. I said that I would say no more since I was aware that Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> had been incensed
                            by statement I had made to him under specific instructions.</p>
                        <p>While conversation was unhappy one it was personally cordial and there
                            was no need to convince Michalowski that President and Department were
                            strongly opposed to Congressional action. I intimated efforts were being
                            considered to find some satisfactory course of action but I could give
                            him no assurances as to what would happen.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador expressed satisfaction that after so many months of delay
                            the PL 480 negotiations had finally begun. He wished to raise some
                            general problems connected with our bilateral relations, rather than the
                            negotiations per se, but he hoped his point of view would be taken into
                            account before the negotiations were finalized. The past months, he
                            said, were full of expectation, promises and disappointments. (He noted
                            parenthetically that “some officials” of the State Department said they
                            had a right to be disappointed.) He realized, of course, that US-Polish
                            relations were affected by the international situation, and that the
                            Administration was not always able to do what it wished. Nevertheless,
                            facts were facts and the Polish Government could not depend upon
                            intentions and attitudes. The Ambassador said that he wished to call
                            attention to these facts: <list>

                                <item>Despite a promise last December that there would be a further
                                    agreement in the early Spring, and a further promise to begin
                                    negotiations in June, nothing had happened until now. The
                                    promises of last December and June had figured in Polish
                                    planning for animal husbandry. When the U.S. did not provide
                                    grain Poland had to buy grain at great cost in order to maintain
                                    the hog population. The result was a grave deterioration in the
                                    Polish balance of payments.</item>

                                <item>Despite the Administration’s attitude, the Congress had voted
                                    to withdraw <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> from Poland.
                                    This, together with the boycott campaign against goods of Polish
                                    origin, was producing a serious effect on Polish exports to the

                                <item>Poland had expected to see a further development in bilateral
                                    relations with the U.S., i.e., it expected a change in the
                                    Battle Act. Today one hears nothing about this. The Ambassador
                                    noted in this connection that he came here 18 months ago to work
                                    for improved relations; now he has to work hard to maintain the
                                    status quo.</item>

                                <item>To the problems with the U.S. must be added problems with
                                    Western Europe, particularly the Common Market. Some 40% of
                                    Poland’s trade was with the West, but because of trade
                                    difficulties and discrimination, <persName corresp="#p_GW1"
                                        >Gomulka</persName> had recently pointed out that Poland’s
                                    dependence on trade with the West would have to be reconsidered.
                                    In the past five years, Poland had lost $450 million through a
                                    working of the terms of trade. This produced a terrible strain
                                    on Poland’s balance of payments.</item>

                                <item>Poland’s agricultural situation this year was very bad. Grain
                                    production was 2 million tons less than last year, potatoes were
                                    lower by 7.5 million tons, and the vegetable and fruit crops
                                    were very bad. Poland had to import between 2.7 and 2.9 million
                                    tons of grain this year.</item>

                                <item>In these circumstances, Poland expected to receive a proposal
                                    from the U.S. which would recognize Poland’s present situation
                                    and reflect the traditional generosity of the U.S. The U.S.
                                    offer, however, was only $37 million. Without wishing to enter
                                    into details, the Ambassador wished to point out that Poland had
                                    requested 1.5 million tons of grain. The U.S. offered 400,000
                                    tons of wheat. Yugoslavia, he noted, had recently received 1.2
                                    million tons of wheat. Similarly with respect to cotton, Poland
                                    had requested 40,000 tons to cover its deficit. The U.S. offered
                                    4,000 tons.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Summing up, the Ambassador said that in one of Poland’s most difficult
                            years the U.S. made its smallest proposal and had proposed conditions
                            (cash purchase commitments) which were beyond Poland’s capacity at the
                            present time. On the assumption that the U.S. shared Poland’s desire to
                            advance our relations, he requested: <list>

                                    view but from the viewpoint of the Ambassador’s

                            further agreement for grain in the early Spring. In fact we had agreed
                            to consider further sales of wheat. We had considered this and concluded
                            that we were not in a position to offer additional wheat and so informed
                            the Ambassador at the time we signed a supplemental agreement for cotton
                            and rice. The current negotiations were a new round, unrelated to last

                        <p>However, <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Lychowski</persName>’s instructions
                            not to accept cash purchase commitments may well be based on seriousness
                            present policy cash position. Embassy has no way of estimating current
                            status hard currency reserves but believes they must be precariously low
                            in view such desperate measures as cut in number of foreign
                            correspondents and in foreign service salaries. If longer period were
                            allowed for tie-in cash purchases it would perhaps show whether Polish
                            position political or based on lack of exchange. I prefer, however,
                            approach suggested in my <gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss>

                        <p>The Ambassador called this morning at the invitation of the Secretary, to
                            discuss the impasse in the current PL 480 negotiations. The Secretary
                            said that in reviewing the background in the negotiations he found it
                            difficult to understand why the Poles should have been surprised or
                            shocked at our proposal for cash purchase requirements. This proposal
                            seemed to be a reasonable one. The Ambassador replied that there were
                            two aspects of the US proposal which were disturbing. First, the PL 480
                            offer was too small and <pb n="146" xml:id="pg_146" facs="0168"/>did not
                            take into account Poland’s real needs. Secondly, the cash purchase
                            requirement was burdensome, especially at this time when Poland’s
                            balance of payments was so seriously strained. The Ambassador elaborated
                            on this point as he did in his meeting on December 6 with Under
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>,<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d71fn1">See <ref target="#d69">Document 69</ref>.</note> and
                            presented to the Secretary the attached Memorandum<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d71fn2">Not printed.</note> explaining the Polish position.
                            He added that as a former banker he could not advise his Government to
                            take on the cash purchase obligations since he saw no possibility of
                            meeting these obligations.</p>
                        <p>In commenting, the Secretary said that he wished to put aside any thought
                            whether this problem was being considered from a sympathetic or hard
                            point of view. As a former banker, the Ambassador should appreciate our
                            situation. We were in effect offering some $60 million of commodities on
                            terms of about one-third in cash and the balance over forty years. These
                            terms, the Secretary thought, were considerably more favorable than what
                            the Poles obtained elsewhere. Pointing out that the US also faced a
                            serious balance of payments problem, the Secretary said that we found it
                            most difficult to be in the position of subsidizing Polish purchase of
                            commodities elsewhere. Moreover, we had to be careful that we were not
                            subsidizing Polish exports of animal products in competition with our
                            own. The Secretary emphasized that the unwillingness of the Polish
                            Government to assume any cash purchase obligations made it very
                            difficult for us to conclude an agreement. He therefore urged the
                            Ambassador to seek new instructions.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that the US view had been reported not only by cable,
                            but Deputy Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJ1"
                                >Winiewicz</persName> had personally carried back to Warsaw
                            information on the negotiations. In view of the absence of any
                            significant change in the US position he did not believe Warsaw would
                            provide new instructions.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary suggested to the Ambassador that if he felt he could not
                            seek new instructions, he send a letter to Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> stating that the Secretary
                            wished the Foreign Minister to review the problem in the negotiations.
                            The Secretary emphasized that he was not soliciting a counterproposal,
                            since he could not hold out any prospect that such a proposal would be
                            accepted. But there was no reason why we could not continue to exchange
                            views in order to find a solution to our problem. There might be other
                            ways to solve our problems. Why, for example, couldn’t the Poles seek
                            some relief from other creditors, pointing out the contribution the US
                            was making in its very liberal credit terms. The Ambassador hastened to
                            say that to do so would destroy <pb n="147" xml:id="pg_147" facs="0169"
                            />Poland’s credit. But the Secretary pointed out, the Ambassador had
                            impaired Polish credit here by saying that they are unable to accept
                            cash purchase obligations. The Ambassador coughed nervously and muttered
                            something about the difficult situation in which Poland presently found
                            itself.</p>
                        <p>In concluding the meeting, the Secretary reiterated his request that the
                            Ambassador ask Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> to
                            review the problem from the viewpoint of the trade problems of both
                            sides.</p>

                            express his gratitude that the Secretary had taken the time personally
                            to interest himself in the negotiations. He also asked the Ambassador to
                            convey to the Secretary his best wishes for a Merry Christmas and a
                            Happy New Year. Both Ministers, the Ambassador continued, had reviewed
                            the negotiations and after careful study had concluded that it would be
                            possible to rearrange certain plans so as to assure the availability of
                            some hard currency for agricultural purchases in the US. The Polish
                            delegation had received instructions which go quite far in this respect.
                            The Ambassador expressed the hope that the Polish request could again be
                            carefully considered with the view to changing the proportion between
                            the US offer and the cash purchase requirements. The Polish delegation
                            would be in touch with the US side on Thursday, December 27.</p>
                        <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0170"/>
                        <p>The Secretary thanked the Ambassador for the greetings from Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> and stated that he would
                            personally review the US position after the new Polish proposal had been
                            received. The Secretary pointed out that there was one element in his
                            mind which he had not mentioned earlier but of which the Ambassador
                            should be aware, that is the relationship to the <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >MFN</gloss> problem. If the PL 480 agreement were on a good solid
                            businesslike basis, it would be helpful with respect to the <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> problem.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador stated that there was one more comment Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> had made. He expressed deep
                            appreciation that the Secretary had stressed the economic aspects of the
                            agreement. The Ambassador drew attention to the fact that following the
                            Congressional storm of last summer the Polish Government and press did
                            not react despite the many harsh words used in the Congress. In this
                            connection, he asked the Secretary to use his influence to see to it
                            that this transaction not be used to harm Poland’s relations with the
                            Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that he and the Ambassador had discussed this
                            matter before. He had also discussed it with Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> in Geneva.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d72fn2">See <ref target="#d55">Document 55</ref>.</note> We
                            wished to develop our relations with Poland to the maximum extent
                            possible, without regard to other issues which were not entirely within
                            the control of either Poland or the US. Within certain limits, which we
                            hoped will broaden, we could do that. At times, however, this might not
                            be possible. The Secretary had discussed this frankly with Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> and pointed out that if Poland
                            became intimately involved with the most difficult aspect of certain
                            serious problems, e.g., Berlin, the limits of possibility would be
                            narrowed. We, of course, had certain domestic problems which caused
                            things to be said which might better be left unsaid. But we would try to
                            be careful to take into account to the extent possible Polish
                            sensibilities. The basis for our improving relations lay not in
                            reconciling the ideological differences between us but in the enduring
                            friendship between our two peoples. We should try to avoid the
                            ideological problems and to stress those areas where we could broaden
                            our relations. It should be recognized, however, that we both had our
                            political problems.</p>

                        <p>1071. Personal for Secretary from Ambassador. In view personal interest
                            you have shown in PL–480 negotiations with Poles I am taking liberty of
                            setting forth my views regarding them.</p>
                        <p>I am disturbed by increase in our new PL–480 proposals to Poles from 37.1
                            million dollars to 51.6 million together with lessened purchase
                            requirements in view of absence of adequate quid pro quo. I do not think
                            that US-Polish relations have improved in past year. In some respects
                            such as <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> this has been our fault but
                            for most part this has been deliberate choice of Polish Government,
                            i.e., repeatedly expressed Polish position on Berlin, <persName
                                corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> visit to Cuba, refusal to accept
                            Glenn capsule and Medicine-<gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> exhibit
                            et cetera.<note n="1" xml:id="d73fn1">The Polish Government had delayed
                                granting permission for the display of the Glenn capsule, and the
                                United States withdrew its offer. During the exhibition, U.S.
                                officials repeatedly protested against police surveillance and
                                harassment of U.S. delegation members.</note> On record we have
                            certainly no reason to reward Poles for any cooperation they have given
                            us.</p>
                        <p>We must bear in mind that any PL–480 sales are ipso facto help given to
                            member of Soviet bloc and must therefore be justified by other positive
                            considerations. We recognize that PL–480 can be properly and effectively
                            used to increase sales of agricultural products. Although agricultural
                            surpluses mean relatively little to United States, their receipt is
                            vital to Poland and its plans for industrial development. I do not
                            believe we should accept Polish view that criterion should be Poland’s
                            commodity needs but should rather think in terms of how we can best
                            further our policy objectives in our relations with Poland. Unless we
                            keep Poles on short leash we lose leverage which PL–480 sales provide
                            us.</p>
                        <p>I do not understand how Poland can undertake to repay us for additional
                            $50 million worth of commodities if it is frankly unable to assume
                            responsibility for paying a lesser sum of defaulted bonds. I am
                            concerned that there is no end in sight to process of providing Poland
                            with PL–480 commodities and this might ultimately lead to default.</p>
                        <p>It is possible Poles are so short of foreign exchange that they cannot
                            buy grain they need, but it is to be remembered that they have been
                            buying from other markets on relatively short credit terms. If they must
                            purchase grain they can probably secure exchange for it by curtailing
                            plans for industrial development. I believe the Poles are in more urgent
                            need <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150" facs="0172"/>of grain imports now than
                            they have been for past several years and will accept best terms they
                            can get. I have distinct impression that Poles feel confident that we
                            are so wedded to our “special Polish policy” that we can always be
                            pressured into meeting their needs despite lack of Polish cooperation in
                            furthering bilateral relations or Polish willingness to grant adequate
                            quid pro quo in negotiations.</p>
                        <p>I have from time to time and most recently in Embassy telegram 988 of
                            December 18<note n="2" xml:id="d73fn2">See <ref target="#d70fn2"
                                    >footnote 2, Document 70</ref>.</note> suggested other quid pro
                            quos which we might request. (Incidentally, Department apparently has
                            mistaken impression free market grain purchase discussed in Embassy
                            telegram 988 is insignificant whereas fact is substantial quantities are
                            purchased by the state on the free market.) Since offer described in
                            Department telegram 766<note n="3" xml:id="d73fn3">Telegram 766, January
                                3, outlined U.S. proposals for further discussions of a P.L. 480

                            withdrawn. If not accepted within reasonable time, however, I see no
                            impropriety in making alternative offers involving other benefits to
                            United States objectives.</p>
                        <p>I am anxious to know policy considerations under which it was decided to
                            increase our original offer by almost 40 percent since I am concerned
                            lest we use too much carrot and not enough stick. However, whatever
                            misgivings I may have it is obviously essential that any discussions
                            with Polish officials here be closely attuned to those in Washington and
                            I should therefore be grateful for any policy guidance you may wish to
                            send me.</p>

                            negotiations and agree with implication your remarks that this
                            instrument should be used with care and attention to what US may derive
                            from its use.</p>
                        <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0173"/>
                        <p>In case of Poland, more than in number of other countries receiving
                            PL–480 assistance, political factors and considerations transcending
                            bilateral relations play major role in decisions re PL–480 agreements.
                            At same time, economic considerations are weighed carefully, including
                            effect on US market, markets of third countries, and extent of
                            contribution to Bloc economy. Further, we cover smaller portion of
                            Polish deficit than of many other recipient countries, and agreements
                            with Poland unique in requiring repurchase local currencies.</p>
                        <p>Policy which US has pursued toward Poland admittedly involves risks and
                            limited evidence of realization of long-term objectives. I am satisfied,
                            however, that policy remains valid under present circumstances and that
                            essential line should continue. Desirable that we not shift ground at
                            this time of flux in Communist world lest this have undesired effect in
                            decisions which Poland or others might make as result. Desirable also
                            that we not provide further impetus beyond difficulties re <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> and boycott campaign for unfavorable
                            development Polish policy or actions.</p>
                        <p>In so far as consistent with this approach, we have sought to limit
                            PL–480 deliveries to minimum which would meet our objectives. Since
                            1960, quantities have decreased materially and terms changed to require
                            greater commercial purchases. At same time, we have held off agreements
                            to indicate displeasure with Polish actions, for example concerning
                            Berlin. However, as long as we continue to regard agreements as useful,
                            it is necessary to stop short of reductions or restrictions which would
                            make agreement impossible. I recognize that this difficult to determine
                            and that judgments are made on subjective basis and consequently are
                            always open to argument. Each decision has represented consensus here as
                            to best arrangement in circumstances.</p>
                        <p>Recognizing limits on what we expect in short term by way of favorable
                            changes in Polish policy or bloc actions as well as fact that PL–480
                            agreements not seen as permanent fixture nor as without drawbacks, I
                            believe we should continue review use PL–480 in light future
                            developments.</p>

                            feed grains and (2) permit half of value cash cotton purchase (estimated

                            would be negative. We intend confirm negative response later this

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Dick</hi>: I enclose herewith a memorandum
                            prepared by Pic Littell<note n="1" xml:id="d76fn1">Not printed. It
                                summarized Embassy difficulties with the Polish Government.</note>
                            with regard to the road blocks the Poles have been throwing in the way
                            of our cultural program. Whereas I think the other side of the story
                            should be borne in mind also, it does seem to me clear that there is a
                            good deal of quiet sabotage of our cultural program in Poland.</p>
                        <p>I realize that the Department is not willing to tie this matter up with
                            PL–480 and I am not inclined to quarrel with that decision. I do think
                            that, in any case, better tactics are open to us. It would seem to me
                            that when we get tripped on hurdles such as those mentioned by Pic we
                            should squawk as loudly as we can and as, in point of fact, we on
                            several occasions have. Then when the Poles come around again for
                            PL–480, which I confidently expect they will have to, I think that we
                            might make a distinctly modest offer to sell them PL–480 commodities in
                            the amount say of ten to twenty million dollars, the exact amount to be
                            determined by the degree of cooperation they have shown in the preceding
                            year. (Of course if they had really been cooperative I would increase
                            the amount.) I would attach no strings to this other than publicity—in
                            other words, I would make it so attractive in so far as it goes that
                            they would not wish to turn it down even though they would be
                            disappointed in its amount. Then when the Poles come storming in as they
                            did this year and say we were not giving them anything like what they
                            needed I would recount to them sweetly their lack of cooperation during
                            the year, and say that under the circumstances this was all we were
                            disposed to offer. I would trust that these tactics would convince them
                            that cooperation is a two-way street.</p>
                        <p>There are a number of other things which I have mentioned to the
                            Department in the course of the year I have been here, but have received
                            no satisfaction. I continue to feel that I should be instructed to
                            discuss them with the Poles. These include such matters as the
                            outrageous ground rents they charge us for real estate (the Embassy
                            residence property and the school land being horrible examples), the
                            arbitrary rents they have imposed on us, and the discriminatory exchange
                            rate (a Pole can get 72 zlotys for his dollar and an American only
                            24).</p>

                        <p>As it appears unlikely that anything will be done to change the Ellender

                            the exchange rate problem with the Poles prior to any further PL–480
                            discussions. I am not at all convinced that we pressed this issue with
                            sufficient vigor prior to the 1961 agreement and the record is clear
                            that nothing has been done about it since. This is an issue of major
                            significance which has direct relevance to PL–480 sales. (For a recent
                            discussion of this issue you may wish to read Embassy airgram 628 of
                            February 8, 1963.)<note n="3" xml:id="d76fn3">Airgram A–628 reported on
                                Polish press coverage of the P.L. 480 agreement. (Department of

                        <p>I do think that in our relations with Poland it is always important to
                            keep the door firmly open and on that account would not wish to press
                            the Poles on PL–480 to the point that they turned down our final offer.
                            I do believe that we should extend cooperation to them, provided there
                            is some relation between the cooperation we extend to them and that that
                            they extend to us. On the other hand, I think it is very important for
                            us to bear in mind the fact (and it comes out time and again by
                            implication in their own official statements) that our cooperation,
                            notably our PL–480 agreements, are giving them very real help in
                            developing the country’s economy—and after all, Poland is a staunch
                            member of the Warsaw Pact. Therefore, much as I believe in keeping the
                            door open, I do not think we should be over generous. I do,
                            incidentally, believe that we should play square with them and continue
                            to feel that we should maintain <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> for
                            them on both moral and practical grounds.</p>

                            agreement with Poland.<note n="1" xml:id="d77fn1">For text of the

                                the same day, see 14 UST 803.</note> He said that this was a good
                            and useful agreement and particularly timely in view of the bad crop
                            which Poland had had in 1962 and the severe winter, which had already

                            to report to Polish officials, particularly to Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName>, concerning the
                            attitude of the US Government on matters of importance to Poland. He
                            wished, therefore, to pose two questions. The first had to do with the
                            US Government’s view of the perspectives for 1963 concerning major
                            international questions such as the situation in Berlin and Germany and
                            a nuclear test ban and disarmament, including the <persName
                                corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> Plan.</p>
                        <p>Looking at the general international situation, the Secretary replied, we
                            believe that 1963 is a year in which it might be possible to work out
                            agreements which may reduce international tensions. As for cessation of
                            nuclear testing, we want to conclude a test-ban treaty and are
                            disappointed that the USSR has not thus far made it possible to work out
                            an agreement. To us, the key is to obtain adequate assurance that a test
                            ban will be respected. We can understand that the Soviets may not feel
                            that <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0178"/>they require on-site
                            inspection in the US, the nature of our society being such that a
                            combination of 98% open observation and 2% espionage can meet their
                            requirements. We, however, are faced with a large area not accessible to
                            us. We thus have a difference between us not only of policy but of
                            fact.</p>
                        <p>We have, in the face of a difference as to the number of on-site
                            inspections required, proposed that we put the issue of numbers aside
                            and settle the rest of the treaty, leaving President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and Chairman <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> possibly to settle the
                            numbers question once we know what the numbers really mean in terms of
                            treaty provisions. The Soviets have refused, and acted in a way which
                            suggests a move toward an uninspected moratorium. We have had much
                            experience since 1945 with the difference between agreement in principle
                            and an actual agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Drozniak</persName> to
                            tell Minister <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> that we want
                            very much to have a test-ban treaty, that we are prepared to believe
                            that the Soviets also wish a treaty, and that we will continue to work
                            hard toward reaching agreement.</p>
                        <p>Turning to Berlin, the Secretary said that the key factor remains the
                            presence of Western forces, this not being negotiable. We believe that
                            relations between the parts of Germany and between Germany and Europe
                            can become more normal. We expect that there will be discussions with
                            the Soviets and we will see what happens. We see possibilities of
                            progress, but it will take patience, care and time. Asked by <persName
                                corresp="#p_DE1">Drozniak</persName> whether the Soviet proposal
                            concerning a UN presence—the UN flag—in Berlin did not offer a solution,
                            the Secretary commented that we have indications that this is not all
                            the Soviets have in mind, and that their statements on this subject have
                            not been consistent. Although we have not taken the matter up on an
                            inter-allied basis, we think it possible that a UN presence which would
                            insure a lessening of tensions throughout the Berlin area might be a
                            solution. Concerning denuclearization, the Secretary said that this must
                            be considered in the total framework of disarmament and basic issues in
                            Europe. In a sense, he said, technology has overtaken the <persName
                                corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> Plan. If the area proposed were
                            denuclearized, the Soviets would still have a massive capability. We
                            thus now face technical problems which make the idea of zones
                            doubtful.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said that there are other problems which concern
                            us—for example, Laos. We are disturbed by the lack of cooperation on the
                            part of the Pathet Lao with the Royal Laotian Government. We support
                            Souvanna Phouma and know that cooperation between him and Phoumi Nosavan
                            is good, but that there is tension between <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157"
                                facs="0179"/>Souvanna and the Pathet Lao.<note n="2" xml:id="d77fn2"
                                >Souvanna Phouma, Prime Minister of Laos, and General Phoumi
                                Nosavan, leader of the Laotian right wing. In August 1962 the
                                factions involved in the Laotian civil war, including the Communist
                                Pathet Lao, had attempted to carry out an agreement for the
                                withdrawal of foreign involvement and the peaceful settlement of
                                their differences. The settlement soon broke down.</note> It is
                            extremely important that the coalition succeed, it being a test case of
                            a personal agreement between President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                                >Kennedy</persName> and Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>. It is in the interests of both sides that
                            Laos be let alone. We have no influence with the Pathet Lao, and hope
                            that those who do will use it to prevail on them to support the
                            coalition.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that the role of Poland as a member of the
                            International Control Commission in Laos is important and that Poland
                            has a heavy responsibility. If there is not freedom of movement in Laos,
                            we must suspect what is going on. We hope that Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> will think about the
                            implications of the ICC’s acting in a way to reduce suspicion. The
                            Secretary added that we are not happy about an inspection of Air America
                            if many other things going on are not inspected.</p>
                        <p>Thanking the Secretary for his exposition, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DE1">Drozniak</persName> posed his second question.
                            What, he asked, does the Secretary see as the prospects for our
                            bilateral relations. The Poles are very much interested in developing
                            our relations in all fields. He was concerned at this time with our
                            economic relations and wondered what the chances were for reversing
                            Congressional action concerning most-favored-nation treatment for
                            Poland, for amendment of the Battle Act, for ending the boycott of
                            Polish goods in the US, and for future agreements under Public Law
                            480.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he would like to be completely frank, because it
                            is important that we understand each other. We are interested in
                            improving our bilateral relations. This is so for many reasons,
                            including the long history of ties between our countries. We are
                            interested despite the fact that Poland pursues policies in matters of
                            importance to us which we find disagreeable. However, we try to
                            understand Poland’s special situation including its geographic location.
                            If Poland were located elsewhere and pursued its policies, our relations
                            would be bad, but we take into account our understanding that Poland
                            does not have full control of its own situation. Unfortunately, the US
                            public and Congress do not have the same understanding of Poland’s
                            situation. The Secretary asked <persName corresp="#p_DE1"
                                >Drozniak</persName> to express to Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> his appreciation for <persName
                                corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName>’s understanding of our problems
                            as we try to understand Poland’s.</p>
                        <p>Concerning <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>, the Secretary said, the
                            President has made his position and his intention clear. The Secretary
                            added that he was not at <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0180"
                            />liberty to discuss tactics and that he could not guarantee success,
                            but that if the general atmosphere is favorable, he would be
                            hopeful.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that there are other things we might do to help our
                            relations. We should press ahead in the field of exchanges. We hope that
                            we can improve the channels of trade, although our role in that respect
                            is limited by the nature of our economic system. In general, we would
                            like to steer the boat of our relations in a favorable direction, but
                            the waters are sometimes choppy.</p>
                        <p>In response to a further question concerning how we see the future of
                            US-Polish PL 480 agreements in general, the Secretary noted that it had
                            been possible to conclude an agreement recently and believed that in the
                            absence of a change in the situation, there was no reason why we could
                            not have another look later.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Drozniak</persName> said that he
                            wanted to express his thanks for the Department’s active help with
                            regard to the boycott of Polish goods in the US and the threatened ILA
                            boycott of Polish ships.</p>

                            thank the Secretary. He said that the Foreign Minister was still

                        <p>The Ambassador went on to say that he had had an opportunity to discuss
                            Polish-United States relations with many ranking Polish officials,
                            including Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz and Party First Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName>, and that they had
                            listened carefully to what he had to report from Washington, knowing
                            that he had just come from having talks with a number of high United
                            States officials, including the Secretary. In this connection the
                            subjects that had interested the Polish leaders most included the
                            questions of disarmament and Germany, as well as specific matters of
                            US-Polish bilateral relations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary interjected apropos of this that we had been particularly
                            interested in recent progress made in Polish-West German relations, of
                            which the long-term trade agreement between the Federal Republic and
                            Poland was the prime evidence. The Ambassador replied that the latter
                            was evidence of the Polish Government’s readiness to try to achieve a
                            normalization of relations with the Federal Republic. He added that his
                            Government was concerned, however, over the general lack of progress in
                            the field of disarmament and settlement of related issues.</p>
                        <p>Concerning bilateral US-Polish relations, the Ambassador said that he had
                            discussed these in detail with his Government and was glad to say that
                            the latter had confirmed his mission of pursuing a policy of practical
                            coexistence in all fields. This was equally true, he said, with regard
                                <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0182"/>to cultural exchanges,
                            scientific exchanges, and economic relations with the United States. He
                            mentioned that the Polish Minister of Health had accepted an invitation
                            to visit the United States and was looking forward to coming soon.</p>
                        <p>Concerning specific economic relations, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DE1">Drozniak</persName> went on to say that Poland
                            would like to develop these relations on the basis of normal trade. He
                            said that there was concern in Poland, however, over the fact that the
                            question as to whether the United States would continue to give Poland
                            most-favored-nation tariff treatment had not yet been decided. He was
                            still in Poland, he added, when President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                                >Kennedy</persName> sent his message to Congress recommending
                            restoration of most-favored-nation treatment to Polish imports, in
                            connection with the Foreign Aid Bill,<note n="2" xml:id="d79fn2">For

                            received with satisfaction among the Polish Government, as had the
                            Secretary’s own statements on the subject at Congressional hearings. The
                            Ambassador said he would be grateful if he could hear the Secretary’s
                            comments on this problem. He also said that he had reported to his
                            Government in a quieting manner concerning the current boycott of Polish
                            goods in this country as well as the prospective longshoremen’s boycott
                            of Polish shipping, saying that he saw hopes that these problems would
                            be solved.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the economic situation in Poland, the Ambassador said that he
                            had been concerned about it before he returned to Poland and that he had
                            found it very bad owing to a severe winter and poor crops. For this
                            reason, he said, Poland would be very glad if it could enter into a new
                            agreement with the United States again this year, regarding purchase of
                            surplus agricultural commodities, and would be happy to have this in the
                            form of a mixed agreement as before, with both credit and cash purchases
                            included, an arrangement that appeals to the Polish Government. He asked
                            the Secretary whom he should first approach on this matter.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that the Ambassador should take this up with
                            Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName>. With
                            regard to the most-favored-nation question, he said that the
                            Administration had been in touch with members of the Congress and that
                            it was his impression that if the general situation remained relatively
                            calm the chances were good that the President’s proposals would succeed.
                            This, he added, was not because there had been an increase of enthusiasm
                            among Congress members for the proposals, but rather because some of the
                            opponents of trade with Poland might remain silent. The Secretary said
                            that he was moderately optimistic on this score.</p>

                        <p>A–873. Subject: Poland—Basic Policy. What are we trying to do in
                            Poland?</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that our basic purpose is to keep our foot in the door and
                            our shoulder against it. We want to have contacts with the Poles, to
                            make them feel our presence in Poland, to tempt them to try a somewhat
                            independent line toward the Soviet Union, to maintain Poland’s Western
                            cultural orientation, to make it more difficult for the Polish regime to
                            be too harsh toward the Polish people, to underscore our traditional
                            friendship and links with the Polish people. We want the Polish regime
                            to realize that it can open the door further if it wants: it is not
                            totally dependent on the Soviet Union and if it wishes better relations
                            with the United States it can have them and benefit from them. We must
                            engage the Poles on as many fronts as possible: tourism, publications,
                            radio broadcasting, cultural presentations, consular relations, travel
                            grants, trade, social gatherings, English teaching, cultural centers,
                                <gloss target="#t_CARE1">CARE</gloss> programs, films, public
                            appearances, libraries, schools, hospitals—in any area of contact that
                            we can keep open. To take a trivial example, it is surprising to note
                            the interest stirred up in any Polish town when the Ambassador’s
                            American car shows up with the American flag flying. Our opportunities
                            in Poland are matchless in the Soviet bloc and despite some setbacks we
                            have a good many successes to our credit. We must recognize, however,
                            that since the heady days of 1956 the general trend has been for the
                            Polish authorities to tighten the screw over Polish nationals rather
                            than loosen it further.</p>
                        <p>We must not fool ourselves as to what we can accomplish. We are not going
                            to change the essential character or orientation of the regime. It is
                            going to remain communist and it is going to maintain its adherence to
                            the Warsaw Pact. If it differs from other communist regimes in its
                            agricultural policy, its treatment of the church and the relatively
                            greater freedom it gives its citizens, this is not primarily because of
                            United States policy—it is due to domestic considerations. Important as
                            it is for us to take Poland’s special position and interests into
                            account, it is unlikely that we can induce Poland to adopt markedly more
                            favorable policies from our viewpoint no matter what we do. There is
                            even considerable question as to how far we might induce the regime to
                            adopt less favorable domestic policies if we ourselves were harder nosed
                            in our <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0184"/>dealings with it. In
                            short the communist regime in Poland is going its own way in accordance
                            with its own concepts of its interests. If from time to time it adjusts
                            its course somewhat to take our views and interests into account this is
                            primarily to get what it can out of us; we should emphatically not
                            deceive ourselves that there is anything really significant in it. All
                            that we can hope to accomplish in the foreseeable future is to influence
                            individuals, to create a favorable atmosphere, to chip away at the
                            crudities of communist dogma.</p>
                        <p>The principal instrument for implementation of our policy today is PL
                            480. Poland depends heavily on its ability to get grain and other
                            agricultural commodities from us on what in effect are extraordinarily
                            cheap long-term credit terms. The zlotys which it deposits in payment
                            for our commodities, though nominally subject to withdrawal, are not
                            going to be except in infinitesimal amounts, and the regime knows this.
                            Most of these zlotys will simply remain in Polish banks until, in ten to
                            forty years, they are due for reconversion into dollars. It is to be
                            borne in mind that these zlotys so far as the Polish Government is
                            concerned are therefore really nothing but an entry in a ledger.
                            Moreover when commodities are distributed to ultimate consumers, the
                            return flow of payments is deposited in currency. That currency can be
                            used either to fight ever-threatening inflation by sterilization or for
                            new credit operations. In a capitalist economy that would be a great
                            advantage. The economic section of the Embassy argues that in a
                            communist economy it is not, since the government always has the
                            totality of the nation’s resources, human and material, at its disposal
                            in any case. Be that as it may, there is another point which is
                            indisputable. Since there is no interest payable either on the zlotys or
                            on the dollars into which in due course they are to be reconverted, the
                            real value of what we are paid is a great deal less than the nominal
                            value. At the interest rate the United States Government pays on its
                            long term obligations, dollars payable, in an average of 25 years in the
                            future, are worth only a fraction of what dollars payable today are
                            worth—and this takes no account either of probable inflation or of the
                            possibility of default by the Polish Government. The benefit of all this
                            on the $477,000,000 of agricultural commodities we have sold to Poland
                            under PL 480 accrues to the Polish communist regime. It is no trifling
                            benefit, but just so much help to the regime to achieve its economic
                            objectives. In other words, if we are to extend material help which
                            importantly strengthens the communist bloc we should be very certain
                            that what we are receiving in return is worth as much to us as what
                            Poland is getting.</p>
                        <p>Although from our viewpoint these agricultural commodities are surpluses,
                            from the Polish viewpoint they are vital to the country’s economy. If
                            they were not to receive them, it would be necessary for the regime to
                            tighten the belt to the point where it would really pinch. It is <pb
                                n="163" xml:id="pg_163" facs="0185"/>clear that even with all the
                            help Poland has received from PL 480 its economy is seriously strained.
                            Foreign exchange reserves are very low and perhaps nonexistent. The
                            exceptionally cold winter has caused breakdowns in a number of sectors
                            of the economy. It is to be remembered that our agricultural commodities
                            supplied to Poland have not only helped to save Poland foreign exchange
                            but also (by providing feed for hogs, hens, etc.) have contributed
                            importantly to Poland’s foreign exchange earnings. The importance of PL
                            480 supplies to Poland is clear from many Polish statements.</p>
                        <p>Recognizing the inherent limitations on what we can hope to accomplish I
                            question whether it is necessary to enter into such large PL 480
                            agreements with Poland as we have customarily signed. Presumably we have
                            signed these large agreements because of other benefits which we have
                            secured in addition to keeping the door open. These include such matters
                            as the settlement of our claims, tie-in sales, etc. It was perhaps the
                            Department’s thought in raising the amount we offered the Poles in the
                            last negotiations that this was to mitigate the blow to our relations
                            which had been caused by Congress’ action with regard to <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>In implementation of our PL 480 policy one point we must bear constantly
                            in mind is the burden these agreements are going to place on the Polish
                            economy in years to come. Repayments under the PL 480 agreements in
                            dollars will start in 1967 and will rapidly build up as repayments under
                            one agreement after another begin to come due. It is somewhat doubtful
                            whether the Polish economy can bear the strain of these repayments,
                            particularly if Polish exports to the United States are prejudiced by
                            Congress’ action with regard to <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>, by
                                <persName>John Birch</persName> boycotts of Polish goods and by
                            similar measures. Presumably, therefore, it must be our policy to phase
                            out further agreements in due course. Every new agreement adds to the
                            hurdles which the Polish economy will have to surmount in the not too
                            distant future. The time may come, it may indeed already have come—when
                            it will be impossible for the Polish economy to surmount the hurdles
                            before it. Tempting though it may be at that point for Poland to
                            default, their record suggests that they will seek to avoid this way out
                            of their dilemma. Yet if we continue to sign large PL 480 agreements
                            over an extended period default might become unavoidable. At that point
                            we would face the unpleasant alternative of stretching our already
                            generous interest-free terms over a yet larger period or of losing much
                            of the good will we had so carefully built up over the years. Indeed, if
                            and when we stop signing new agreements and the Poles find they must
                            make heavy payments on old debts while securing no new benefits, they
                            probably will not like it. In short, we do not want our policy to be
                            self-defeating.</p>

                        <p>We cannot afford in our relations with Poland to take the attitude that
                            sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. It would almost certainly
                            be unwise to stop abruptly our series of PL 480 agreements with Poland.
                            On the other hand, it is essential from our viewpoint as well as that of
                            the Poles that Poland become more nearly self-sufficient in the near
                            future, at least in the commodities the country can produce. It is thus
                            the essence of good policy to cut down in the future on the size of any
                            PL 480 agreements we may sign. If we continue to sign modest sized
                            agreements covering, say, particularly cotton, which Poland cannot
                            produce, we can perhaps postpone a crisis indefinitely. If we continue
                            on our present course we are simply looking for trouble.</p>
                        <p>What are we going to expect in return from Poland?</p>
                        <p>We cannot expect specific political concessions. The Poles obviously are
                            not going to, and indeed cannot, accept such conditions. We can perhaps
                            expect as a consequence of further agreements that we will accomplish in
                            modest measure the intangible objectives mentioned in paragraph one but
                            this would be because the Polish authorities acquiesced in it rather
                            than through any agreement between our countries. It is simply not
                            realistic to expect any specific political concessions.</p>
                        <p>There are a number of economic concessions which we might ask. The most
                            important is perhaps a bond settlement, since the outstanding prewar
                            bonds of Poland remain in total default. Unfortunately, the Poles to all
                            appearances do not now have the foreign exchange to undertake a bond
                            settlement and, as explained in the previous discussion, there is no
                            strong reason to suppose they are going to have resources to undertake a
                            bond settlement within the foreseeable future. Possibly we could secure
                            a bond settlement by offering a large PL 480 agreement, much as we
                            obtained the claims settlement in 1960. We should continue to press for
                            a bond settlement but should not be unduly rigid in how we propose to
                            secure one.</p>
                        <p>Another concession which we have asked in the past and could with
                            propriety ask again in the future is that they make commercial purchases
                            of American agricultural commodities concomitantly with the purchases
                            they make under PL 480. This helps us to dispose of agricultural
                            commodities and to that extent is beneficial. I do think, however, that
                            we have more important objectives than this to attain in our relations
                            with Poland. The amount of commodities we thus dispose of is not very
                            large and it would seem to me that if we wanted to sell farm products to
                            Poland on a commercial basis it would be wise to go about doing this by
                            clearing away any legal and practical obstacles to commercial sales
                            rather than by making such sales a condition in future PL 480
                            agreements. There is surely no reason why we cannot compete both in
                            prices and credit terms with other sellers of agricultural products in
                            filling Poland’s large import requirements above her PL 480 purchases.
                                <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165" facs="0187"/>What we do want to remember
                            is that the extra commodities we sell them under PL 480 in order to make
                            the whole transaction, including tie-in sales, attractive, are really
                            important help to Poland’s economic development. I doubt it is wise to
                            do this in order to pocket a few dollars.</p>
                        <p>In our relations with Poland we are constantly being annoyed by petty
                            holdups. The deposit rate we can obtain, for example, is only 24 to 1
                            and, since this greatly overvalues the zloty, it means that all of our
                            expenses in Poland are greatly magnified. The Polish Government through
                            the PKO Bank will pay Polish residents 72 zlotys for dollars which they
                            bring in—in other words, Poland grossly discriminates against foreign
                            residents of Poland. The black market rate is reported to be about 80 to
                            1. The artificially low official rate for zlotys means not only that our
                            operating expenses are much increased but also that any capital
                            expenditures such as those for building are greatly augmented. It has
                            been argued that we should use the leverage of our PL 480 agreements to
                            get the Poles to give us a more favorable deposit rate under our PL 480
                            agreements and thereby a more favorable rate for our expenditures. This
                            argument is reinforced by the fact that we are selling grain to Poland,
                            taking the 24 to 1 rate of deposit, at a considerably lower price than
                            the domestic price for compulsory delivery of grain and at a far lower
                            price than the free market price.</p>
                        <p>There can be no question but that this is a proper matter to include in
                            PL 480 negotiations; the rate of deposit is an essential provision in
                            all of these agreements and the matter has specifically been discussed
                            on at least one previous occasion. Nevertheless, I am inclined to feel
                            that this should be discussed separately rather than in the course of
                            any future PL 480 negotiations. The advantages to securing a higher
                            deposit rate would not be very large. When the time for reconversion
                            came we would get the same number of dollars for our zlotys regardless
                            of the deposit rate. The only difference would be that, with a higher
                            deposit rate, we would do relatively better on our operating expenses
                            and capital costs (even here we might find that the Polish Government in
                            its monopoly position might simply raise prices for us). There is no
                            reason, moreover, to suppose that this use of zlotys would run to more
                            than a relatively small proportion of the total amounts involved in our
                            PL 480 agreements.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, I think we would run a real risk that the Poles would
                            refuse altogether to enter into a further PL 480 agreement if we were to
                            insist on a higher deposit rate. Of course this danger could be
                            mitigated by offering them large amounts of PL 480 commodities or
                            otherwise more favorable terms but, as explained above, I would consider
                            it imprudent to continue negotiating PL 480 agreements for large amounts
                            of commodities. We are not in the position we were in the midst of the
                            negotiations last December for a PL 480 agreement. I believe <pb n="166"
                                xml:id="pg_166" facs="0188"/>the Embassy should be instructed to
                            protest this discrimination, but that this should not now be directly
                            linked with PL 480.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, the question of the Ellender amendment requires
                            consideration. As the Embassy has so often pointed out, this amendment
                            grossly favors the <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> and enables it to
                            gouge every United States Government agency operating in Poland by
                            forcing them in effect to exchange their current dollars for the <gloss
                                target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss>’s dollars, which are payable only many
                            years hence without interest. The American taxpayer does not lose by
                            this but the real cost of our programs in Poland is distorted out of all
                            recognition. By accepting deferred payments for our surplus commodities
                            we secure in effect a greatly reduced amount for them. We should not
                            turn this around and claim that our programs in Poland cost us fantastic
                            amounts more than they really do. It does make a great difference to
                            State, and to a lesser degree to other agencies, to spend over twice
                            what it should for its operations in Poland. The Ellender amendment
                            should be modified so that the real rather than the nominal value of the
                                <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss>’s money will be reflected by the
                            rate at which it sells to other agencies.</p>
                        <p>I think that considerations very similar to those mentioned regarding the
                            deposit rate should prevail in regard to at least two other economic
                            grievances we are suffering from. The City of Warsaw owns all real
                            estate within the city limits and will only allow foreign governments
                            and private individuals to enter into long-term leases for the use of
                            land. Land so leased is preposterously expensive and, since the city has
                            a monopoly of it, there is no recourse. We have been compelled to pay a
                            ridiculous sum (at least nominally) for an eighty-year lease on the land
                            on which it is proposed to build the Ambassador’s residence, and an even
                            more ridiculous sum has been asked for land for our prospective
                            school.</p>
                        <p>I believe that we should vigorously protest this holdup (since it can be
                            only so characterized) but I do not believe that we should tie it in
                            with PL 480. Again the game is simply not worth the candle. If we are
                            going to let a member of the Warsaw bloc have nearly half a billion
                            dollars worth of agricultural surpluses in order to achieve the benefits
                            mentioned at the beginning of this report, we certainly do not want to
                            be so nearsighted as to gag because we are held up for some hundreds of
                            thousands of dollars for land. We also do not want to encourage the
                            Polish Government to hold us up in order to be thereafter bribed to
                            cancel the holdup.</p>
                        <p>The same reasoning applies, I believe, to another holdup, which is in
                            connection with housing. Housing is extremely tight in Warsaw. The
                            Embassy must get quarters for its staff either from the city or from
                            private owners. The city a year ago increased its rents for foreign
                            diplomats several fold and moreover insisted that they in effect be paid
                            in foreign <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0189"/>currency. (This was
                            to prevent diplomats from using black market zlotys.) With regard to
                            private owners the city collects 85% of the nominal rental, which means
                            that rentals are extremely high. I believe that we should vigorously
                            protest this situation also but I agree with what I understand the
                            Department’s position to be, that it would be inappropriate to inject
                            this directly into PL 480 negotiations. The possibility of building
                            Embassy housing has been discussed in another Embassy report. It should
                            be added that we have just discovered that the Polish authorities will
                            not permit us to buy existing houses from private owners.</p>
                        <p>We have numerous cultural objectives which we should like to attain. Most
                            important among these is perhaps the establishment of a cultural center
                            which would be a focus for the teaching of the English language and the
                            dissemination of American culture among the people of Poland. Desirable
                            as it would be to establish such a center, I fear it is not within the
                            realm of practical possibilities under present circumstances. We could
                            scarcely demand the right to establish such a center as a quid pro quo
                            in our PL 480 negotiations since the Poles would doubtless strongly
                            reject such an approach. On the other hand, the Poles are not going to
                            permit the establishment of such a center out of the goodness of their
                            hearts. Yet I see no harm in making an approach on it at a suitable time
                            in the future. Although we would not link the center to PL 480, it is
                            not improbable that the Polish decision on it would be influenced by
                            their continued need for PL 480 assistance. An appropriate moment to
                            raise this question might be when (and if) the Congress accepts the
                            President’s recent recommendation regarding <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >MFN</gloss>. Also, short of establishing such a center there are
                            certain areas where considerable amounts of PL 480 zloty holdings of the
                            United States Government could be profitably employed in stimulating the
                            quantity and quality of English language instruction in Poland. The
                            Embassy’s views on this matter were submitted to the Department in
                            detail in A–660 of February 22, 1963.<note n="1" xml:id="d80fn1">Airgram

                        <p>We should also like to see increased cultural exchanges between the
                            United States and Poland. There are at the moment rather numerous such
                            cultural exchanges, which I shall not enumerate in this report. On the
                            other hand, as the Department is aware, the Polish authorities are
                            forever putting a spoke in our cultural wheel. The Glenn capsule was in

                            The circulation of American books, periodicals and newspapers in Poland
                            is restricted. It is clear that whereas the Polish authorities are
                            willing to have the cultural door <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168"
                                facs="0190"/>slightly opened, they are determined to keep their foot
                            firmly against it in order that it may not swing so far open as to be
                            inconvenient from their standpoint. Here again I feel that there is
                            nothing we can do except to protest as individual cases arise. We
                            certainly cannot inject the question of specific cultural exchanges into
                            PL 480 negotiations.</p>
                        <p>In short, I believe that we should not enter into large PL 480 agreements
                            with Poland except possibly under circumstances which cannot now be
                            foreseen. We should try to enter into modest agreements varying
                            annually, in conformity with the cooperation we have received from the
                            Polish authorities in the preceding year, with no strings except
                            adequate publicity attached. We should not insist on tie-in sales since
                            we want the offers we make to be so attractive that the Poles will
                            almost certainly accept them faute de mieux and yearn for more. We
                            should sweep away any legal obstacles to the purchase by Poland of
                            agricultural commodities under competitive conditions as to prices and
                            credit terms with other producers.</p>
                        <p>We should not wish to extend really significant help to a government
                            which has consistently made its hostility to us clear. We should
                            continue to give that government material assurance that if it adopts a
                            more friendly attitude we will respond in kind. Our relative
                            friendliness to them as expressed by our deeds should correspond to
                            their relative friendliness to us. If they choose to be a member of a
                            hostile bloc and yet continue to show some signs of friendliness to us
                            we should be forthcoming in extending limited help to them. If they are
                            more friendly we should be more friendly. They should always feel that
                            they have something to lose by too negative an attitude towards us. They
                            should equally feel that if they want better relations we will welcome
                            this within the bounds of prudence. We have historic ties and we wish to
                            preserve them. Our people are friendly towards each other and it would
                            be a tragedy of history if we were ever to clash. We must not give the
                            impression we shall always be friendly and helpful regardless of what
                            they do. But we must—always—make it clear that if they want good
                            relations that is precisely what we want, too.</p>
                        <p>There are, of course, other ways in addition to PL480 by which we might
                            influence the Poles of the Polish Government. An obvious example of this
                            is the possibility of our recognizing the Oder-Neisse line as permanent.
                            Doubtless the Polish Government would make concessions for a move of
                            this nature on our part. However, since Germany is more important to us
                            than Poland and since Germany is an ally and Poland is a member of a
                            hostile bloc, this would be scarcely advisable.</p>
                        <p>A present irritant in our relations with Poland is the question of <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>. Congress has directed that this be
                            withdrawn from Poland (and Yugoslavia) as soon as practicable. The
                            President has not, as yet, acted on this and has recommended that this
                            provision be repealed. The Polish <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169"
                                facs="0191"/>Government has claimed (and from the record, I think it
                            is pretty clear that their claim is justified) that the extension of
                                <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> to Poland in 1960 was part of a
                            general agreement by which, among other things, Poland agreed to pay 40
                            million dollars, in annual installments of 2 million dollars, in
                            compensation for our claims for the American property which Poland
                            nationalized.</p>
                        <p>Quite apart from the moral commitment which I believe we have toward
                            Poland in this regard, I think it would be definitely unwise from a
                            practical standpoint for us to cancel <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >MFN</gloss> for Poland. I think it probable that if we do cancel
                                <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>, Poland will default on the
                            Claims Agreement—indeed in conversations and even in notes the Polish
                            Government has strongly intimated that it would do this. There is even
                            danger that it might affect the reconversion of PL 480 zlotys to
                            dollars. It would cause an unfortunate cooling in relations between
                            Poland and the United States and to that extent prejudice the position
                            which we have been so painfully and expensively building up in this
                            country. I therefore strongly hope that Congress will accept the
                            President’s recommendation.</p>
                        <p>My predecessor in his Despatch 344 of January 13, 1961<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d80fn2">Not printed. (Ibid., 611.48/1–1361)</note>
                            recommended the repeal of the Battle Act with regard to Poland,
                            evidently with the thought in mind that this would permit us to extend
                            help to Poland in strictly nonmilitary fields in which we too would
                            derive some benefit, such as research, cultural centers and possibly
                            hospitals and similar projects. I am strongly in favor of finishing the
                            Children’s Hospital at Krakow. Yet with the benefit of two years
                            hindsight I question the present advisability of thus repealing the
                            Battle Act. I do not believe that Congress would go along with such
                            repeal. Quite apart from this, I do not think, so long as present
                            circumstances prevail (and there is no reason to suppose that they will
                            change) that we should extend grant aid to Poland. It has been argued
                            that building public facilities would absorb scarce materials and
                            skilled labor much needed in other sectors of this very tight economy
                            even though no direct American interest were advanced. But after all,
                            even the building of any public facilities however innocuous and
                            humanitarian would relieve the Polish Government of the necessity of
                            building them and would release the Polish Government of foreign debits,
                            thereby making it possible for the country to import more from abroad
                            for economic and perhaps military development.</p>
                        <p>We do want the Polish Government to feel that relatively good relations
                            with the United States are beneficial from Poland’s viewpoint. We <pb
                                n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0192"/>do want them to conclude that
                            there is a clear if indirect connection between what they do and the
                            relative benefits they receive from us. We do want them to feel that the
                            door is open and can be opened wider. We do want to use every
                            opportunity we perceive to “engage” them, to establish more and closer
                            contacts with them, to make our presence felt, to extend our influence,
                            to disseminate our thinking. But we do not, I submit, want to give a
                            member of the Warsaw Pact really significant material help.</p>

                            political standpoint, with result that international events often
                            resulted in postponement of negotiations. This made planning difficult
                            and strengthened position those elements in Poland who argued that
                            dependence on US agricultural surplusses dangerous because of
                            uncertainty. Raised point (as did Ochab) that of those countries
                            receiving PL–480 only Poland obliged repay in dollars, although forced
                            admit terms were generous. Regretted that “legal obstacles” (presumably
                            referring <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> Act) made it
                            impossible for Poland purchase more agricultural commodities on normal
                            commercial terms. Predicted Poland would be grain importer until at

                        <p>On boycott, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> said
                            that while position taken by Administration and President himself

                        <p>306. It is perhaps not necessary for me to remind Department of
                            importance I attach to <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> in connection
                            with American-Polish relations. Polish Government has given strong
                            indications it will cancel claims agreement if we cancel <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>, and considering undeniable connection
                            which exists between these two agreements I scarcely think they could be
                            blamed if they acted in this manner. This means that cancellation of
                                <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> will cost us $34 million. I also
                            feel that this is scarcely the moment to disregard a moral
                            commitment.</p>
                        <p>There are distinct signs of improvement in our relations stemming
                            largely, I believe, from test ban agreement.<note n="1" xml:id="d82fn1"
                                >For text of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, signed in Moscow on August
                                5 and entered into force on October 10, see TIAS 5433.</note>
                            Publicity in connection with inauguration of tinning mill was definitely
                            favorable. There are reports that Polish media have been instructed to
                            play down attacks on US and also that Thee is being withdrawn from Laos.
                            It would therefore, in my mind, be the more unfortunate at this time to
                            hit Poles grieviously on <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Should Congress insist on cancelling <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>
                            despite the President’s recommendation I suggest that Department be
                            ready immediately to inform Polish Government that we are prepared to
                            enter into PL–480 negotiations. This would at least indicate to Polish
                            Government that we wish our special relations to continue. In this
                            connection I reiterate my recommendation that we endeavor to repeal
                            legislative obstacles to sale of agricultural commodities on credit.</p>

                        <p>404. I am seriously disturbed by information received by our military
                            attache that basic decision has been reached in Washington to require
                            prior notification and permission and detailed itineraries for all
                            travel in US by satellite attaches. Others are obviously better
                            qualified than I to comment on military advantages and disadvantages of
                            proposed move. Nevertheless, given Poland’s geographic position and
                            relative liberty to travel our attaches now enjoy, I question whether
                            imposition of proposed regulations (which will probably be imposed
                            reciprocally on our attaches) will be to our net advantage. At time of
                            Cuba crisis last year, it was surely of vital importance to Washington
                            to know that we observed no evidence of unusual military traffic across
                            Poland. If satellite attache aware [<hi rend="italic">were</hi>?] barred
                            from relatively smaller areas, I question whether Poles would retaliate
                            since they bar our attaches from small areas, but provised [<hi
                                rend="italic">provisory</hi>?] regulations are another matter. Also
                            this seems to me poor time to make another move which Poles can only
                            consider inimical. It will probably be taken as evidence we have changed
                            our basic policy towards Poland and may precipitate descending spiral
                            which I have heard [<hi rend="italic">feared</hi>?]. I suggest
                            Department take this up with <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> to be
                            sure at least that they have considered adequately unfortunate
                            repercussions which this move would almost certainly precipitate in
                            Poland.</p>

                                desk.<note n="1" xml:id="d84fn1"><persName corresp="#p_RA1"
                                    >Rapacki</persName> returned to his duties as Foreign Minister
                                on July 1.</note> Although the Foreign Minister had wanted to attend
                            this month’s opening UN session, he was advised against it for health
                            reasons, and Deputy Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJ1"
                                >Winiewicz</persName> will head the Polish delegation.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Drozniak</persName> then explained
                            that he had been in Poland for two months of vacation, but had also had
                            opportunity for business talks with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GW1"
                                >Gomulka</persName>, President Zawadzki, Prime Minister
                            Cyrankiewicz, and Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_RA1"
                                >Rapacki</persName>. As for the internal economic situation, this
                            year’s short period of vegetation, owing to a late spring, coupled with
                            drought conditions in midsummer, had resulted in a crop expected to
                            approximate that of the previous year. Harvest prospects were neither
                            very good nor very bad, as indicated in <persName corresp="#p_GW1"
                                >Gomulka</persName>’s harvest speech on September 8. After a
                            disastrous winter, sandwiched between two poor harvests, Poland was now
                            beginning to catch its breath and get moving again, although the tasks
                            ahead are not easy ones.</p>
                        <p>Concerning international relations, the Ambassador said the Polish people
                            and official circles were enthusiastic over the recently concluded
                            nuclear test-ban treaty and hoped this first step will lead to other
                            relaxations of world tension and possible new agreements. In this
                            atmosphere he had received instructions to work toward the development
                            of bilateral relations in the direction of peaceful coexistence, and he
                            wished to remind the Secretary that Poland was the only Warsaw Pact
                            country that has already been working in this spirit for several years.
                            He wanted <pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0197"/>to continue this
                            work, emphasizing the economic relationship between the two
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Drozniak</persName> said that his
                            government entertains strong hopes that the question of <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> treatment will be resolved in the near
                            future since unfortunate effects upon Polish trade are already being
                            felt. He cited the attitude of US businessmen who have doubts as to the
                            future of <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> and the hesitancy of
                            Polish foreign trade firms to make future commitments for the same
                            reason. It would be an unfortunate situation indeed if the withdrawal of
                                <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> were to occur and bring about a
                            loss of much of the good progress made between the two countries during
                            the last few years. He explained that if he and the Poles sometimes
                            appeared to show impatience on the question of <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >MFN</gloss>, it was because of the importance they attach to
                            it.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then raised the question of negotiations for Polish
                            purchase in this country of PL 480 grain. He was referring to an
                            agreement similar to that of February 1, 1963—i.e., one, a part under
                            which would be procured for cash, the rest for local currencies with
                            eventual repayment in dollars. He pointed out that although obligated on
                            February 1 to buy for cash only 200,000 tons of American grain, Poland
                            had already purchased over 400,000 tons from the US, a fact over which
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> had expressed
                            his satisfaction in Warsaw. Poland anticipates that it must import about
                            2.5 million tons of foreign grain annually for several years to come,
                            and it must plan on satisfying these requirements from several countries
                            offering a source of supply. He referred to a conversation in Warsaw on
                            September 6 between Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJ1"
                                >Cabot</persName> and Foreign Trade Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_TW1">Trampczynski</persName>,<note n="2" xml:id="d84fn2"
                                    ><persName corresp="#p_CJ1">Cabot</persName> reported on
                                discussions with <persName corresp="#p_TW1">Trampczynski</persName>
                                in telegram 463 from Warsaw, September 6. (Department of State,
                                Central Files, <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> (US)

                            are so important to the Poles that they are willing to initiate cash
                            purchases now, if the US can give some indication regarding the
                            approximate amount of PL 480 sales envisaged. He recalled that in June
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName> had indicated that an
                            answer to the Polish request would be forthcoming at the end of the
                            summer. The Poles like to feel that summer is over already. He closed
                            his presentation by saying he would be grateful if the Secretary could
                            comment on the state of general bilateral relations and more
                            particularly on the two specific problems he had raised.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1"
                                >Drozniak</persName> doubtless would be raising these questions in
                            more detail with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName>.
                            Moreover, he himself might have to see the Ambassador again soon since
                            other commitments of his time might prevent him from saying all he
                            wished today. He too characterized the test-ban treaty as an indication
                                <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0198"/>of progress. The
                            possibility of further progress depended upon whether some points on
                            which the US and other Western nations are willing to move ahead can be
                            found which coincide with those on which the USSR is willing to move.
                            Nevertheless, the Secretary conceded a general improvement in the
                            atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>Regarding <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>, the Secretary stated that
                            Congress has not yet acted. He believed the Ambassador was aware of the
                            Administration’s standpoint. In confidence, he referred to closed
                            Congressional committee sessions on the <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >MFN</gloss> question, during which representatives of Congress have
                            expressed reservations regarding Polish actions in Laos. As the US
                            watches developments in Laos, it does not feel that the Polish ICC
                            representative is acting in the spirit of the Geneva accords, and
                            naturally this has a bad effect on US attitudes toward <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> treatment of Poland. The Secretary
                            pointed out, again in confidence, that there in fact are some persons in
                            Congress willing to move on <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> for
                            Yugoslavia, but not for Poland, and principally because of events in
                            Laos. While in Moscow recently, he had the impression that Moscow was
                            more relaxed regarding Laos than was the Polish ICC representative
                            himself. He said he felt further that Mr. <persName>Thee</persName> was
                            more responsive to attitudes in Hanoi and Peiping than were the Moscow
                            leaders.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Drozniak</persName> interposed to
                            comment that while developments during the first half of this year may
                            have caused some in the US to feel this way, he had not seen or heard
                            any adverse comments regarding Mr. <persName>Thee</persName> since his
                            recall to Warsaw in June and subsequent return to Laos.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary rejoined that he had expressed his encouragement over Mr.
                                <persName>Thee</persName>’s attitude to Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DE1">Drozniak</persName> prior to the latter’s departure
                            for Warsaw only to find on his desk after the conversation a cable
                            concerning the Polish ICC representative which nearly prompted him in
                            anger to telephone the Ambassador to take back his earlier remark.</p>
                        <p>As for PL 480, the Secretary said the question requires some further
                            thinking on the part of the US, although he agreed that the Poles
                            deserve an answer to their request in the near future. He inquired as to
                            the status of the February 1963 agreement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dobrosielski</persName> explained that all sales and
                            deliveries had been completed. Furthermore, talks on that agreement had
                            been initiated in June 1962, but the agreement had been delayed by the
                            long deliberations in Congress over the Trade Expansion Act; otherwise,
                            there would have been a 1962 agreement instead of the one in February
                            1963.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that the question of PL 480 sales was affected by
                            other considerations. The Foreign Aid Bill would not come before
                            Congress before October. He also indicated technical problems the <pb
                                n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0199"/>Department still has to think
                            about, all of which prevented him from giving an answer today. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName> confirmed that we are
                            actively considering the question and hope to give the Ambassador an
                            answer soon.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Drozniak</persName> acknowledged
                            the existing difficulties, but reiterated his government’s interest in
                            obtaining some indication of approximate amounts under a new agreement,
                            particularly since Poland is ready to initiate cash purchases. He
                            pointed out that credit terms for commercial sales of US wheat were less
                            favorable than those obtainable from countries like Canada and France.
                            Polish foreign currency assets are limited, and it is necessary to keep
                            close account of the balance. Since certain amounts must be allocated
                            for US purchases, the Poles desired to commence these purchases as soon
                            as possible.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary offered to see whether anything could be done in
                            anticipation of negotiations that would have the effect of shortening
                            their duration when they did take place. He agreed to study the matter
                            carefully and to discuss it with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1"
                                >Freeman</persName>.</p>

                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJ1">Winiewicz</persName> called on the
                            Secretary during the course of a brief trip to Washington from New York,
                            where he was heading the Polish <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>
                            Delegation.</p>
                        <p>Following a lengthy discussion of events in Laos and Vietnam, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WJ1">Winiewicz</persName> took up US-Polish
                            relations, which he described as of prime importance to Poland. Poland’s
                            wish was to improve relations and <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178"
                                facs="0200"/>achieve closer cooperation, so long as this did not
                            involve any sacrifice of Polish principles. He cited as an example of
                            the imposition of unacceptable political conditions the press tie-in
                            last May of US demands for the recall of ICC Commissioner Thee with
                            Polish requests for a new PL 480 agreement. The new negotiations for
                            grain credit under PL 480 posed similar problems. Whereas Poland treated
                            PL 480 purchases as it does any normal commercial transaction and
                            planned to repay its dollar obligations on schedule, the negotiations
                            for each such agreement drag on for essentially political reasons.
                                <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> to Poland, restored in 1960, had
                            been in jeopardy since 1962, making shaky at best the foundation for
                            normal trade relations. He said the appeal, signed by the President on
                            October 25, for contributions to Radio Free Europe was another incident
                            that had aroused enormous indignation within his government.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d85fn1">For text of the statement, see <hi rend="italic"

                                814.</note> Finally, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJ1"
                                >Winiewicz</persName> referred to press rumors of forthcoming travel
                            restrictions for Polish diplomats in the US. This would surely provoke a
                            strong negative reaction in Poland, since, other than for service
                            attaches, no restrictions had ever been imposed on diplomats in Poland,
                            not even during the cold war period, except for certain areas along the
                            Polish-Soviet frontier. He urged that a distinction be made by the US
                            for travel of diplomats, as opposed to attaches. The Poles are proud of
                            their policy of unrestricted travel throughout their country and would
                            hate to be forced to impose restrictions now.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stressed the need to discuss US-Polish relations within the
                            total political framework. The US knows, he said, that Poland’s world
                            position is governed by some limitations over which it has no control.
                            The US also knows that ideological differences between the two countries
                            are not going to be eliminated by negotiation. On the other hand, there
                            is a strong favorable sentiment for Poland within the US, where even the
                            Polish-American community, though opposed to the present Polish regime,
                            favors granting of <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> to Poland. As for
                            PL 480, he said, a problem arises when Poland goes to other world
                            markets to buy grain on commercial terms, while expecting the US to
                            provide grain under the interest-free 40-year repayment terms of PL
                            480.</p>
                        <p>Asked what had gone wrong since the Secretary’s cordial talks with
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> in Geneva
                            in March 1962, the Secretary replied that if the Russians would agree to
                            raise no questions as to the size and right of existence of Allied
                            military forces in Berlin until a final German settlement is negotiated,
                            it would render manageable all the other aspects of the problem. When
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJ1">Winiewicz</persName> indicated Polish
                            worries over possible German acquisition of nuclear weapons, the
                            Secretary assured <pb n="179" xml:id="pg_179" facs="0201"/>him that it
                            is in the very nature of nuclear weapons that those nations having them
                            do not want others to have them. Hence, the US was opposed to their
                            proliferation. The proposed multilateral force would not transfer
                            nuclear weapons to any national government, nor permit any national
                            government independently to determine when they would be employed. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WJ1">Winiewicz</persName> again thanked the
                            Secretary for the meeting in taking his leave.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> explained that he had
                            called in the Ambassador to present a note establishing restrictions on
                            the travel within the US of all officials of Eastern European countries
                            who are assigned here.<note n="1" xml:id="d86fn1">For texts of the U.S.
                                statement announcing the restrictions, the U.S. notes to individual
                                countries, and a list of U.S. counties closed to travel, see
                                Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, December 2,
                                1963, pp. 860–863.</note> The note specifies that some 12–13% of the
                            area of the conterminous US is henceforth closed to travel for reasons
                            of safeguarding national security. Commercial air and train travel would
                            not be affected, all principal cities remain open for visiting, and two
                            cross-country automobile highways remain open to assure automobile
                            access to the Pacific coast.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> pointed out that there
                            had hitherto been a lack of equal opportunity for travel of US officials
                            and those of other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries
                            within the USSR, as opposed to the unrestricted access to all portions
                            of the US by officials of Warsaw Pact countries other than the Soviet
                            Union. He elaborated in further detail the heartland concept as it
                            applied to USSR and the US, respective military leaders of the Warsaw
                            Pact and <pb n="180" xml:id="pg_180" facs="0202"/><gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> alliances. For these reasons, he
                            said, the US reluctantly can no longer disregard its own national
                            interests, and the new system of travel controls had been devised. He
                            requested voluntary observance of the new limitations, since no
                            requirement for prior notification of proposed travel would be imposed
                            by the US. He made clear that when the USSR relaxes its present travel
                            controls on Western officials, the US would be happy to negotiate
                            similar modifications in its own system.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Drozniak</persName>, in accepting
                            the note, first disclaimed his authority to speak on behalf of all the
                            Warsaw Pact countries. He said that as a Pole, however, he received the
                            news with concern and dissatisfaction. He was convinced that his
                            government and Polish public opinion would react similarly upon receipt
                            of the news, since Poland had imposed no restrictions on travel of
                            Western diplomats, not even during the coldest period of the cold war.
                            He reserved the right to reply at a later date after studying the note
                            and receiving the views of his government. Personally, the Ambassador
                            thought that similar restrictions might have to be imposed upon travel
                            in Poland of US diplomats, and possibly also upon the officials of other
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries. In any event, he
                            felt that the step would be interpreted as a cold war action, rather
                            than as a step toward easing of tension.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> explained that the
                            area of the US closed to travel of Eastern European officials was only
                            half that closed to Soviet officials, and that it approximated that area
                            in Warsaw Pact countries presently closed for Western travel. For this
                            reason, he said he did not believe that additional retaliatory control
                            measures were justified.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Drozniak</persName> replied that
                            since no Polish territory was presently closed to US personnel or to
                            anyone else, failure to retaliate could only reflect discredit on
                            Poland’s dignity as a sovereign nation.</p>

                            policy for relations with Poland on reasonably sound foundations. During
                            this protracted period over-riding importance <pb n="181"
                                xml:id="pg_181" facs="0203"/><gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> and
                            uncertainty re congressional action have made policy formulation almost
                            impossible. On one hand we have been unable pursue effectively such
                            matters as bond settlement and removal of Thee from Laos, not to mention
                            numerous minor grievances. On other hand it has been difficult to know
                            how far to go, for example with regard to PL–480, in our efforts further
                            special relations which we have steadily tried since 1956 to establish
                            with Poland.</p>
                        <p>With <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> question settled, I hope that a
                            new PL 480 agreement for approximately 30 million dollars will soon be
                            concluded with Poland. I recommend that we do not offer larger amount
                            than this even though I expect Poles will strongly seek more. If
                            Department Agriculture insists, I would not object to our requiring
                            tie-in sales. However I would urge that in addition we make every effort
                            facilitate availability of competitive credit terms for Poles and I
                            think they will then buy more from us in fact than they would be willing
                            to commit themselves to buy in an agreement.</p>
                        <p>Outstanding issue between us today which might now be negotiable is
                            presumably question of Polish defaulted bonds. I have not pursued this
                            in recent months since <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> uncertainties
                            obviously impinged on Polish ability to service this Department. I
                            believe I should now raise this matter again. In their present economic
                            difficulties Poles will almost certainly refuse to assume these
                            obligations and I do not think we should insist just yet, for example,
                            on refusing further PL 480 transactions (I do feel, however, that this
                            remains unfinished business). I also think Poles should be reminded in
                            any PL 480 negotiations that it is difficult to see how they can assume
                            new obligations if they are unable to meet old ones in not dissimilar
                            amounts.</p>
                        <p>Question of travel restrictions in Poland (presuming we reject their
                            request for reconsideration of ours) might be taken in connection with
                            PL 480 agreement but I do not recommend this. My feeling is that we
                            would either pay too high a price for what we get or run the risk that
                            Poles would reject whole deal with disastrous effects on what we are
                            seeking to accomplish in this country. Department is of course aware
                            Poles are very sensitive with regard to attaching any political
                            conditions to PL 480 deals.</p>
                        <p>We can scarcely attach any conditions with regard to actions of any new
                            Polish ICC representative in Laos in connection with PL 480 agreement.
                            Should, however, Polish Commissioner’s actions be subject to justified
                            exception on our part, we should be now in stronger position object to
                            them.</p>
                        <p>In regard firmly expressed Polish intentions seek reciprocity regarding
                            travel restrictions, I feel that they [<hi rend="italic">we</hi>?] would
                            be prepared show Poles concretely that reciprocity is two-way street.
                            One way do this would be by abolishing immunities for Polish White List
                            personnel. <pb n="182" xml:id="pg_182" facs="0204"/>However, quite apart
                            from legal difficulties Department has previously mentioned in this
                            regard, I see some disadvantages to such move. It would abolish
                            precarious protection we have been able to secure for our own
                            non-commissioned personnel here. It might result in Polish retaliation
                            against us in sectors where we are vulnerable, for example by stopping
                            Embassy support or by restricting free entry privileges. On other hand,
                            it might, in view of fact that Poles gave commissioned officers in
                            non-commissioned positions in Washington, make our travel restrictions
                            more effective since any improper activities of their White List
                            personnel after immunity was cancelled might result in legal measures
                            against their non-commissioned personnel for such activities. I am
                            inclined to think that this is card we should hold and play later if
                            desirable.</p>
                        <p>If Poles establish travel restrictions in retaliation, I believe that I
                            should be instructed to argue with them various matters in which we have
                            been subjected to unfair and discriminatory treatment. Pole can go to
                            PKO and get 72 zloties for his dollar whereas foreigners can get only
                            24. In Washington Polish Government and its employees can buy or lease
                            land, houses or apartments on competitive market without securing
                            permission from US Government. In Warsaw we can secure these only from
                            what amounts to a government monopoly and at extortionate prices. I do
                            not expect Poles would give us any satisfaction in these matters and I
                            do not recommend severe pressure on them to that end. My thought is that
                            we should keep before Poles fact that we have legitimate grievances in
                            order to put us in better posture re action other matters as occasion
                            arises.</p>
                        <p>Polish officials can still travel over most of the US and meet with
                            Americans in seminars and round-table discussions, can deliver speeches
                            on any subject, and are generally unimpeded in making their presence
                            felt in US. In Poland we are perfectly aware that such contacts between
                            Poles and American officials are prevented by Polish authorities.</p>
                        <p>We have not heard whether any final decision has been reached with regard
                            possible retaliation against Poles for unjustified expulsion our two
                            attaches last fall. Should Poles retaliate by establishing travel
                            restrictions on US officials in Poland, I am inclined to think that it
                            would now be advisable to expel some Polish officer against whom there
                            is some evidence in retaliation for Polish action. This might of course
                            precipitate further retaliation on their part and might start descending
                            spiral of relations. I am inclined to think however that effect would be
                            to remind Poles that strict reciprocity is not necessarily best basis
                            for conducting international relations, while not sufficiently annoying
                            them to precipitate undesirable repercussions. It is of course most
                            important not to precipitate descending spiral in our relations but
                            experience suggests <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0205"/>to me that
                            Polish Communists react better to prudent firmness than to
                            flabbiness.</p>
                        <p>I think I should also remind Foreign Office that we have yet to hear
                            anything from them on our proposed consular convention despite several
                            followups on our part. We surmise Poles may have wished to see in which
                            direction our relations would turn or what would happen in our consular
                            negotiations with Soviets before replying to our proposals.</p>

                            by Congolese people. To this end United Nations mandate should be
                            strengthened and all assistance given through UNO channels. (He made no

                            help compose difficulties rather than increase tension during his trip.
                            Of course he must speak out against colonialism but he would not attack
                            any particular state. Moreover Congo and similar countries were too
                            primitive and backward to justify trying persuade them accept any
                            particular ideology. They <pb n="185" xml:id="pg_185" facs="0207"

                            countries, particularly US, but Yugoslavia could make modest
                            contribution also.</p>
                        <p>Asked if he could comment on recent visits to Yugoslavia of Sekou Toure
                            and Ayub Khan, <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> spoke highly
                            of former. He had been much impressed by Guinean’s grasp of world
                            problems and was certain he would maintain his country’s full
                            independence and right to follow its own course. He admitted some
                            differences of opinion with Pakistan but was gratified at extent of
                            agreement reached in drafting joint communique. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> had heard Indian and Afghan
                            positions and was glad to get that of Pakistan.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> then volunteered admission
                            that Yugoslavia had been more critical of US and West in general than of
                            Soviet bloc. He suggested the criticism of the West had slackened
                            recently and that further improvement might be expected. Yugoslav
                            differences with West were specific and practical, he said, while with
                            Soviet Union they were ideological. Further than that he said he would
                            not discuss reasons why Yugoslavia was more reticent in dealing with the
                            East.</p>
                        <p>Finally <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> told me that as
                            outcome of talk with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            in New York and subsequent exchanges, Foreign Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_PK1">Koca Popovic</persName> would visit Moscow in
                            spring and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would come to
                            Belgrade. He observed that press doubtless would try attach exaggerated
                            importance to this exchange. Actually, it was clearly understood that
                            ideological issues would not be discussed; only practical matters. But
                                <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> thought we should have
                            advance notice of this. He wished our governments could consult each
                            other more frequently in advance.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> appeared in excellent health
                            and as affable as I ever saw him. His decision on all points was most
                            reasonable. However I still have misgivings about this African trip,
                            since past experience suggests his statements and actions there likely
                            to be influenced by considerations other than concern for welfare of
                            Africans. We may hope Department’s message will have salutory
                            effect.</p>

                        <p>I made yesterday my routine farewell call on the President. The Secretary
                            of State came in while I was there and I remained, at the President’s
                            request, throughout the Secretary’s visit. Most of the talk concerned
                            Laos and other matters not directly connected with Yugoslavia. At one
                            point, however, we did talk briefly on Yugoslav matters.</p>
                        <p>The President asked me how I felt about the present situation and
                            policies of the Yugoslav Government. I told him that the attitude the
                            Yugoslavs were adopting did not seem to me to be entirely satisfactory
                            from our standpoint; that they were getting the bulk of their economic
                            and financial aid from us and yet they seemed to be supporting the
                            Soviet position on almost every important issue in world affairs
                            ulterior to their own bilateral relations with the Soviet Union; that
                            while I thought it not out of the question that this could be, to some
                            extent, corrected under the present leadership, and would of course have
                            this in mind when I went to Belgrade, I feared that <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> and his leading associates were too
                            deeply affected by their early Communist training to be able to get away
                            from it entirely: that they would always be sensitive to the charge that
                            they were becoming tools of the imperialists, and would always lean
                            somewhat to the Communist side in world affairs as a means of salving
                            their Communist consciences. For this reason, I thought it best for us
                            to direct our principal hopes to the second generation of Yugoslav
                            leaders, particularly the younger people in the echelon just under the
                            top. I thought for various reasons that these people might be more
                            amenable to an understanding of our point of view and less fearful of
                            appearing to have normal and intimate relations with us.</p>
                        <p>The President asked me what I thought about a visit of <persName

                            inviting <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>, but I wanted to
                            make sure that this was done under the most favorable circumstances, and
                            that it would produce some favorable effect of a tangible nature on

                                >Telegram 766, May 12, noted that the Yugoslav Press Law and its
                                “hard-line” negotiating position might necessitate a drastic
                                reduction in <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> operations with a

                                (Ibid., 768.11/5–1061)</note> and agree that it would be unfortunate
                            if in the wake of extension of such an invitation US-Yugoslav relations
                            were to suffer drastic setback as result of failure to find solution to
                            Press Law problem. Although I am still hopeful that at least an interim
                            solution can be found, Thursday’s meeting certainly brought US no closer
                            to agreement. On the other hand, it would be equally unfortunate if
                                <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> were to be left with
                            initial impression that change of administrations at home had brought no
                            change whatsoever in what he probably regarded, rightly or wrongly, as
                            inhospitable attitude in Washington with relation to his own person.
                            This might, in fact, even affect unfavorably the Yugoslav position in
                            the Press Law question.</p>
                        <pb n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0210"/>
                        <p>I propose, therefore, unless Department voices objection, to indicate to
                                <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>, on occasion of
                            presentation credentials, that I hope at early date to have opportunity
                            to discuss with him various questions of world affairs and of US-Yugo
                            relations, but this perhaps not best occasion, and that unfortunately I
                            have found myself much preoccupied since arrival by the problems imposed
                            by the Press Law, which are urgent in view of early deadline imposed by
                            entry into effect of law on June 9.</p>
                        <p>If <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> accepts this statement, I
                            would hope to delay further discussions along this line until Press Law
                            question has been clarified.</p>
                        <p>Should he himself, however, contrary to expectations, raise question of
                            visit or exchange of visits, then I think any show of hesitation or lack
                            of instruction on my part would be unfortunate and I should say at once
                            that this was subject President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                                >Kennedy</persName> had much on his mind; that I had discussed it
                            with him; that it was one of the matters I had hoped to discuss with him
                            on a more suitable occasion; that I could tell him the President
                            definitely hoped that such a visit by <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName> could be arranged but it was a question of
                            timing—the President’s present schedule would scarcely allow of such a
                            visit being fitted in during the current year.</p>
                        <p>In absence of instructions to the contrary, I shall be guided by above

                        <p>Gave briefing orally and in rough summary. <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName> seemed pleased and appreciative that I had done
                            this. He made no substantive comment other than that the Soviet position
                            on tripartite organization of United Nations Secretariat and control
                            organization for weapons testing inspection with veto provision was also
                            quite unacceptable to Yugoslavs. It appeared to assume, he indicated,
                            some sort of neutral bloc capable of acting as a body, and this did not
                            exist. His general reaction to what I told him of results of Vienna was
                            that meeting was useful first step and it was to be hoped that both
                            governments would now review their own positions carefully with view to
                            seeing whether mutual concessions could not be made. He felt that if
                            only one of the great problems could be solved this would itself be of
                            great usefulness in improving atmosphere for further agreements.</p>
                        <p>Before leaving I drew his attention to fact that final session of Press
                            Law talks was now in progress and that I had authorized Lisle, in event
                            of continued disagreement, to present note announcing closure of reading
                            rooms. He immediately said this must not happen, that there was no
                            reason why our reading rooms could not continue their activities in
                            manner wholly satisfactory to us. Yugoslav intent had not been to make
                            any serious difficulties. He was prepared to give me his personal
                            assurance that if agreement could be reached among our negotiators today
                            every liberality would be shown in treatment of reading rooms. I told
                            him that I had just received messages authorizing our negotiators to
                            make substantial concessions this morning,<note n="2" xml:id="d91fn2"

                            I hoped reciprocal concessions would be made on the Yugoslav side. He
                            said he would personally intervene at once in matter. Before leaving I
                            spoke of uneasiness evidenced by some of our local employees over their
                            personal position vis-à-vis Yugoslav authorities as they attempt to
                            carry out their functions as employees our government, and said I hoped
                            it would be <pb n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0212"/>possible to find
                            means of reassuring them that Yugoslav Government saw no conflict
                            between this work and their status as loyal Yugoslav citizens. I asked
                            that any doubts or questions Yugoslav Government might have as to
                            propriety of their actions be brought first to my attention and not to

                            wish to make or to discuss timing and nature of such a visit. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> said that while he would not try
                            to anticipate President’s reaction he knew he would be moved and
                            gratified by knowledge that President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                                >Kennedy</persName> wished him to come.</p>
                        <p>I said that for the present, and pending the President’s reply, we
                            thought it best to say nothing about this publicly, and he indicated
                            strong assent.</p>
                        <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0213"/>
                        <p>I took occasion to emphasize to <persName corresp="#p_PK1"
                                >Popovic</persName> that this invitation was extended gladly and in
                            all cordiality, that it was a matter to which careful thought had been
                            given at home, and that if President <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName> decided to come, I could assure him every effort
                            would be made to make visit a pleasant and profitable one. I had the
                            impression that <persName corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> was
                            himself greatly pleased.</p>

                        <p>I visited President <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> this
                            morning and talked with him for an hour and a quarter. It was the most
                            informal and relaxed of the talks I have had with him. The only others
                            in attendance were the Foreign Minister, <persName corresp="#p_PK1">Koca
                                Popovic</persName>, and the President’s personal secretary, Bogdan
                            Crnobrnja. The President began by speaking Russian, and we continued in
                            this language throughout the discussion.</p>
                        <p>An initial question by the President about my progress in the study of
                            the Serbo-Croatian language led us, by stages, to the subject of his
                            recent speech at <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> vo Uzice.
                            The mention of this event brought us to the subject of the partisan
                            warfare he had conducted from 1941 to 1945. The President seemed to
                            enjoy the subject, and it detained us for some twenty minutes.</p>
                        <p>Turning to his present plans, he said that he expected to visit Brazil at
                            some time during the current year, but did not yet know exactly when <pb
                                n="192" xml:id="pg_192" facs="0214"/>it would be. He thought Brazil
                            was a very important country. He hoped we in the United States would be
                            able to adjust our own relationship to Brazil in a constructive and
                            satisfactory manner.</p>
                        <p>Talk turned on Brazil’s participation in the forthcoming Belgrade
                                conference.<note n="1" xml:id="d93fn1">The Belgrade Conference of
                                Non-Aligned States September 1–6.</note> I explained to him the
                            nature of <persName corresp="#p_CJ1">Cabot</persName>’s interview<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d93fn2">In a July 11 statement in response to a
                                reporter’s question about Brazilian participation in the Belgrade
                                Conference, Ambassador to Brazil <persName corresp="#p_CJ1">John M.
                                    Cabot</persName> stated that Brazil could not be an “uncommitted
                                nation.”</note> and told him that our Government had taken no
                            position pro or con on the subject of the participation of other nations
                            in the conference. He then inquired my personal opinion about the
                            participation of Latin American nations. I said that this suggestion
                            naturally raised some delicate questions. I personally thought that if
                            it were a case of several Latin American nations, the significance
                            attached to it would be less than if it were just one or two; but I
                            emphasized again that my Government had carefully refrained from giving
                            any advice to anyone, one way or another. He said that Yugoslavia would
                            be very unhappy if Cuba turned out to be the only Latin American country
                            to be represented.</p>
                        <p>He asked me how I felt about the conference, generally. I said that we
                            took a very calm view of it. We knew that there would be some extremist
                            voices there. On the other hand, we were confident that Yugoslavia would
                            use her influence in the direction of moderation, and we knew that she
                            would not be the only one. To this, President <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName> agreed; but he said the greater the number of the
                            moderate countries represented, the easier it would be for Yugoslavia.
                            He stressed, emphatically and at considerable length, that Yugoslavia
                            had no desire that the conference should in any way exacerbate
                            international relations: on the contrary, he deeply hoped that its role
                            would be to help the great powers find solutions to their problems. The
                            question had been raised, he said, as to whether they were not
                            preempting the role of the United Nations in holding such a conference.
                            He felt that this was not at all the case — that they were merely acting
                            to increase the usefulness of the voice which the unaligned nations
                            could have at the forthcoming United Nations session.</p>
                        <p>I then took the liberty of saying that I had now been here two and a half
                            months and had had some opportunity to acquaint myself with conditions
                            in Yugoslavia. The impression I had, after this experience, was one of
                            growing admiration for the country and the people and of a very strong
                            feeling that our two peoples ought, by all criteria of temperament and
                            character, to be the best of friends. On the other hand I had become
                            increasingly aware of the depths of some of the ideological <pb n="193"
                                xml:id="pg_193" facs="0215"/>differences, and the differences of
                            outlook on world problems, which divided us.</p>
                        <p>This led to the subject of world affairs. The President said that their
                            view on Germany was similar but not identical with that of the Russians.
                            They knew the Germans well. They had suffered from them. They did not
                            trust them. They continued to regret deeply the rearming of Western
                            Germany. They recognized that this had occurred within the framework of
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and was, therefore, not an
                            immediate danger. But they were skeptical about the future. Some day the
                            Germans would turn on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> with the
                            very arms <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> had given them. For this
                            reason, they firmly favored a divided Germany. They made no bones about
                            this. They did not want to see the country united. They did not want to
                            see the military resources of Eastern Germany added to those of Western
                            Germany. This meant that they had no choice but to support the Russian
                            bid for recognition of the East German regime. They were sorry if this
                            inconvenienced us; foreign policy was something one had to be consistent
                            about.</p>
                        <p>I told him that I thought it was a very serious mistake of the Russians
                            to try to portray the <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>
                            regime as a Hitlerite regime, and emphasized my reasons for feeling that
                            this was utterly misconceived. I mentioned the special feelings we have
                            about the people of West Berlin, told him of my own five years of
                            residence there and of how I had known them personally during the war as
                            the least Nazi of all the German people, reminded him of the way they
                            had stood by us during the Berlin blockade, and explained that we could
                            not let them down. He replied that this was all very well, but he did
                            not see, in this case, what prevented us from sitting down at a table
                            with the Russians and talking the matter over. I pointed out that an
                            atmosphere had arisen in which even the suggestion of negotiation with
                            the Russians about Berlin smacked to many people of compromise and
                            appeasement a la Munich. He said that the parallel was wholly
                            misconceived. He thought, in fact, that we had been very unwise to
                            heighten the atmosphere of military tension by talking about our
                            military plans. He could understand that we might wish to take military
                            measures, but he could see no reason why these measures should have been
                            publicly advertised. Things were bad enough as it was.</p>
                        <p>We then spoke about the colonial problem and Africa. Much of what he had
                            said, I had heard before. He spoke, this time, with great feeling. He
                            said we Americans were always too late. The process of the
                            disintegration of colonialism was marching with tremendous speed; no one
                            could stop it; if there was not a prompt and adequate response, this
                            could be very dangerous—dangerous for everyone, for us and even for
                            them, the Yugoslavs. There was even a danger that they, too, would be
                            too late. He asked us to bear this in mind when we judged Yugoslav
                            policies toward Africa. They were trying to avoid this mistake.</p>
                        <pb n="194" xml:id="pg_194" facs="0216"/>
                        <p>I said that I thought we were doing all we could. In reply he mentioned
                            Guinea. Here, he said (rather obliquely), was a place where we had a
                            real chance of building a constructive relationship. I said I thought we
                            had been giving aid to a number of African countries, including Ghana
                            and Guinea. At the mention of Ghana, he shrugged his shoulders,
                            indicating that was a special case. (I gathered that he thought Ghana
                            was largely out of control and beyond influencing.) But much could still
                            be done with Guinea.</p>
                        <p>He thought we had made a mistake in supporting our <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies so extensively on such
                            questions as Algeria, the Congo, and Angola. Since he seemed unaware
                            that we had opposed the Portuguese publicly on the question of Angola, I
                            took pains to point this out to him; but I am not sure how well it
                            registered.</p>
                        <p>I said that I felt that considerable injustice had been done to us by the
                            Yugoslavs in their view of what had occurred in the Congo. They seemed
                            to suspect us of having inspired Mr. <persName>Hammarskjold</persName>
                            to take positions in the Congo which were aimed at the preservation of
                            the positions of the Belgians in that country. I could not imagine how
                            they arrived at such a view; I was sure there was no substance to such
                            suspicions.</p>
                        <p>To this <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> replied that it was
                            true: they suspected Hammarskjold of acting in the interests of the
                            Belgians and felt he had in many ways exceeded his authority. They also
                            felt that our influence had played a part in bringing him to act in this
                            manner. In general, Hammarskjold had taken much too much upon himself.
                            He confessed that he could not warm to Hammarskjold personally—just
                            didn’t like him. They did not support <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s “troika” principle in its present form, but
                            they thought that a stricter control ought to be exercised over the
                            activities of the Secretary General. The latter ought not to act as an

                        <p>I ended the talk by saying that I thought we were entering on a very
                            serious and critical time, and they and we ought to be extremely
                            careful, in this coming period, to assure that, even if we could not see
                            things identically, at least misunderstandings were ruled out to the
                            maximum degree. In the differences we had, there was a strong element of
                            ideological preconception, which would not be straightened out in any
                            short time. But there were also, I thought, certain differences which
                            rested on real misunderstanding, and could be cleared away by the
                            recognition and acceptance of a common set of facts. I hoped, for this
                            reason, that they would not hesitate to give me an opportunity for

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> did not appear to me
                            to be as robust as I had seen him on previous occasions. His Chief of

                            recent illness. His appearance and manner seemed to me to bear out this

                            interview, were watching me very attentively throughout the interview in
                            an effort to discern what was my reaction to the President—to his manner
                            and his statements. I have the impression that these men, and others of
                            his close advisers, entertain feelings of deep affection and admiration
                            for him. Though they realize that his physical powers are not quite what
                            they were, they intensely hope that a person like myself will be
                            discerning enough to see in him the qualities they see and to share some
                            of their respect for him.</p>
                        <p>If they knew my real thoughts, they would not, I think, be disappointed.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> is a very human sort of a
                            figure. He is a tough old revolutionary, who has faced extraordinary
                            trials and has survived them all with remarkable success. In many
                            respects, he has the temperament of a born military-political leader,
                            with all the attendant faults and virtues. When he makes a decision, he
                            has the courage to stick to it. His judgments about people are rough and
                            ready—not always right, but usually not without shrewdness. Once he has
                            recognized someone as an enemy, he is ruthless and consistent in
                            combatting him, though not vindictive. By the same token, he will not
                            betray a friend; nor is he easily led to turn on anyone who has once
                            given him loyalty and support within the movement. He can be crafty,
                            where necessary, but he has none of Stalin’s refined hypocrisy and
                            cruelty.</p>
                        <p>He is, of course, still in part the victim of ideological misconceptions.
                            He himself admitted in our conversation that he had once been an
                            extremist himself: circumstances, he said, had required this, though
                            perhaps he, too, had not been as fast as he should have been in seeing
                            the <pb n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0218"/>writing on the wall and in
                            making the change. His Marxist prejudices still confuse him; and the
                            historical experience of his people renders him abnormally sensitive to
                            any suggestion of the oppression of a smaller people by a larger one.
                            But underneath all this, there lies an excellent, pragmatic political
                            mind, not deeply philosophical, but exceptionally sensible and
                            realistic. He has gained both stature and mellowness with the years.</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances, there is justification for the admiration and
                            affection in which he is held by his younger associates; and those in
                            the Western world who tend to regard him just another Gottwald or
                                <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName>, but one who happened
                            to break loose from Moscow, are making a big mistake.</p>

                                    situation, Yugoslavs earnestly plead that we, in interest of

                                    adequately proved we were neither weak nor timid, and were
                                    convinced we had everything to gain and nothing to lose by such

                                    and confidence rather than weakness. Though not denying depth of
                                    Ulbricht’s political failure, they pleaded for recognition of
                                    GDR, feeling that this lay at heart of difficulty with

                                    become dangerous and embarrassing to him, or was it his purpose
                                    to embarrass and weaken US. They replied unhesitatingly that
                                    everything in <persName corresp="#p_PK1">Koca
                                    Popovic</persName>’s Moscow conversations had indicated the

                                    recognized <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s
                                    impulsive nature and tendency to flamboyant, provocative
                                    statements, but considered that beneath it lay a cold and
                                    realistic political intelligence, and that he could be sober
                                    enough when it came to responsible negotiation.</item>

                                <item>They reiterated and stressed at length their strong feelings
                                    on colonial problem, emphasizing once again that this
                                    constituted their major difference with US. They thought we
                                    should have put greater pressure on the Portuguese and on French
                                    over their African problems. <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                        >Tito</persName> stated frankly that he had never been able
                                    to understand our attachment to <gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                                    interests. He felt this, more than anything else, stood in way
                                    of our adoption of full hopeful and constructive policies in
                                    Africa.</item>

                                <item>It was clear that they strongly suspected US of having opposed
                                    participation of uncommitted nations in Belgrade conference, and
                                    were deeply affected and hurt by this impression. Failure to
                                    date of any moderate invitees to agree to attend has been
                                    serious blow to them. We assured them US Government, to our
                                    knowledge, had been careful to take no position on this matter,
                                    pro or con, and had made no representations or suggestions to
                                    any government one way or another; but I am not sure we
                                    convinced them. <persName corresp="#p_PK1">Koca
                                        Popovic</persName> said pointedly that whereas European
                                    neutrals had been sounded out informally, none had indicated a
                                        <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0220"/>desire to attend.
                                    Yugos felt, it was inferred, that this could not have been the
                                    case had our attitude been other than unfavorable. The same
                                    applied, I gathered, in case of South American invitees.
                                    Nigeria, they told us, had now definitely declined to attend.
                                    They did not suspect US of having made direct representations to
                                    Nigerians, but they could only view Nigeria’s answer in light of
                                    Sir <persName>Abubakar</persName>’s presence in US at time it
                                    was given, and felt that position had clearly been taken in
                                    deference to American position.</item>

                        <p>In his reply to these various points, Under Secretary described recent
                            developments of our African policy, noted particularly lack of political
                            conditions on our aid as witnessed by their own experience and that of
                            African governments highly critical of our policies which had,
                            nevertheless, continued to receive our aid, and pointed out that to put
                            pressure publicly on French with regard to North Africa would be to
                            forfeit all real possibility of exercising moderating influence of them.
                            He also traced effect of Korean War on development of <gloss

                        <p>So much for discussion. Our impression is that Yugoslav positions at
                            forthcoming Belgrade meeting will be importantly influenced, rightly or
                            wrongly, by impressions they gain on following points: <list>

                        <p>They will be watching intently development of US policy in intervening
                            period.</p>
                        <p>If nothing develops to give them encouragement on any of these lines,
                            they will go into the conference with strongly negative and almost
                            bitter feelings toward US, and disinclined to expend their influence to
                            restrain the strongly anti-American tendencies which will certainly be
                            represented among other delegations. In our opinion, there is not much
                            more that can be done to alter this state of affairs by personal
                            argument and pursuasion.</p>
                        <p>Both Under Secretary and I are convinced this state of mind reflects no
                            personal anti-Americanism on part of present Yugoslav leaders, and no
                            complaint arising out of our bilateral decisions, but flows rather from
                            deep and honest disagreement about wisdom of certain our policies on
                            world arena. On other hand, we feel Yugoslavs have it in their power to
                            be distinctly helpful at Belgrade conference, and would in principle
                            like to do so. They are visibly impressed with Under Secretary’s
                            reminder <pb n="199" xml:id="pg_199" facs="0221"/>that if Berlin crisis
                            could be surmounted this might be starting point for new and much
                            hopeful era of world affairs. There can be no question of their present
                            unhappiness or of their desire to contribute to such development if they
                            can see their way clear to doing so.<note n="3" xml:id="d94fn3">In

                        <p>328. Yesterday I sent personal note to Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_PK1">Koca Popovic</persName> informing him of my return
                            to Belgrade and stating that while I was not requesting an appointment,
                            I was at his disposal in case there was any information he required
                            concerning views or policies of our government in light of forthcoming
                            conference. I added an expression of my confidence that we could rely on
                            maturity of Yugoslavian leaders to assure that so far as Yugoslavia was
                            concerned, questions to be discussed at conference would be treated with
                            the moderation and sense of responsibility which their gravity demanded.
                            He sent word later in the day that he wanted to see me and I called on
                            him this morning. He said he appreciated delicacy of my communication,
                            and thought it might be desirable that we have a talk at this point. I
                            subsequently learned that he had arranged to receive, just after myself,
                            the Foreign Ministers of all the participating conference delegations,
                            for discussion of the Soviet announcement on resumption of tests.<note
                                n="1" xml:id="d95fn1">For text of the August 30 Soviet announcement,
                                see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament, 1961</hi>, pp.
                                348–350.</note></p>
                        <p>I told him that I took a very grave view of present situation, in light
                            of Soviet measures in Berlin, their action in bringing up question of
                            air corridors, and finally their announcement of nuclear test
                            resumption. I pointed out we had made four major concessions this week
                            in test talks; that Russians had obviously been disingenuous in
                            stringing the discussions <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0222"/>along
                            in recent days; and that, if they suspected us of secretly conducting
                            tests, they had had every opportunity to raise this question at Geneva.
                            Said I was certain we would have welcomed impartial investigation. I
                            pointed out great restraint with which we had reacted to resist Soviet
                            measures in Berlin and heavy burden this had placed on our relations
                            with West Berliners, also that Russians had shown no evidence of any
                            desire to reciprocate this restraint and had seemingly done all in their
                            power to render difficult, rather than facilitate, the peaceful
                            composition of differences. I said that to my mind their conduct left
                            room only for the gloomiest hypothesis as to their true motives.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> made careful note of these
                            observations and replied, though without much show of conviction, that
                                <gloss target="#t_GOY1">GOY</gloss> still did not believe the Soviet
                            Government was deliberately steering toward war. He recognized it as out
                            of the question that we had been secretly testing nuclear weapons and
                            said this thesis would be given no credence in Belgrade. The Yugoslav
                            Government, he said, had been aware for some days that Soviets had been
                            preparing an announcement about tests. <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName> had expressed to Soviet Ambassador when he received
                            him yesterday morning at airport, misgivings with which Yugoslavs took
                            note of evidence of Soviet intentions in this regard. He, <persName
                                corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName>, had not yet had time to discuss
                            with other members of his government the effect of Soviet announcement.
                            In general, their position remained that, while there was a connection
                            between test ban talks and general disarmament, it was desirable that an
                            agreement on tests be reached independently and as early as possible.
                            They thought the weakest part of our position had been behavior of
                            French. I gathered Soviets had played this hand to very good effect in
                            their discussions with Yugoslavs, and that latter had found no very
                            convincing counterargument to Soviet representations on this point.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> then went on to say that
                            they considered the immediate recall of <persName>Dean</persName> a
                            mistake, and pleaded that we not respond to the Soviet announcement by
                            ourselves announcing immediate resumption of tests but await evidences
                            of actual Soviet testing before proceeding to this step. I told him our
                            long patience in Geneva negotiations had already aroused much uneasiness
                            in public opinion at home and said I thought it would be very difficult
                            for President now to resist pressures for immediate resumption of
                            testing, but would of course transmit his views.</p>
                        <p>I asked whether test ban question would be treated at forthcoming
                            Belgrade Conference. He said even before Soviet announcement it was
                            planned this question should be mentioned both in President <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s opening address and in the draft
                            declaration the Yugoslavs would put forward. What effect the last Soviet
                            announcement would have on this, he was unable to say; but I gathered it
                            certainly did not decrease likelihood that conference would address
                            itself to this question.</p>
                        <pb n="201" xml:id="pg_201" facs="0223"/>
                        <p>I asked him about Germany and Berlin. He said we knew their views. They
                            considered rearmament of Germany had been great mistake. They thought it
                            high time recognition was accorded to Oder–Neisse boundary, which could
                            certainly not be changed without war, and that existence of two
                            Germanies was accepted. I gathered he was warning me of those particular
                            elements in respective passage of <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName>’s forthcoming speech which will be disagreeable to
                            us.</p>
                        <p>He asked me how I felt about events in Brazil.<note n="2" xml:id="d95fn2"
                                >On August 25, President Janio Quadros of Brazil resigned after 7
                                months in office. The military members of his Cabinet unsuccessfully
                                attempted to block the return to Brazil of Vice President Joao
                                Goulart, his constitutionally-designated successor.</note> I said I
                            was completely confident we had had nothing to do with change of
                            government. He laughingly said this time even Yugoslavs were convinced
                            of this. I said I had no indication of views of my government on change
                            itself. As I understood it, we had not always approved all of Quadros’
                            actions and utterances, but we had never opposed his regime, and we had
                            gone ahead with extensive plans in way of aid to Brazil on assumption he
                            would continue to be in power. He said they did not regard this change
                            as a development likely to stabilize the situation; on contrary they
                            thought it beginning of long period of instability in Brazilian
                            affairs.</p>
                        <p>We spoke again of invitation to Latin American countries to attend
                            Belgrade Conference. I reiterated my conviction that we had brought no
                            pressure on anyone not to attend. Specifically, I had convinced myself
                            in Washington we had had nothing to do with Nigerian decision despite
                            fact it had been announced from Washington. He pointed out that decision
                            of Brazilians not to send observer had just now been communicated to
                            Yugoslavs through Brazilian Embassy in Washington though more direct
                            facilities were fully available. He said even if the Yugoslav Government
                            were prepared to believe we had nothing to do with this, people here
                            would be unlikely to show a similar credulity.</p>
                        <p>I inquired his views on Congo. He said situation there was still so
                            uncertain that Yugoslavs had been unwilling assume responsibility for
                            inviting new Congolese Government to Belgrade Conference and had placed
                            this question before preparatory committee, but no decision yet taken.
                            Asked whether Yugoslavs were not pleased by recent UN action in Katanga,

                        <p>So much for interview. Following is my own comment. While I realize we
                            will presumably be obliged to resume tests at very early date, I think
                            much would be gained if we could defer final announcement of such
                            decision until Belgrade Conference is over. This would not prevent us
                            from proceeding vigorously meanwhile with preparations for such testing
                            as we feel it necessary to conduct. It would, however, leave Soviets
                            holding bag for next few days and standing in their present position of
                            having not only flaunted <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s
                            expressed plea not to take this step at this time but having made

                        <p>I have repeatedly called attention to strong Yugoslav feelings over

                            my Western colleagues were prepared for so one-sided an attitude on

                            think we must reflect carefully on its implications for our treatment of
                            conference and, in more long-term, our attitude towards role of
                            Yugoslavs at this juncture.</p>
                        <p>I am stuck with <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s expressed
                            understanding that we are proposing to go to war over specific issue of
                            signing of peace treaty itself and his evident failure to understand
                            that our military interests could be actively engaged only if subsequent
                            effect of treaty were to create intolerable limitations on Allied rights
                            in Berlin or on freedom of city’s communications. I recently urged, in

                            an interpretation and implementation which would affect these factors
                            just mentioned. Would like now to repeat this recommendation. So long as
                            we let stand present ambiguity on this score we will lead with our chin
                            for line of reproach which <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>
                            took in this respect.</p>
                        <p>At conclusion <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s speech I had
                            occasion talk alone with Nehru during intermission. I expressed to him
                            my shock over image conveyed by <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName> of juxtaposition in Germany of stable East German
                            state peacefully developing under happy socialist system, as against
                            Western Germany seething with “Fascist and revanchist conceptions and
                            tendencies.” Pointed out this was fantastic distortion of facts, and
                            that no attempt by neutrals to play positive role in reaction to Berlin
                            crisis could conceivably be successful if it ignored fact that heart of
                            difficulty was incredible political failure of Ulbricht regime, which
                            could not even stand comparison with other Communist regimes of Eastern
                            Europe. This, I said, was problem not only for us but for Russians
                            themselves, and no action of this conference based on fiction this
                            problem did not exist could come anywhere near root of difficulty or
                            have any particularly helpful effect. Nehru listened attentively but was
                            non-committal. Private knowledge that same thesis was forcefully put to
                            him this morning by personal envoy of Willi Brandt leads me to hope all
                            this may have some effect on his thinking.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Archbishop Makarios</persName>’ speech,
                            which followed <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s, was very
                            constructive on Germany and nuclear testing, calling for reunification
                            Germany on basis plebiscite and characterizing Soviet test resumption

                        <p>It is unfortunately plain that if moderation and balance are to be

                        <p>Problem of our reaction to recent Yugoslav stance and behavior at
                            conference is highly complicated and affected by contradictory
                            considerations. There is evidence sudden distortion of Yugoslav policy
                            at conference in direction pro-Soviet positions did not have approval
                            all elements within <gloss target="#t_GOY1">GOY</gloss>. Suspect it was
                            even opposed by certain members Yugoslav delegation at conference, among
                            whom its main protagonist would probably have been Djerdja, possibly
                            also <persName corresp="#p_KE1">Kardelj</persName>. Others must have
                            argued such line would involve serious risk of affecting our attitude
                            toward Yugoslavia. If therefore we fail to react in any way we let down
                            not only ourselves but those here who have argued that such course would
                            not be in Yugoslav interests and would have unfavorable
                            consequences.</p>
                        <p>On other hand any abrupt or petulant reaction would be vulnerable to
                            distortion by regime and would be used to stir up feeling against US <pb
                                n="205" xml:id="pg_205" facs="0227"/>of otherwise strongly friendly
                            Yugoslav public. There is also danger, if reaction affects aid, that we
                            do things counter to basic purposes our aid programs, and ones that
                            would stand out as unjustified in light our practices elsewhere. We have
                            also to consider carefully effect of our reaction on other non-aligned
                            nations and other aid recipients.</p>
                        <p>General character of Yugoslav positions on world affairs, as revealed at
                            conference, was largely taken into account on recommendations made by

                                        but none should be concluded this fall and Yugoslavs should
                                        be given impression none are forthcoming. They should also
                                        be told this will involve drastic reduction <gloss

                                        arrangements should not be totally excluded, <gloss
                                            target="#t_TA1">TA</gloss> embraced number of negative
                                        elements, “such as rivalry, interference in internal
                                        affairs, the imposing of influence and the like,” and
                                        sometimes did more harm than good. He referred it should be

                                        financially or otherwise. Curtailment of <gloss

                                        Yugoslav leaders, especially <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                            >Tito</persName> himself, seem to have given scant
                                        attention to their own internal economic problems during
                                        current year as compared with their feverish preoccupation
                                        with development their relations with Africa. They have
                                        apparently relied on us to pick up check for deficits on
                                        agricultural front while immersing themselves in foreign
                                        policy ventures often strongly anti-Western and
                                        anti-American in spirit.</p>
                                    <p>Unjust and undesirable as this situation is, over long run,
                                        we must admit they had some reason for underlying assumption
                                        we would make up difference. They had no reason to suppose
                                        PL 480 aid would not continue to be forthcoming in adequate
                                        amounts. Were we to cut off shipments entirely with
                                        termination existing contract, there would be nothing they
                                        could do to improve their food supply by their own efforts
                                        earlier than next July. Result would be either heavy inroads
                                        on their foreign exchange reserves or genuine hardship to
                                        Yugo people. This being so, feel we should conclude one more
                                        contract to carry them over coming winter and most of
                                        spring, though not to point of meeting their demands in
                                        toto, but should couple expression of readiness to take this
                                        step with public statement that this represents, so far as
                                        our present intentions are concerned, terminal grant on
                                        present PL 480 terms, and that new basis will have to be
                                        found for further shipments of American surplus food. Exact
                                        amount such terminal grant can be determined by experts; I
                                        would suppose it would be in range of 3 to 400,000 tons.
                                        This would put them on notice at early date that they will
                                        be on their own next summer and that it is up to them to see
                                        to it their harvest is reasonably adequate. I actually think
                                        this necessity will prove to be in their own interests. It
                                        does not preclude a change of heart on our part next year if
                                        circumstances at that time seem to warrant it.</p></item>

                        <p>505. Mates asked me to call on him this morning and handed me
                            aide-memoire, abbreviated text of which follows in my next message.<note
                                n="1" xml:id="d98fn1">Telegram 506 from Belgrade, September 18.
                                (Ibid.) The aide-memoire was delivered in response to a U.S.
                                aide-memoire, provided to Mates on September 15, that outlined U.S.
                                concerns with Yugoslav actions at the Belgrade Conference. The
                                Department of State transmitted the outline of this aide-memoire to
                                the Embassy in telegram 323, September 13; see <ref target="#d96fn4"
                                    >footnote 4, Document 96</ref>.</note> His oral remarks accorded
                            closely with tenor of aide-memoire. They had been particularly stung, I
                            gather, by (1) our reference to their degree of unalignment as
                            representing a judgment they felt US not entitled to make, (2) our
                            reference to the role of Yugo at conference, and (3) what they felt was
                            a lack of balance in our interpretation of their foreign policy. Our
                            language, he indicated, had been offensive to them in some respects.
                            They had been mindful of our status as a world power as related to their
                            own size, and had not been able to escape impression that we had
                            endeavored to put pressure on them. They could, he said, have <pb
                                n="208" xml:id="pg_208" facs="0230"/>made an issue of the language
                            and held us to account for it, but they had decided against undertaking
                            any polemic over language itself, and had therefore decided to reply as
                            they did.</p>
                        <p>I said our government had had no intention of using offensive language or
                            of putting pressure on them, and if anything in the aide-memoire had
                            given them that impression, it was not intentional on our part. He said
                            they resented particularly our attempt to define what constituted their
                            unalignment and independence. Since “independence” was a word I had
                            taken liberty of excising from Department’s original draft, I pointed
                            out this had not appeared in aide-memoire. He said in their view
                            unalignment and independence were identical. I explained this was not
                            our view at all, that we had no suspicion Yugo policy was being dictated
                            by outsiders; but that we could easily picture an independent nation
                            ranging itself alongside one of the great powers in its foreign policy
                            positions to a point where it could lose plausible claim to
                            unalignment.</p>
                        <p>At close of our talk, I emphasized to him that while we concerned full
                            right of Yugo Government to determine its own positions, the positions
                            it had recently taken on some of great world issues differed very
                            seriously from our own, and this was a circumstance we could not fail to
                            take into account in connection with problems of Yugo-American
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>My impression is that formal exchange should be allowed to rest here. If
                            opportunities arise for informal talks with senior Yugo officials either
                            here, in Washington, or in New York, I think we should not hesitate to
                            repeat to them frankly and in detail our reasons for concern over

                                expressing it in aide-memoire was wrong and designed to bring
                                pressure on <gloss target="#t_GOY1">GOY</gloss>. Secretary replied
                                whole conference obviously designed bring pressure on us, that
                                Yugoslavs did not hesitate to criticize us when we did something
                                they did not like and should not mind when we did likewise and
                                furthermore Guantanamo was none of Yugoslavia’s business.” (Ibid.,
                                396.1–BE/9–2861)</note></p>
                        <p>It is naturally source of regret to me, but not one of surprise or
                            repentance, that some Yugoslavs should make out of adverse reaction they
                            have recently aroused in US a source of grievance against myself.
                            Actually, they are wrong in their suspicions. My briefing to US press
                            representatives here was not given until long after latter had filed
                            their stories on <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s speech;
                            and reactions I received on that occasion reflected much sharper
                            resentment of Yugoslav line than anything said in reply. If Yugoslav
                            leaders really believe adverse reaction due my personal influence, they
                            are simply nurturing illusions about temper US opinion in light present
                            crisis.</p>
                        <p>There are unquestionably embittered anti-Western elements within Yugoslav
                            set-up. Exactly where these lie is hard to determine. Assistant Foreign
                            Minister Djerdja, who was member Yugoslav delegation at recent
                            conference, and who appears now to be at <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName>’s side in latter’s Slovenian retreat, obviously
                            belongs to this category. It is significant that there has evidently
                            been, during recent months, a quiet retirement at Foreign Office, aimed
                            at elimination of pro-Western officials.</p>
                        <p>We are safe in assuming that anti-Western advisers have often argued with
                                <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> that he could safely take
                            anti-American positions without fear of jeopardizing Western economic
                            support. Past experience has seemed to confirm this view. Thesis has
                            frequently been heard here, after all, that Western nations cannot
                            afford not to give aid, and that ulterior political motives would house
                                [<hi rend="italic">force</hi>?] them to continue it even if economic
                            necessity did not. If now US reaction to recent Yugoslav conduct seems
                            to threaten validity this view, it is not surprising some people are
                            embarrassed and find it easier to blame things on an individual
                            foreigner than to admit to having made false estimate of limits of
                            Western patience.</p>

                        <p>Am persuaded that aside from <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s
                            speech, time has now arrived when thorough re-examination US-Yugoslav
                            relations could no longer have been avoided. Extent to which <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> has now gained full effective
                            independence vis-à-vis Moscow changes certain of basic assumptions on
                            which US policy toward Yugoslavia has heretofore been based. In addition
                            to that, what was tolerable in Yugoslav official utterances in quieter
                            times is no longer acceptable in a time of crisis, when the chips are
                            down. At some point, demand had to be raised for greater coherence
                            between Yugoslav political attitudes and reality of country’s economic
                            and cultural necessities. To be forced to realize this is highly
                            disagreeable to Yugoslavs, who are not used to taking political
                            consequences of their own words and to whom pleasure of eating cake and
                            having it too has become so familiar as to seem a god-given right. No US
                            Ambassador who had task of bringing this realization home to Yugoslavs
                            could or should expect to be universally popular here; and he would not
                            be doing his duty if he was. This is a burden I will cheerfully bear so
                            long as I am supported by Secretary’s and President’s confidence; for
                            readjustment in question is not only inevitable but is in interests of
                            both peoples. There are many people in Yugoslavia to whom this truth is
                            no less visible than to people at home. We can be sure that for every
                            bit of open opposition occasioned here by any effort to put relations on
                            basis more in accord with realities of time, there will also be many
                            friendly though muted Yugoslav cheers.</p>

                            generally and the basic considerations which we think should enter into
                            any reappraisal of our relations and any judgments we form about the
                            direction we should take, the objectives we should seek, and the tactics
                            we should employ. We have considered it unwise to move precipitately to
                            conclusions in this regard until we have had some opportunity of
                            observing <pb n="213" xml:id="pg_213" facs="0235"/>and taking due
                            account of reactions in all quarters. Consequently, our thinking in EUR
                            on the situation has been intentionally deliberate.</p>
                        <p>The impact of <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s speech and
                            Yugoslav positions at the Belgrade Conference upon American
                            sensibilities—as reflected by the adverse reactions within both official
                            and public quarters in the US—necessarily poses the question whether
                            existing US policy in its basic premises and concepts now requires
                            revision. We are strongly inclined to the view that it does not; and, in
                            any case, we feel again (a feeling that you also expressed in your

                        <p>Our policy toward Yugoslavia, in its basic aspects, is a policy
                            necessarily conceived in long-range terms. Briefly stated, our policy
                            is: <list>

                                <item>To assist Yugoslavia—a Communist-ruled state but one which has

                                    secure base of national independence and to support the
                                    determination that Yugoslavia has shown to preserve and
                                    strengthen its independent status.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>

                                    leadership for the evolution of Yugoslav political, economic,
                                    and social institutions along more democratically representative
                                    and humanistic lines with increasing ties to the West.</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>To follow a course which would bring the US maximum benefit
                                    from the significant role of Yugoslavia as an independent
                                    socialist state outside the Soviet bloc which exerts a
                                    disturbing influence upon the political and ideological unity of
                                    the Soviet-dominated international Communist movement and tends
                                    to stimulate the Soviet-dominated Eastern European governments
                                    to seek greater freedom of action from Moscow in shaping their
                                    own institutions and policies.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>This policy, in respect of these essential elements, was formulated in
                            the period following the <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName>–<persName>Stalin</persName> break of 1948 and has
                            been developed and applied with consistency and continuity over the past
                            decade. Admittedly, it has involved a calculated risk for the US both in
                            political and economic terms. It has been subject repeatedly to strong
                            attack from certain Congressional and public critics, particularly at
                            times like the present when the Yugoslav leadership has taken positions
                            on vital international issues that appear identical with or very close
                            to those of the Soviet Union. I think it has been to the credit of our
                            political leadership that it has had the foresight and courage to defend
                            our Yugoslav policy in the face of these attacks. As a result, the
                            policy has enjoyed the support of informed public opinion and has been
                            supported by the Congress in key legislative actions. Viewed objectively
                            and in perspective, <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214" facs="0236"/>and
                            notwithstanding the ups and downs of US-Yugoslav relations, the basic
                            elements of our Yugoslav policy have, in our judgment, achieved some
                            distinctly positive results. Yugoslavia’s course after 1948 and its
                            general, if very gradual, evolution since the break with Stalin has been
                            conclusively to the advantage of the US and to the Free World community
                            and to the discomfiture and disadvantage of the Sino-Soviet bloc.</p>
                        <p>We believe that in assessing the efficacy of our basic policy, it is
                            extremely important to give careful consideration to the long-term
                            receptivity to and the potentialities for constructive change that may
                            increasingly be found among the rising generation of Yugoslav leaders.
                            We cannot smugly predict a more definite shift to liberal and humanistic
                            socialism, but it would be a serious mistake to ignore or dismiss the
                            possibilities of such a development.</p>
                        <p>In the present Yugoslav situation we are, as we have said above, pursuing
                            a calculated risk in the basic aspects of our policy. It cannot be ruled
                            out that we may fail increasingly in that policy as time goes on. We see
                            no reason to believe that we are at that critical point of no return at
                            this stage. We are also trying, in taking a hard look at the basic
                            components of our policy, to look with equal realism upon possible
                            alternatives. We believe that any basic departure from our present
                            policy (and I am not referring here to some changes in attitudes and
                            tactics—of which I will speak later) would even at this stage of
                            Yugoslavia’s development as an independent state entail the risk of
                            moving Yugoslavia back toward and ultimately under Soviet
                            domination.</p>
                        <p>In this regard, we frankly do not go as far as you seem to go in your
                            estimate of Yugoslavia’s ability to maintain its national independence.
                            You would agree, I am sure, that the Yugoslav struggle against the
                            Soviet Union might have turned out far differently if it had not been
                            for our support both material and otherwise. But we believe that the
                            pressures and blandishments which the Soviets could bring to bear on
                            Yugoslavia in circumstances where US and other Western relations with
                            Yugoslavia began to assume a generally negative rather than a generally
                            positive character would be considerable. Moreover, as the confrontation
                            of Free World power and Soviet power extends throughout the world,
                            encompasses new fields of activity, and grows sharper, it may well be
                            that the non-aligned states, or those that aspire to such so-called
                            status, will find it increasingly difficult to avoid alignment on one
                            side or the other. Signs of the effect of these polarizing forces are
                            already evident. To the extent that these forces may operate, they are
                            relevant to the problem of Yugoslavia, even though we recognize, as you
                            have pointed out, that that problem is wholly unique and of great
                            complexity. In the long run, it is possible that the Yugoslavs may
                            succeed in going their own unique and unattached way, but there may well
                            be mounting pressure on them as time goes on to choose more definitely
                            between the divergent <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0237"/>and
                            alternative paths of democratic socialist freedom and national
                            independence within the community of free nations or of permanent
                            Communist dictatorship and eventual return to essential orthodoxy within
                            the Soviet-dominated international Communist movement.</p>
                        <p>I am fully aware, of course, that the thoughts I have expressed above are
                            in very broad and rather general terms. Yet, we feel that the basic
                            concepts which are, in fact, the foundation as well as the justification
                            of our policy are of utmost importance. If they are no longer valid and
                            if we are unable or unwilling to defend them against current and
                            possibly prolonged attack in this country, then our present course and
                            our investment of patient effort and considerable funds of the past
                            decade may come to an abortive conclusion, and there will be little
                            purpose in any serious consideration of more effective tactics for
                            dealing with the Yugoslavs. I have therefore concentrated on what I
                            think are the basic elements of our policy and on which I hope we can
                            clearly agree. You may be interested, in this connection, in the
                            enclosed <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> editorial which appeared
                            on September 29.<note n="5" xml:id="d102fn5">Not printed.</note> The
                            Times’ view is simply and categorically expressed and, though it talks
                            primarily in terms of the continuing validity of “US cooperation with
                            and economic aid to Yugoslavia”, it is clearly a forceful endorsement of
                            basic US policy toward Yugoslavia. Undoubtedly, it was evoked by an
                            awareness of the fact that that policy will now undergo searching
                            challenge in this country as a consequence of Yugoslav actions at the
                            Belgrade Conference. In this connection also, we were pleased to have
                            your telegram No. 592<note n="6" xml:id="d102fn6">Dated October 9.
                                (Department of State, Central Files, 411.6841/10–961)</note> which
                            distinguished quite clearly between abrupt and vindictive measures which
                            may prejudice irreparably our basic policy interests and objectives on
                            the one hand and sober examination of certain aspects of our relations
                            and of the tactics which we may wish to modify and hereafter employ on
                            the other hand.</p>
                        <p>If we are in agreement that we should continue our efforts to give effect
                            to a policy toward Yugoslavia which we regard as still valid in respect
                            of its basic elements, then we believe that our immediate problem—as
                            identified and viewed against the background of recent events at
                            Belgrade—is to complete our general stock-taking. We should determine,
                            taking full cognizance of the recommendations that you have submitted,
                            what our attitudes and tactics are to be in the various phases of our
                            dealings with the Yugoslavs, particularly with regard to the
                            continuation, <pb n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0238"/>modification, or

                        <p>These matters are presently under active consideration, as you doubtless
                            gathered from the Department’s telegram No. 429 of October 7.<note n="7"

                        <p>All of this indicates that we are undertaking a searching review of our
                            policy toward Yugoslavia. The immediate question leading to this review
                            has been whether to continue or change our arrangements for licensing
                            exports to Yugoslavia. The more limited consideration of trade has
                            broadened naturally into an examination of general policy and it has
                            been necessary to complete this review before we come to conclusions on
                            your three basic recommendations on economic aid to Yugoslavia.<note

                            >Tito</persName>’s four senior deputies. He does not frequently see
                            diplomats, and I had not previously met him. He received me in presence
                            of newly appointed head of American desk at the Foreign Office, Yaksa
                            Petric, and proceeded to say in substance the following.</p>
                        <p>The Yugoslav Government greatly regretted the recent deterioration in
                            Yugoslav-United States relations. It had not wished anything of this
                            sort, but could not avoid conclusion that it had taken place. In
                            substantiation of this view he pointed to: (1) The attitude and tone of
                            the American press, unfriendly to Yugoslavia in a degree not seen
                            before. They considered that Yugoslavia was being incorrectly portrayed.
                            People were being given a wrong opinion about it. (2) Hindrance to
                            economic cooperation. In recent years such collaboration had taken a
                            constructive course and had been mutually advantageous. It had recently
                                <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0240"/>been enriched by new forms
                            of cooperation in new spheres of activities. In addition to arrangements
                            between Governments there had been growing contacts between enterprises,
                            private companies, etc. However, recently the whole program of
                            cooperation was being blocked. Because of the atmosphere created by the
                            press, individuals and banks had been hesitant to proceed with these
                            arrangements. (3) Cancellation of Humphrey visit. The visit had been
                            agreed to, the program fixed and visits arranged with the President and
                            other leaders. Now all of this had been abruptly canceled. (4) An
                            article had appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Herald-Tribune</hi> (by
                            query I elicited this was from the pen of Rowland Evans) which accused
                            Yugoslavia of being anti-Western and dragged up episodes from the past.
                            The manner in which this article had appeared was offensive. (The hint,
                            I think, was that I had put Mr. <persName>Evans</persName> up to
                            this.)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_TM1">Todorovic</persName> went on to say that he
                            could continue this list of evidences of deteriorating relations but
                            thought it unnecessary. They had carefully considered my oral
                            representations to Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_PK1"
                                >Popovic</persName> (see <gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss>
                            486) and also our aide-memoire<note n="2" xml:id="d104fn2">The
                                aide-memoire was given to <persName corresp="#p_NM1"
                                    >Nikezic</persName> by <persName corresp="#p_KFD1"
                                    >Kohler</persName> on August 29. Telegram 254 to Belgrade,
                                September 1, informed the Embassy. (Ibid., 762.00/9–161)</note> and
                            had analyzed recent developments in our relations. They had come to
                            conclusion there had been change in US policy toward Yugoslavia and
                            wanted to know what it meant. Yugoslav policy toward US had not changed.
                            It remained that of an unaligned country. Why was the US interested in a
                            change of policy? The Yugoslavs felt entitled to an early answer. After
                            all, the program of mutual economic cooperation was blocked on a wide
                            scale. It was an important factor in their own plans. They were now
                            working on their economic plan for the coming period. This was soon to
                            be presented to Parliament. They needed to know where they stood. If the
                            US Government did not want to continue collaboration they would have to
                            look elsewhere, also they would have to inform their public which they
                            had thus far refrained from doing. They considered on basis of
                            experience of recent years that this collaboration was on an equal
                            basis, was mutually advantageous, fruitful and useful, not only
                            economically but politically, and that it had strengthened the forces of
                            peace. It was, they thought, a good thing and ought to be continued. If
                            it was not continued Yugoslavia would have economic difficulties but she
                            had known such difficulties in the past and would not shrink at facing
                            them. She had, however, herself done nothing to damage relations. To
                            restore their harmony would be contributing to peace. What the Yugoslavs
                            could not do was to change their foreign policy. They had a debt of
                            consistency to themselves. He asked me to inform my Government and the
                            President of what he had said.</p>
                        <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219" facs="0241"/>
                        <p>I replied that since my presentation of the aide-memoire to Mates on
                            September 15 (<gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss> 498), I had
                            received no further indication of the policies of my Government either
                            on the political side or with respect to economic collaboration. I
                            understood the importance of these matters to them and undertook to
                            transmit his statement to my Government and President at once and to
                            urge an early reply. I emphasized that we had no information here of any
                            restrictive measures taken with regard to economic collaboration except
                            that earlier this week we had heard something of a tightening of
                            controls on export licensing, but did not have full information. With
                            regard to Senator <persName>Humphrey</persName> I pointed out that it
                            had been our understanding that if he came to Yugoslavia he would not be
                            received by President <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> or any
                            other senior official. In these circumstances I had been unable to
                            encourage the Senator to believe that a visit here at this time would be
                            pleasant or profitable for him. I particularly regretted the
                            cancellation of his visit. I knew the Senator as a man of outstanding
                            intelligence and knowledge of international affairs, and as one who had
                            been favorably disposed in the past toward our collaboration with
                            Yugoslavia. I thought it a shame he had not been able to come here and
                            said if the Yugoslav Government had second thoughts I would be glad to
                            try to see whether the misunderstanding could not be cleared up and the
                            visit arranged after all. To this he made no comment.</p>
                        <p>On <hi rend="italic">Herald-Tribune</hi> article I said I had not seen
                            the article and was unable to comment on its content. I pointed out that
                            Mr. <persName>Evans</persName> and his two companions had also not
                            succeeded in making appointments with any of the senior Yugoslav
                            officials while here. To this he said they had descended on Yugoslavia
                            too suddenly and appointments could not be arranged in so short a
                            time.</p>
                        <p>I then said that while I could not respond to his statements at this time
                            on behalf of my Government I would like to make some private
                            observations. Anticipating his observations, I had already prepared
                            handwritten notes, from which I talked. These I left with him at the end
                            of our talk as a reminder. They are transmitted in the following message
                                (<gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss> 615).<note n="3"

                            embroidered on them somewhat. In conclusion I emphasized that if we
                            reacted as sensitively as we did to Yugoslav attitudes on world affairs
                            it was because our understanding for the unusual position of this
                            country and our regard for experience and personal qualities of
                            President <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> made it impossible
                            for us to take these differences casually.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_TM1">Todorovic</persName> ended the interview by
                            saying that my remarks had confirmed him in the belief that US policy
                            had changed. He wanted to stress <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0242"
                            />that it was with us, not with them, that the change had occurred.
                            Their policy was still one of positive unalignment based on their own
                            free judgment and independence, and was aimed at good relations with the
                            United States in the interests of world peace.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Todorovic</persName> had to seek
                            clarification US policy. US economic cooperation highly important to
                            Yugoslavia. Plans for coming period now being drawn up and Government
                            must know where it stands. Impression that US changing policy reinforced
                            when Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KGF1">Kennan</persName> told
                                <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Todorovic</persName> that economic
                            arrangements prevailing between Yugoslavia and US already ripe for

                            changes in these arrangements even without present troubled period.
                            Asked what likely to be practical effect of present situation re
                            Yugoslav requests (PL 480, <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> and Exim

                            stories re US attitude on PL 480 shipments unfounded. Yugoslavia’s
                            recent request not yet having been reviewed. We were now undertaking
                            consideration of this request within US Government. US review aid
                            programs always comes up about this time as we weigh resources available
                                <pb n="222" xml:id="pg_222" facs="0244"/>against requests from
                            different countries. Yugoslavs must realize that US faced with many new
                            demands for aid, particularly from countries far less developed than
                            Yugoslavia. It not possible now give any indications final US aid
                            program outcome. After all factors weighed and decision made reply would

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName corresp="#p_KFD1"
                                    >Foy</persName></hi>: On my return to my desk here Wednesday, I
                                found your letter of October 12, commenting on various of my
                                communications on US-Yugoslav relations. I am most grateful to you
                                for taking the trouble to give me this comprehensive statement of
                                the Department’s thinking on these matters. With much of it I can go
                                along; but there are some points with which I cannot fully concur,
                                and others which give me some concern. Let me tell you frankly what
                                I have in mind.</p>
                            <p>Your discussion opens by stating that “the impact of <persName
                                    corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s speech and Yugoslav positions
                                at the Belgrade Conference upon American sensibilities” poses the
                                question whether our policy towards Yugoslavia requires revision.
                                This suggests to me a certain misunderstanding of my position. I
                                have at no time taken the position that it was only, or even
                                primarily, the Yugoslav performance at the Belgrade Conference which
                                posed the question of a reconsideration of our policy towards this
                                country. You will recall that the paper submitted with my letter to
                                you of July 31,<note n="4" xml:id="d106fn4">Not found.</note>
                                actually drafted in June, gave a summary of Yugoslav positions on
                                international questions which accorded very closely with the views
                                    <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> later put forward at
                                the Conference. In my despatch 41, of July 20,<note n="5"
                                    xml:id="d106fn5">See <ref target="#d97fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                        97</ref>.</note> I submitted recommendations on aid which
                                implied changes in the concept of our basic policy. If, in the wake
                                of the Belgrade Conference, I tightened up the recommendations on
                                aid, it was because I felt that Yugoslavia’s performance at the
                                Conference represented a final demonstration <pb n="224"
                                    xml:id="pg_224" facs="0246"/>of the failure of my own efforts
                                and those of others in the new Administration to make an impression
                                on Yugoslav thinking, and a serious renewed commitment by the
                                Yugoslavs to the use of their international influence for purposes
                                not conducive to world peace and stability. This made it impossible
                                for us to hope for any early change in the Yugoslav position, forced
                                us to regard the Yugoslavs as being for the moment beyond our power
                                to influence with the means available to us, and left us no choice
                                but to take most serious account of their present stance in world
                                affairs.</p>
                            <p>The question, therefore, as I see it, is not whether <persName
                                    corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s performance at the Conference
                                justifies a change in our policy. The question is whether policies
                                which may well have been generally effective in the more distant
                                past retain their justification today, in light of the present
                                international situation and of Yugoslavia’s present stage of
                                economic development, and in the face of a renewed and highly
                                formalized commitment by <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>
                                to an anti-American policy scarcely distinguishable from that of the
                                Russians.</p>
                            <p>You list three purposes to which you conceive our present policy to
                                be addressed. Let me just comment on each of them: <list>

                                    <item><p>The first is: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                                  one which has successfully broken away from Soviet
                                                  domination—to build a firm secure base of national
                                                  independence and to support the determination that
                                                  Yugoslavia has shown to preserve and strengthen
                                                  its independent status.”</p>
                                            </quote></p>
                                        <p>The Yugoslavs, in my opinion, have already built a firm
                                            and secure base of independence, and need neither
                                            foreign inspiration nor foreign support in their
                                            determination to maintain it. Forgive me if I expand on
                                            this point, for it is a very important one.</p>
                                        <p>Two things are often confused here: (a) identity of
                                            policy with Soviet bloc, and (b) acceptance of a
                                            position of virtual or formal subordination to Moscow.
                                            In the first of these we have nothing to lose; in the
                                            second, we have nothing to fear.</p>
                                        <p>Yugoslav attitudes on international affairs are already
                                            either identical, or very nearly identical, with those
                                            of Moscow on all major world questions. The Yugoslav
                                            leaders have themselves repeatedly asserted this. There
                                            can be no question but that Yugoslav policy, like that
                                            of Moscow, is aimed generally at the frustration of
                                            United States efforts in the cold war and the
                                            elimination of our country as a major factor in world
                                            affairs. This policy is not the result of any lack of
                                            independence; it represents a deliberate choice on
                                                <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s part.
                                            He could, if he wished, take quite a different line.</p>
                                        <p>What <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> disagrees
                                            with Moscow about is only whether he should again
                                            accept, as before 1948, a relationship of direct
                                            subordination—formally <pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225"
                                                facs="0247"/>to the collective body of
                                            Moscow-approved communist parties, actually to the
                                            leaders of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In
                                            relation to international affairs, this question has
                                            secondary significance; it is only a matter of whether
                                            certain views are to be entertained, and certain
                                            policies followed, voluntarily or by way of formal
                                            obedience to external authority. The views and policies
                                            would be substantially the same in either case. With
                                            respect to domestic policies, however, the significance
                                            of this question is immense and painful. To accept
                                            Moscow’s authority once more would mean not only the
                                            sacrifice of all those features in which the Yugoslav
                                            social and economic system now differs from that of the
                                            Soviet Union (a sacrifice which the Yugoslav people
                                            could not be brought to accept today other than by the
                                            application of the most extreme Stalinist terror) but
                                            also granting Moscow in effect the right to determine,
                                            and to change at will, the political leadership of the
                                            Yugoslav party. I can assure you that rather than make
                                            these concessions, <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                                >Tito</persName> would go back into the hills and
                                            resume the life he led in the midst of the German
                                            occupation. I can conceive of no circumstances in which
                                            it would be worth his while to make such a journey to
                                            Canossa. To do so would negate all that he has striven
                                            for, and all that he has achieved, in thirteen years of
                                            independent existence. It would involve a personal
                                            humiliation so drastic as to wipe out completely the
                                            formidable image he has attained in the eyes of his own
                                            people and the underdeveloped world and to make it
                                            plainly impossible for him to carry on in the leadership
                                            of the Yugoslav party. Nor would it even be a hopeful
                                            solution to Yugoslavia’s economic problems. Even if our
                                            aid were to be wholly terminated (which, as you know, I
                                            have never advocated) the result, in my opinion and in
                                            that of the senior economic officials in our
                                            establishment here, would be merely a slowing down of
                                            Yugoslavia’s rate of growth, not a collapse of her
                                            economic system. A renewed submission to Moscow might
                                            bring some relief, but it would scarcely enable the
                                            Yugoslavs to avoid a falling off in the rate of growth.
                                            I cannot conceive of the Russians, if they again had
                                            control of Yugoslavia, permitting it to have a rate of
                                            growth higher than that of other Eastern European
                                            satellites.</p>
                                        <p>For these reasons, I have to give it as my considered
                                            opinion, after a half-year at this post, that
                                            Yugoslavia’s independence does not today depend on our
                                            aid. Our aid does, no doubt, facilitate to some extent
                                            the maintenance of this independence. This being so,
                                            there is a measure of justification for continuance of
                                            certain forms of aid; and this has been taken into
                                            account in the recommendations from this Mission. But we
                                            are overrating ourselves, and underrating both <persName

                                            his will to survival, if we think that his unwillingness
                                            to submit once more to Moscow’s authority is kept alive
                                            only by our largesse.</p></item>

                                        <p>This is certainly a worthy aim, but I have strong doubts
                                            as to how far our aid programs promote it today. The
                                            Yugoslavs are now engaged in drawing up a new
                                            constitution which will presumably determine the
                                            organization of their society—politically, economically,
                                            and socially—for a long time to come. They are also
                                            drawing up specific economic plans for the coming years.
                                            I know of no evidence that they, in undertaking this
                                            effort of forward planning, are appreciably influenced
                                            by our aid programs as such. They have come—and this
                                            cannot be too often emphasized—to take these programs
                                            largely for granted. They believe that we are giving
                                            this aid out of internal compulsions of our own, and
                                            that we will continue to give it regardless of their
                                            behavior either domestically or in foreign affairs. They
                                            therefore feel under no obligation to take our aid
                                            programs into account when it comes to shaping the
                                            character of their society. <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                                >Tito</persName> has said publicly, only this last
                                            Thursday (October 26), that there are no differences of
                                            opinion between himself and Moscow “on the ultimate aims
                                            of the building of socialism.” That has always been, and
                                            remains, his view. Nothing is further from his thoughts
                                            than to alter this attitude by way of reaction to our
                                            aid programs.</p>
                                        <p>It must be understood that the Yugoslavs receive aid from
                                            us unhappily. To them, it is a humiliation to take help
                                            from a capitalist country. They accept this humiliation
                                            as the price of economic necessity. But they feel toward
                                            us all the resentment and humiliation one normally feels
                                            toward someone whom one does not really regard as a
                                            friend but on whose financial charity one is momentarily
                                            dependent. They do not have confidence in the soundness
                                            of the structure of our society. They consider us doomed
                                            to ultimate failure in our undertakings on the world
                                            scene. Our readiness to aid them, in the given
                                            circumstances, is something which they regard, for the
                                            most part, with a cynical and ironic humor.</p>
                                        <p>In certain ways, of course, the Yugoslavs are influenced
                                            by our example in the shaping of their own society.
                                            There are certain respects in which they feel that
                                            methods and approaches adopted in the United States are
                                            separable from the social and political system
                                            prevailing there and can therefore be appropriated to
                                            Yugoslavia without danger. But in this area it is their
                                            own observations by which they are influenced, not our
                                            aid per se. I consider that our <gloss target="#t_DLF1"
                                                >DLF</gloss> operations are helpful in enabling them
                                            to make such observations; and I have, as you know,
                                            recommended that these operations should continue. I
                                            cannot say the same thing of the PL 480 aid, nor of the
                                            various programs implemented <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227"
                                                facs="0249"/>through private agencies. As for the
                                            technical assistance: this is a debatable point. I
                                            cannot bring myself to believe that the trend of
                                            Yugoslav society would be much different today had we
                                            never conducted programs of this sort.</p>
                                        <p>All in all, then, I would have to say that our aid is not
                                            an important factor in influencing the shaping of the
                                            development of Yugoslav society. Whatever value it might
                                            have along these lines would certainly not be materially
                                            reduced if the modifications in our programs proposed by
                                            this Mission were accepted.</p></item>

                                        <p>To this passage one would have to repeat, in the first
                                            instance, the comment made concerning (1) above: namely,
                                            that Yugoslavia’s independent role is today not
                                            primarily a product of our aid. We do indeed benefit
                                            from this independent role in the sense that it stands
                                            as a living proof of the possibility of a socialist
                                            country’s pursuing aims identical with those of Moscow,
                                            yet from a platform outside the scope of Moscow’s
                                            disciplinary authority. It is good to have this
                                            possibility documented currently. This constitutes a
                                            constant source of doubt and uneasiness within the
                                            communist camp. This benefit, however, is one which
                                            flows automatically from the fact of Yugoslavia’s
                                            independence. It represents an effect which the
                                            Yugoslavs cannot help producing, so long as they persist
                                            in defying Moscow’s authority. In so far as their
                                            independence gives them discretion in determining the
                                            effects of their actions on the bloc, it is plain that
                                            they make every conceivable effort to avoid causing
                                            trouble to Moscow. They seem concerned, in fact, to
                                            demonstrate at every point that there is therefore no
                                            reason for Moscow to take umbrage or to try to reassert
                                            its previous authority over Yugoslavia. It is to this
                                            end, I think, that <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                                >Tito</persName> takes such great care never to
                                            criticize the Russians publicly but to identify himself,
                                            wherever possible, with their positions on world
                                            affairs. In this sense, it may be said that we are
                                            deriving not maximum benefit from Yugoslavia’s role as
                                            an independent state but minimum benefit. It is the
                                            considered desire of Yugoslav leaders that this should
                                            be so.</p></item>

                            <p>So far, then, as concerns the purposes of our policy, I feel that
                                these purposes are being served only in limited degree by the
                                approaches and devices we have heretofore employed. The reason for
                                this is simply that times have changed and conditions have changed;
                                responses which <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0250"/>were
                                effective and justified in an earlier period have lost much of their
                                effectiveness and justification today; Yugoslav capabilities and
                                necessities have changed; and, as is so often the case in life,
                                stimuli which produced a certain effect when novel and unaccustomed,
                                no longer produce this effect when they have become routine and
                                expected.</p>
                            <p>In addition to this failure to serve positive aspirations, there are
                                certain ways in which our present practices have directly
                                deleterious effects. The regularity and inelasticity of our aid
                                programs—the extent to which they have become matters of habit and
                                routine rather than responses to conditions of the moment—and the
                                unwillingness on our part to recognize any connection between them
                                and the current political attitudes and behavior of the Yugoslav
                                Government—all these things have contributed, in my opinion, to
                                reactions on the part of the Yugoslavs which I find detrimental to
                                the wider purposes of our relations. It is these conditions which
                                cause the Yugoslavs to take our aid so extensively for granted, and
                                to believe that we are incapable, for domestic political reasons, of
                                not giving it. In addition to this, aid given in this manner—with so
                                little relation to the behavior of the recipient government—amounts
                                simply to a blanket underwriting of all the economic and financial
                                policies of this government and indeed even of such of its political
                                policies or actions which (like the recent Belgrade Conference) cost
                                a good deal of money and represent luxuries for a country of these
                                resources.</p>
                            <p>To some extent, in both the external and the internal fields, the
                                policies which we underwrite are ones directly contrary to our own
                                purposes. An example of this is in the agricultural field, where
                                surplus American food, if given too generously, simply relieves the
                                Yugoslav Government of the need of worrying about the productivity
                                of Yugoslav agriculture and enables it to afford the luxury of
                                ideological experiments, aimed against the individual peasant, which
                                are economically counter-productive. Similarly, in the field of
                                external relations, I feel that one of the effects of the extensive
                                aid we have recently given to the Yugoslavs has been to relieve them
                                of the necessity for coming to grips with the problem of their
                                economic relations with Western Europe, and to permit them to
                                indulge in all sorts of activities in Africa which no doubt
                                contribute to <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s personal
                                prestige but which are certainly not going to be the answers to
                                Yugoslavia’s long-term problems of international trade and finance.
                                One should also bear in mind, in this connection, the extent to
                                which the Yugoslavs have involved themselves in extending to African
                                countries very much the same sort of credits and technical
                                assistance which they have been getting from us. These favors, let
                                us recall, are being exploited politically not for purposes which
                                contribute in any way to those of our own foreign policy but rather
                                to ones which are almost identical with the Soviet Union. It seems
                                to me that we are taking <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0251"/>a
                                heavy responsibility, in the face of American opinion, by investing
                                American resources in such a manner as to underwrite uncritically
                                any and all policies, internal and external, which the Yugoslav
                                Government wishes to pursue.</p>
                            <p>In recent years, as you know, Yugoslavia has been the leading per
                                capita recipient of United States surplus food. In addition to this,
                                she stood, as I understand it, third last year on the list of
                                recipients of United States aid generally, being exceeded only by
                                South Korea and India. Now there is room, in my opinion, for a
                                moderate and highly discriminate measure of American economic
                                assistance to this country; and you will note that my
                                recommendations have allowed for this fact. But I think it
                                unrealistic to suppose that U.S. public opinion will long be willing
                                to adjust itself to a situation in which a country whose policies on
                                the international scene operate almost 95 per cent to the favor of
                                the Soviet Union figures among the leading recipients of U.S. aid.
                                These things are of course a matter of degree; but when was degree
                                not important? It is true that we should not demand of the
                                recipients of our aid that they agree with us on all international
                                questions. But we may demand of them a reasonable degree of
                                objectivity at least in the treatment of our differences with the
                                Soviet Union; and we may demand from them the evidence that they
                                feel some concern for the preservation of our power and influence as
                                a factor in world affairs. These things we do not receive from the
                                Yugoslavs. In my opinion, it is dangerous to suppose that our
                                economic collaboration with Yugoslavia can continue for very long,
                                in its previous dimensions, without arousing violent and possibly
                                unmanageable adverse reactions in the United States. To try to
                                continue them in this way is therefore to assume the risk that when
                                the scales are finally tipped, they will be tipped too violently,
                                and even that modest measure of economic collaboration between the
                                two countries which is warranted by circumstances will be
                                jeopardized. The best way to assure an even and fruitful development
                                in our relations with this country is to take account betimes of the
                                basic unfriendliness and lack of objectivity in its treatment of
                                ourselves and our world interests, and to scale our favors down to a
                                level which can be more easily defended in the face of domestic
                                opinion. The fact that the Department has thus far been successful
                                in resisting attacks on our aid programs for Yugoslavia is not a
                                guarantee that this will always be so; nor is it in itself an
                                argument why these programs should be maintained without change.</p>
                            <p>One last point. On September 15 I was sent down to the Yugoslav
                                Foreign Office to deliver a very stiff aide-memoire. I stated on
                                that occasion that the U.S. Government was compelled to take a
                                serious view of recent Yugoslav actions and it would necessarily
                                have to give continuing study to their implications for
                                U.S.-Yugoslav relations. Such a statement would obviously never have
                                been made to the Yugoslavs if we had <pb n="230" xml:id="pg_230"
                                    facs="0252"/>not intended to follow it up with some action, and
                                it ever occurred to me that this would not be the case. Had I
                                supposed that this was merely a matter of words and that we proposed
                                to do nothing further to make our displeasure felt to the Yugoslavs,
                                I should have remonstrated most vigorously against making any such
                                representations; for their only effect could then be to demonstrate
                                to the Yugoslavs the emptiness of our statements and to confirm them
                                in the view that they have nothing to lose by opposing us on the
                                world arena.</p>
                            <p>This is why I was startled to see it stated in your letter that the
                                Department is “strongly inclined to the view” that no revision of
                                existing U.S. policy “in its basic premises and concepts” is now
                                required. I can only take this to mean that the Department
                                disapproves of any modification of any sort in the aid program which
                                we have been carrying out in recent years, and which are now rapidly
                                coming to assume a routine and institutional character. I am sure
                                you will understand that if this is to be the response to the
                                recommendations that have gone forward from this Mission
                                (recommendations of whose general tenor the Yugoslavs are, I am
                                sure, aware) the weight of any words I may personally have occasion
                                to address to them in future on questions of world affairs will be
                                precisely nil.</p>
                            <p>My own views as to the line we should take toward the Yugoslavs today
                                are set forth in my various telegrams on aid and in my proposals for
                                the reply to <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Todorovic</persName>. I
                                think we must recognize that our aid programs have come to be taken
                                so extensively for granted by the Yugoslavs that their psychological
                                and political effect is minimal. We must recognize that it is not
                                realistic to hope that a country whose government is deeply
                                committed to the support of Soviet foreign policy can long continue
                                to be a leading recipient of American aid without this provoking
                                strong negative reactions in American opinion. I think that by
                                failing to modify these programs at present we will be increasing
                                the risk that some day our economic collaboration with this country
                                will be entirely and abruptly destroyed by violent reactions in
                                American public opinion. I feel, finally, that we will be making an
                                egregious tactical error, and will lose such slender possibilities
                                as we still have for influence over this Government if, having now
                                talked widely and strongly, we fail to give any substance to our
                                words in the form of action. For these reasons, I hope the
                                Department will give renewed and serious consideration to the
                                recommendations that have been made from this Mission, and will let
                                us have an early indication of our Government’s attitude on the
                                matters in question.</p>

                            policy is such that out of hand rejection, without consultation, would,
                            if based on President’s authority, seem to raise serious question of
                            confidence. Besides, in view present temper public opinion should think
                            it obviously disadvantageous that Congress be faced with <gloss

                                policy line. He rejected aid on such terms and insisted that

                        <p>Department will wish to make its own study this language, but it seems to

                                    we had previously done so.</item>

                                <item>Yugoslavia has in recent years not received from us any grant
                                    aid, nor is it asking for any. (This last is flatly stated and
                                    goes beyond limits of inference.)</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>I have no information as to what action our Government is considering
                            taking on 1962 Aid Programs, but understand decisions of some sort may
                            be expected in near future. Wish to point out that if above inferences
                            are allowed to stand uncorrected, any decisions we may make known along
                            these lines can only lead to further misunderstandings among Yugoslav
                            public. If, for example, in face of these statements, we now go ahead
                            and simply express readiness to conclude contract for further surplus
                            wheat, we create erroneous impression that, shamed by <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s logic and sobered by threatening
                            reference to bitterness of Yugoslav people, we have yielded to pressure
                            and agreed to do what were unwilling to do before he spoke. Same applies
                            to <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss>. If, similarly, we offer to renew
                            contracts for grant aid, it will look as though we are proffering a type
                            of aid Yugoslavs have not recently been receiving, do not want, and did
                            not ask for. In these circumstances, to ignore <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s statements and to act on aid
                            requests as though nothing had been said would be to compound a
                            confusion not our own making. It would also bring discouragement to
                            those people within the regime who have been trying to warn against
                                <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s anti-Western
                            course.</p>
                        <p>For these reasons, I feel we must react in some way. Several courses are
                            open to us. It is difficult for me to recommend any course in absence
                            information our intentions with respect to 1962 Aid Programs. Before we
                            do anything at all, we should make up our minds about PL 480 Aid.
                            Assuming that we are inclined, other things being equal, to make further
                            contract for delivery PL 480 wheat, would suggest course of action along
                            following lines: <list>

                                    in addition, to sell Yugoslavia any amount of wheat she required

                            setting forth the political implications of such termination of aid to

                                >Tyler</persName>’s review of U.S. policy and assistance programs to
                            Yugoslavia. Annex B includes EUR’s recommendation that, in addition to
                            P.L. 480 assistance, the U.S. should provide development grant
                            assistance in the amount of $2.8 million for FY 62 and development loans
                            in the magnitude of $15 million or $20 million. At Annex C is a
                            memorandum to Mr. <persName>Hamilton</persName> from his staff along
                            similar lines except that it recommends development loan funds be
                            limited to $2 million. Annex E is Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KGF1"
                                >Kennan</persName>’s most recent expression of views.</p>
                        <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0257"/>
                        <p>A summary of the conflicting recommendations follows.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Hamilton</persName> believes there is no justification from
                            an economic point of view for development grants or development loans in
                            any magnitude. He argues that the development grant funds (spent
                            primarily to support U.S. technicians in Yugoslavia and the training of
                            Yugoslavs in the U.S.) are of little economic significance and
                            desperately needed in newer and much less developed countries where an
                            amount of $2.8 million would make a highly significant contribution to
                            development. While he believes that there is a political value attached
                            to bringing these Yugoslav personnel to the U.S., he does not consider
                            this of sufficient importance relative to the usefulness of this money
                            in other areas. He notes that less than one hundred U.S. technicians
                            were sent to Yugoslavia last year under this program and that only three
                            hundred Yugoslavs came here. He observes that Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_KGF1">Kennan</persName> recommends that no new technical
                            assistance contracts of this kind be entered into this year.</p>
                        <p>With regard to development loan funds, Mr. <persName>Hamilton</persName>
                            reasons that other sources of credit are available, that the small
                            amount which the U.S. might make available would not be decisive, and
                            that the need for these funds is incomparably greater in other
                            countries. EUR believes that over the next few years our assistance
                            activities should be phased out and our development lending be replaced
                            by private commercial credits. It recommends, however, that we avoid
                            actions which it feels might be interpreted as abrupt or vindictive.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Hamilton</persName> and EUR agree in the wisdom of
                            continuing P.L. 480 assistance.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Record of Actions also requested
                            that the Department’s recommendations “should rest on a review and

                            proposed review and restatement is Annex B. EUR’s political analysis of
                            Mr. <persName>Hamilton</persName>’s recommendations (Annex D) reasons
                            that termination of all U.S. aid to Yugoslavia at this time (other than
                            P.L. 480) would lead the Yugoslav regime to react strongly to the
                            implied pressures of the U.S. action and would seriously prejudice our
                            relations with that country. It also states that such action would be
                            regarded as a basic change in U.S. policy towards Yugoslavia and might
                            influence other Western countries and private trading interests to take
                            similar action.<note n="3" xml:id="d109fn3">According to a November 16

                            reached on PL 480. We now have under consideration possibility of coming

                            other assistance programs completed.</p>
                        <p>Re your point 1 we think it desirable at time when any PL 480 discussions
                            begin with Yugoslavs to bring up subject <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName>’s November 13 speech seeking clarification obscure
                            references about economic relations with US and making point such
                            statements subject to uncertain construction not helpful to interests

                        <p>Meanwhile we will suggest informally to Yugoslavs here along line of

                            proceed in similar way, desirability avoiding public statements that are
                            misleading or prejudicial US-Yugoslav relations particularly while we
                            are trying to work out solutions to problems in our economic
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>Re point 2 we believe public statement of type you suggest should be
                            deferred until PL 480 agreement concluded if decision taken for such
                            agreement. We have already released to press full information on sale of
                            aircraft and given material on grant aid to number of correspondents who
                            have made inquiries. Secretary’s press statement October 18 already
                            makes point US not using aid to purchase agreement from Yugoslavs with
                            our views.</p>
                        <p>Re point 3 we have carried facts of US assistance programs and US
                            official statements re Yugoslavia over media to Yugoslavia and plan to
                            continue do so as our future actions warrant.<note n="3"

                        <p>We have virtually completed within the Department the reexamination of
                            United States policy towards Yugoslavia. In essence, our review reflects
                            that the United States policy, maintained since 1949, of assisting
                            Yugoslavia to build a firm base of national independence and of exerting
                            our influence upon the evolution of the Yugoslav system has shown
                            striking successes. Yugoslavia today maintains its national sovereignty
                            and is wholly independent of Soviet control. Economically and culturally
                            it is tied to the West. Internally, the Yugoslav system remains
                            essentially Communist; but in the years since its break with the Soviet
                            bloc, the system has evolved in the direction of decentralization and
                            liberalization, so that today Yugoslavia bears little resemblance to the
                            model Soviet satellite it was 13 years ago. Internationally, Yugoslavia
                            is more likely to support Soviet positions on international issues, but
                            it does not invariably do so. Its over-all position is more akin to
                            leftist non-aligned countries, such as Indonesia, rather than to Soviet
                            bloc states.</p>
                        <p>Yugoslavia’s principal significance remains that of an independent
                            Communist regime which successfully resisted Soviet imperialism. The
                            dramatic economic growth achieved by this regime, along with the
                            evolution of its system, has fortified its role as a disruptive element
                            in the international Communist movement and as a source of encouragement
                            to nationalist anti-Soviet tendencies in the bloc.</p>

                        <p>Our reexamination concludes that it is important for the United States to
                            continue to pursue basic United States objectives towards Yugoslavia,
                            including the continued development of our economic relations so as to
                            continue to derive benefits from Yugoslavia’s unique position. Our
                            efforts to develop recommendations on specific programs have, however,
                            been complicated by factors which transcend Yugoslavia. Given the
                            world-wide demands on our limited aid resources, we have not yet agreed
                            whether Yugoslavia should be eligible for development-type assistance
                            and if so the amount which should be programmed for Yugoslavia. We are
                            concerned about the impact on our relations with Yugoslavia, as well as
                            on Yugoslavia’s relations with the West, of any abrupt termination of
                            assistance programs. We are planning on consultations with some of our
                            principal allies in this connection. The one program which presents no
                            problems from the viewpoint of available resources concerns sale of
                            agricultural commodities under PL 480. The Department and Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_KGF1">Kennan</persName> strongly believe that
                            we should proceed at this time with agricultural sales under PL 480,
                            irrespective of the decisions taken regarding development-type
                            assist-ance. Moreover, from the viewpoint of timing, it is the question
                            of a PL 480 program that requires immediate consideration. I urge,
                            therefore, that a decision be reached on this matter at once, in advance

                        <p>The large amount of wheat requested in the program results from the poor
                            harvest, complicated by a late summer drought which, for psychological
                            reasons, is affecting the deliveries by peasants.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KGF1">Kennan</persName> has recommended
                            a program which, he estimated, would carry the Yugoslavs through to June
                            30, 1962 without any increase in reserves. Specifically he has
                            recommended a maximum of 500,000 tons of wheat, 5,000 tons of cotton and
                            no tallow or edible oil. The Ambassador has also recommended that the
                            Yugoslavs be informed that we can give no assurance that a PL 480
                            program will be available for them next year and they may therefore wish
                            to take account of this possibility.</p>
                        <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0262"/>
                        <p>The provision of agricultural commodities has represented a major
                            ingredient of our assistance programs to Yugoslavia, over the past
                            eleven years, comprising $1 billion out of the total of $1.3 billion in
                            economic assistance provided to Yugoslavia between 1949 and 1961. By
                            helping to assure the regime of its essential requirements for
                            foodstuffs, we have contributed rather directly to the change in
                            Yugoslav agricultural policy from one of forced collectivization and
                            coercion to a more reasonable policy of voluntary cooperation and
                            incentives.</p>
                        <p>Failure to proceed with a PL 480 agreement at this time will not of
                            itself induce the Yugoslav leadership to return to the old agricultural
                            policies; they might, however, be led to introduce harsher regulations
                            in order to obtain necessary supplies from the peasantry. A more
                            predictable and, from our viewpoint, disturbing effect, is the
                            likelihood that the strain on the Yugoslav balance of payments would
                            lead to a postponement of certain of the trade liberalization measures
                            planned earlier this year in connection with a foreign trade and foreign
                            exchange reform. Since we have provided $100 million in support of this
                            reform, as part of a $285 million multilateral program, such a
                            development would not be in the best interests of the United States.</p>
                        <p>It is our conclusion, therefore, that the United States should provide
                            further PL 480 assistance, although in a somewhat different form from
                            previously. We would recommend the provision under Title I (sales for
                            Yugoslav currency) of up to 500,000 tons of wheat and 30,000 tons of
                            edible oils. Such a program is estimated at about $45 million. This
                            should enable the Yugoslavs to meet their requirements through June 30,
                            1962 with stocks on hand at that date equivalent to one month’s
                            consumption for wheat and two months’ consumption for oils. In view of
                            the tighter cotton supply situation in the United States and its
                            consequent ineligibility under Title I we would propose to finance up to
                            50,000 bales of Yugoslavia’s cotton requirements under Title IV (sales
                            on long-term dollar credit basis). We would similarly offer to supply
                            the 6,000 tons of tallow requested under Title IV. If cotton should
                            become unavailable under Title IV we would propose sale of cotton under
                            normal Commodity Credit Corporation credit terms.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KGF1">Kennan</persName> has also
                            recommended that we inform the Yugoslavs we can give no assurance in
                            regard to PL 480 assistance after this year. In our view it would be
                            advisable to avoid this step since the situation in Yugoslavia may
                            develop so as to make such assistance desirable. Instead we believe it
                            would be more in keeping with our policy interests in Yugoslavia to
                            inform the Yugoslavs of our intention in future years of shifting
                            increasingly away from Title I transactions (sales for local currency)
                            in favor of those under Title IV (sales on a dollar loan basis).</p>

                                >Tito</persName> stated that “certain capitalist circles” in the

                            spreading propaganda against Yugoslavia, saying that every form of aid
                            to Yugoslavia should stop, that the Yugoslavs should not be fed, that
                            wheat should not be sold in our country, that no aircraft should be
                            given to us, that our people should not be admitted there, and so
                            forth.” He charged that economic pressure has thus been brought upon
                            Yugoslavia when it has been severely hit by drought and when it is in an
                            unpleasant situation. <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> went on
                            to say that if no aid were given to Yugoslavia he would be prepared to
                            buy wheat.</p>
                        <p>I agree as you have noted in your memorandum of November 16 that
                                <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s speech complicates
                            matters. I do not believe, however, that our actions should be based
                            solely on what <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> says. His
                            speech was directed primarily to his own people and was probably
                            intended to dispel anxieties arising from the bad drought and reports of
                            a change in United States policy. <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName> was also reflecting sensitivity to the attacks on
                            his regime which have appeared in the United States press. These attacks
                            have engaged his prestige. Further delay in concluding agricultural
                            sales arrangements will undoubtedly aggravate this situation by
                            supporting the view that these attacks represent United States policy.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> may thus be led to take
                            some action which could engage our prestige in a way to make it
                            increasingly difficult if impossible for us to pursue policies which
                            have proven to be in our national interest.</p>
                        <p>Despite <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s recent statements on
                            economic relations with the United States which tend to be obscure on
                            some points, I believe we should proceed as soon as possible to inform
                            the Yugoslavs of our readiness to provide wheat and other available
                            agricultural commodities. Otherwise unnecessary damage may be done to
                            United States-Yugoslav relations and to the position we have built up in
                            Yugoslavia.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName corresp="#p_KGF1"
                                >George</persName></hi>: We have been giving much thought to our
                            exchange of correspondence—my letter of October 12 and yours of October
                                27<note n="1" xml:id="d113fn1"><ref target="#d102">Document
                                    102</ref> and the attachment to <ref target="#d106"
                                >106</ref>.</note>—which go into the basis and rationale of our
                            policy toward Yugoslavia and the assistance programs associated with
                            that policy. There is a great deal in common in our views particularly
                            where both of us come out as regards recommendations for various types
                            of economic assist-ance. In this regard there is more agreement between
                            you and EUR than between either of us and the Director of <gloss
                                target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>. Yet certain differences exist in each
                            of our approaches. Some of these differences are due perhaps to semantic
                            difficulties in finding the same meaning in a given description or in
                            our failure to develop sufficiently certain concepts in my last letter.
                            In this letter I shall try to reach more common ground by developed
                            explanation and, hopefully, reduce those differences that appear at
                            first sight to exist.</p>
                        <p>We took the position that our basic policy toward Yugoslavia is a good
                            one, a successful policy over the years, and that it should not be
                            abandoned or changed in a fundamental way. This did not mean that it
                            must always remain identical in scope or details, in implementation, and
                            in courses of action from year to year. Our EUR concept would permit
                            adjustments as circumstances require—adjustments to take account of
                            developments in Yugoslavia or to express our reaction, when necessary in
                            our own interest, to moves of the Yugoslav Government. But this, as we
                            see it, is not a change in our basic policy as presented in my October
                            12 letter and in our EUR policy review (copy of which I enclosed in my
                            last letter). In fact since 1949 we have had our ups and downs in
                            relations with the Yugoslavs and we have made those tactical adjustments
                            as required. It is also true that our assistance activities have varied
                            considerably from time to time to take account of new developments and
                            we do not believe that the Yugoslavs have a basis for taking for granted
                            the continuation of certain types and amounts of assistance. The
                            continuation of our basic policy does not by any means require the
                            continuation of economic programs without change. We believe, therefore,
                            and I think there is agreement in the Department at least outside <gloss
                                target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> that the basic aspects of our policy
                            (in premises and purposes) should continue.</p>
                        <pb n="243" xml:id="pg_243" facs="0265"/>
                        <p>As to Yugoslavia’s independent position we have never questioned that it
                            is determined today to remain separate from the bloc and we see no
                            prospect unless a great change occurs in the international situation of
                            its going back to Moscow on the old terms of subordination. It is
                            difficult to believe however that Yugoslavia will not need some
                            assistance to take care of contingencies such as the present food
                            stringency created by the severe crop conditions or to adjust its
                            institutions to the requirements of a market economy as in the extensive
                            credits by the West in support of Yugoslavia’s reform of its foreign
                            trade and exchange rate systems. The consolidation of its independence
                            and economic development in our view necessitates at this juncture still
                            some support from the West.</p>
                        <p>The Department has never thought that Yugoslavia should become
                            economically dependent on the US with the expectation of receiving the
                            same forms and amounts of assistance indefinitely. We find it hard to
                            believe that the Yugoslavs have this expectation or desire this although
                            we gather from our experience here that they are not unhappy to receive
                            aid from the US in the form of credits and PL 480 sales. In fact they
                            seem anxious to get it when they need it and give evidence of
                            appreciating such forms of assistance. They have undoubtedly not wanted
                            certain kinds of assistance at various times—for example military grant
                            aid in 1957 and technical assistance in the beginning. We feel sure too
                            that they would like to be in the fortunate position, just as would any
                            nonaligned state, where they would need no assistance at all from other
                            countries. In our judgment their attitude toward receiving assistance
                            from the Soviet bloc in 1956 was about the same. They show, whatever
                            they may say in public speeches, that they know very well we extend
                            assistance to their country for political purposes of our own national
                            interest rather than for some reasons of internal necessity.</p>
                        <p>In any event our purpose is not to continue various assistance programs
                            for an indefinite period but to move gradually as soon as circumstances
                            permit toward a basically commercial relationship. We would do so in a
                            manner to perpetuate worthwhile activities on a self-sustaining basis
                            and to keep doors open to essential modes of access to the
                            Yugoslavs.</p>
                        <p>You have yourself recommended against abrupt termination of assistance
                            and with this we agree. The sudden withdrawal or drastic reduction of
                            aid by the US would not be limited to the effects of our government
                            action. Other Western countries would probably be guided to a great
                            extent by our example and the actions of governments would influence
                            private bankers and traders. The total result might well do considerable
                            damage to the Yugoslav economic position. If the West generally was to
                            take a negative attitude toward Yugoslavia, the repercussions might
                            drive Yugoslavia back toward some kind of close connection with the bloc
                            particularly if the policies of the bloc should <pb n="244"
                                xml:id="pg_244" facs="0266"/>become less conservative with Soviet
                            acceptance of increasing national autonomy in the bloc and if the bloc
                            held out the promise of economic aid. The bloc did the latter in 1956
                            and so this does not appear to be a farfetched possibility. In these
                            circumstances Yugoslavia might conceivably become a member of a kind of
                            a Communist Commonwealth. It is any chance of such an eventuality
                            involving Yugoslavia’s virtual return to the bloc which we seek to
                            avoid.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the present direction of Yugoslavia’s institutional
                            developments, we believe the evolution of the internal system and
                            Yugoslavia’s network of relations with the West, which are becoming
                            institutionalized, are moving Yugoslavia constantly toward a closer and
                            broader association with the West. These developments serve to
                            consolidate Yugoslavia’s independent status and make it irreversible. We
                            think we should assist these tendencies and certainly not take actions
                            that might check, impede or decelerate them for an indefinite
                            period.</p>
                        <p>As we have considered this problem over and over, we end by finding no
                            alternative basic policy that will bring such advantages to the US from
                            the standpoint of our long range interests. We still think this to be
                            the case taking into account the present international situation, the
                            stage of Yugoslavia’s development and the policies of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> government. Concerning the last, we
                            find no fundamental change in the recent attitude of the Yugoslav
                            Government on international issues. <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName>’s speech at the Belgrade Conference struck us as
                            setting forth essentially his traditional line except for two important
                            points: (1) his condoning of Soviet resumption of nuclear testing and
                            (2) the assertion that some powers were making a fetish of controls as a
                            pretext for avoiding disarmament. On these points the speech was
                            particularly objectionable to the US and chiefly for this reason the
                            Department suggested that you make vigorous representations at Belgrade.
                            In our view the US in addition should have shown displeasure by some
                            delay and some reduction in extending assistance. This was one of the
                            principal reasons for our pressing for a reduction in developmental
                            lending from $25–30 million as contained in the Congressional
                            presentation to $15–20 million as submitted in the EUR recommendation to
                            the Secretary. We would also have deferred the PL 480 discussions long
                            enough, although probably not so long as has actually been the case, to
                            support and reenforce the representations you made.</p>
                        <p>We fully appreciate your view as set forth in your despatch of July
                                20<note n="2" xml:id="d113fn2">Reference is to despatch 41; see <ref

                            there should have been adjustments in economic assistance to Yugoslavia
                            in any event. We go along with the view that assistance should be
                            adjusted from year to year as the circumstances indicate. Our <pb

                        <p>We come now to a point where EUR sees things differently from your view.
                            You say “There can be no question but that Yugoslav policy, like that of
                            Moscow, is aimed generally at the frustration of US efforts in the cold
                            war and the elimination of our country as a major factor in world
                            affairs.” and again: “ … and we may demand from them the evidence that
                            they feel some concern for the preservation of our power and influence
                            as a factor in world affairs.”<note n="3" xml:id="d113fn3">Ellipsis in
                                the source text.</note> If Yugoslav policy were like that of Moscow
                            in seeking the elimination of the power and influence of the US as a
                            factor in world affairs we would find no reason to extend any assistance
                            whatsoever to Yugoslavia any more than to the Soviet Union itself or to
                            a complete satellite like Bulgaria. It seems to us that an appraisal of
                            Yugoslav policy in this way leads to the inescapable conclusion that the
                            US should treat Yugoslavia only as a full satellite member of the bloc
                            and follow the same general policy toward Yugoslavia as toward the
                            Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>In our dealings with Yugoslavs here we have not found this to be their
                            attitude nor can we read <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s
                            speeches to imply the desire to eliminate the US as a power factor. This
                            would not be in the interest of the Yugoslavs since it would leave the
                            Soviet Union the supreme power in the world and in a position then to
                            proceed with its apparent long standing objective in dealing with the
                            heretic regime at Belgrade. It is our impression that the Yugoslavs
                            realize clearly that their position of independence in the world depends
                            in the last analysis on the essential balance of power between the US
                            and the Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> and
                            other high Yugoslav leaders doubtless desire to see socialism triumph as
                            a system but we gain the impression that many of the lower echelons and
                            younger Yugoslavs do not have the same interest in this development.</p>
                        <p>To be sure, on international issues the Yugoslav Government takes, and
                            will doubtless continue to take, a position different from ours in most
                            instances. In fact this attitude including <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName>’s recent expressions of anti-Westernism is not in
                            any sense new. This is partly because they are communist and partly
                            because they are neutralist. The score can be counted in the UN and
                            there they usually line up with India, Indonesia and the UAR. Sometimes
                            in fact India causes us more trouble. We fully appreciate of course the
                            unalterable Marxism of <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> and
                            his desire to see socialism spread everywhere together with his
                            conviction that it will.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the question of our influence on Yugoslavia’s development a
                            powerful force is certainly at work in Yugoslavia’s evolving situation
                            making for pragmatic departures from the Soviet model. At the <pb
                                n="246" xml:id="pg_246" facs="0268"/>same time we are convinced that
                            our exchanges and contacts with the Yugoslavs, many of which have
                            depended on our economic assistance, have had an important formative
                            effect on the evolution of the Yugoslav system since 1949. The
                            Yugoslavs, we agree, do not shape their institutions or plans in order
                            to get our economic assistance. In receiving our assistance however they
                            have made numerous visits to institutions, organizations and plants in
                            the US and bought many of our products. They have developed continuing
                            contacts with individuals, firms and institutions. They have had a
                            chance to be exposed to this vast country and its great economic system.
                            They have been influenced, whatever their interests or wishes. We have
                            seen this time and again in talking with them here. This is especially
                            true as regards the middle and lower echelons who will step into
                            influential positions in the future—ones who desire to make changes and
                            move ahead. Technical assistance, which is mostly an exchange program,
                            has perhaps most of all provided a channel for this kind of influence to
                            make itself felt.</p>
                        <p>Then too with the assistance from us and other Western countries the
                            Yugoslavs can take steps to change their system in a Western sense which
                            they could not otherwise do so soon or at all. In agriculture it seems
                            clear to us that our assistance has actually relieved the lot of the
                            peasantry (as well as of the population as a whole); otherwise in the
                            effort to achieve large unit efficiency of operation the regime might
                            well have applied pressure for collectivization by administrative means.
                            We are frankly at a loss to understand to what you refer in saying that
                            our PL 480 transactions allow Yugoslavia to indulge in ideological
                            experiments in agriculture or to cease efforts to increase agricultural
                            productivity. We had thought that the Yugoslavs had made considerable
                            progress for a communist country in increasing agricultural production
                            through the introduction of new seeds, the use of machines and
                            fertilizers, and the utilization of peasant incentive. The Yugoslavs
                            still have a way to go in achieving a rational price system and, of
                            course, they still have not licked the problem of weather.</p>
                        <p>We are puzzled by the comment that one of the results of our extensive
                            aid has been to relieve the Yugoslavs of the necessity for coming to
                            grips with the problem of their economic relations with Western Europe.
                            We had rather understood that they had built up extensive and healthy
                            economic relations with Western Europe, a development which the US has
                            welcomed and encouraged over the years as a means of associating them
                            more closely with the West. We had believed that our assistance had
                            contributed to this favorable growth. The trade between Yugoslavia on
                            the one side and Western Germany and Italy on the other, for example,
                            has expanded greatly and we hope it will continue to flourish. We
                            realize that the Yugoslavs have constant balance of payment problems,
                            yet these seem due to their extensive investment, <pb n="247"
                                xml:id="pg_247" facs="0269"/>procurement of capital equipment abroad
                            and rapid economic growth rather than to essential weakness of the
                            national economy. They naturally push for the sake of these interests
                            their balance of payments margins to the limit and they could reduce the
                            scope of their problem if they were to limit the rate of their capital
                            expansion.</p>
                        <p>The Yugoslav activities in the underdeveloped countries are also a matter
                            of interest and concern to us. While granting there is a political
                            purpose in these activities, we do not overlook the economic motive as
                            well. The rapidly growing Yugoslav industrial output demands markets and
                            they are not in a position to compete so well in Western markets as
                            Western industries since they have broken away only in part from the
                            noncompetitive features of the typical communist system. Their capital
                            and technical products however are desired in the markets of the
                            underdeveloped countries but can be purchased in any quantity only on
                            the basis of long term credit. Hence we would see in the extension of
                            such credits for the sale of capital goods to underdeveloped countries
                            partly a desire of the Yugoslavs to find markets for their products.
                            Although we would certainly not wish to promote Yugoslavia’s role in
                            this area, if any communist country has to trade with these
                            underdeveloped countries it seems better for Yugoslavia to do it than
                            for one of the bloc countries. We have seen in a number of instances
                            Yugoslav competition with bloc countries in Africa and the Middle East.
                            Moreover, there is good evidence that one of the things the Yugoslavs do
                            in the underdeveloped countries is to point out the danger of becoming
                            economically dependent upon the Soviets and the Chinese Communists.</p>
                        <p>As I come to the end of an already long letter I feel that if one or two
                            of the principal points made in your letter are valid, no justification
                            exists for extending any further assistance to Yugoslavia and for the
                            continuance of our basic policy toward Yugoslavia. We cannot feel that
                            this should be our conclusion. We think we have gained important
                            benefits from that basic policy and continue to do so. We do not get all
                            we would like out of Yugoslavia’s situation. It is a communist state but
                            not like the bloc states; it has evolved a long way from being the model
                            satellite it was in 1948. The doctrinal cleavage between even <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> and Moscow over separate roads to
                            socialism and a system involving more humanistic, individualistic and
                            pragmatic concepts is deep. And <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName> is not Yugoslavia. There are different Yugoslavias;
                            they are changing and I am sure will continue to change. We should do
                            what seems basic to our long range interests to assist this evolution in
                            a Western direction and to win the younger generation in support of this
                            evolution. That perhaps is the essence of our views on our policy toward
                            Yugoslavia.</p>

                        <p>On December 13, 1961, Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_KGF1">Kennan</persName>
                            and I went to tea with Vice President <persName corresp="#p_KE1">Edvard
                                Kardelj</persName> and his wife, at their invitation. Tea was
                            offered at their own home. The only other people present were Mr.
                                <persName>Leo Mates</persName>, Assistant Secretary of State for
                            Foreign Affairs, and Mrs. <persName>Mates</persName>. After tea with the
                            ladies, the men withdrew and we had a long discussion of Yugoslav
                            foreign policy and Yugoslav-American relations. We remained in
                            conversation, in all, for three hours. While the ladies spoke English,
                            my own conversation with <persName corresp="#p_KE1">Kardelj</persName>
                            was mostly in Russian, occasionally in English.</p>
                        <p>One of the subjects discussed was American aid. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KE1">Kardelj</persName> expressed the hope that within
                            two or three years Yugoslavia would be substantially self-supporting in
                            wheat and would require no further extensive PL 480 aid. Serious
                            mistakes had been made this year in handling the problem of subventions
                            in connection with agricultural production. They had ceased too early to
                            prime the pump. These mistakes were now being corrected. He was fairly
                            confident the results would be effective. However, the effects of this
                            summer’s drought would be even more severe in 1962 than it was in 1961,
                            so too much could not be expected from the 1962 harvest.</p>
                        <p>As for the other forms of aid, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KE1"
                                >Kardelj</persName> attached high value to the <gloss
                                target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> loans. With respect to the work of
                            private relief organizations, he showed no particular interest. I doubt
                            that he knew what I was talking about. As to Technical Assistance, he
                            thought that this should not be considered a permanent feature of United
                            States-Yugoslav relations. He felt, however, that there was a particular
                            need at this time for Technical Assistance in the field of agricultural
                            economics.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KE1">Kardelj</persName> did not conceal Yugoslav
                            disappointment with Khru-shchev’s failure to reciprocate the support
                            they had tried to give him in major questions of world affairs. The
                            Yugoslavs had come recently to suspect that he was actually embarrassed
                            by their efforts. He was inclined to regret that Vukmanovic-Tempo had
                            been sent to the WFTU meeting in Moscow. He thought this had been
                            premature.</p>

                            in adequate support in the Soviet Apparat. His real strength lay in his
                            sense of touch with the common people. The Soviet-Chinese conflict, he
                            thought, was too profound ever to be entirely healed. It would
                            inevitably become deeper in the future.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_KE1">Kardelj</persName> of our unhappiness
                            over the anti-Western and anti-American extremisms of the Yugoslav
                            press. <persName corresp="#p_KE1">Kardelj</persName> did not deny that
                            there had been distortions here. I gathered he proposed to use his
                            influence to improve matters. [The editor of <hi rend="italic"

                        <p>The Yugoslavs had plainly been stung by the Secretary’s statement on
                            September 18 that Yugoslavia had had a divisive influence on world
                            communism, and was a source of dissension within the communist bloc.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KE1">Kardelj</persName> pleaded that we should
                            regard Yugoslavia as a country with which our relations were worth
                            cultivating for its own sake, and not as an instrument to be used for
                            tactical purposes. I said that this represented my own growing
                            conviction, as I lived and learned in this country. I hoped the
                            Yugoslavs, too, would learn to see in the United States something more
                            than a bargaining backstop for their relations with Russia.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s speeches were not mentioned.
                            I sensed that the Yugoslavs wished only that these should now be
                            forgotten.</p>
                        <p>In general, the interview was exceptionally cordial. In my opinion, it
                            unquestionably marks a sincere effort to repair fences in our
                            direction.</p>

                                            >Popovic</persName> said it was his conviction
                                        Yugoslav-US relations were actually much better than they
                                        appeared on surface to be; Yugoslav-Soviet relations, on
                                        other hand, much worse. Split of 1948 had run deeper than
                                        most of us in West realized. Never had chances for complete
                                        understanding between Yugoslavia and USSR been poorer than
                                        today. As example of Western misreading this situation he
                                        cited Sulzberger story of rumored Soviet-Yugoslav deal over
                                        Albania and said this reflected fantastic misunderstanding
                                        real nature Yugoslav-Albanian relations. He inferred any
                                        such thing was far beyond realm of political possibility. On
                                        my reminding him of abundant evidence of Yugoslav concern
                                        for Soviet opinion and on emotional involvement of leading
                                        Yugoslavs with affairs of Socialist world, he said this
                                        represented form of pro-Russian romanticism which had both
                                        traditional and more recently political roots, which was a
                                        passing phenomenon and not in accord basic trends Yugoslav
                                        society, by which we should not be misled. As Socialists
                                        they had to regard Russian revolution and subsequent
                                        emergence of bloc of Socialist countries as something which,
                                        whether or not fortuitous in origin, was now permanent fact
                                        of international life. They were more concerned than we were
                                        with what occurred within this bloc, regarded Soviet
                                        Communism as preferable to Chinese and <persName
                                            corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> as preferable to
                                        other Russian Communists. Within their possibilities, they
                                        acted accordingly.</p>
                                    <p>With obvious but not specific reference <persName

                                        pleaded that we not attach long-term significance to things
                                        said within context of a specific moment and for achievement
                                        of momentary effect. He had recently had bitter arguments
                                        with Yugoslav editors over their tendency to make this same
                                        mistake.</p></item>

                                <item>Germany. He agreed readily that Yugoslav press had recently
                                    been guilty of much extremism in treatment German problems.
                                    German press reaction to Vracaric case<note n="1"
                                        xml:id="d115fn1">On November 11, 1961, Yugoslav authorities
                                        arrested a West German businessman, L. Vracaric, and charged
                                        him with war crimes. Following protests from the West German

                                    many positive items [but?] Yugoslav press had failed to mention
                                    them. For this, too, he <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0273"
                                    />had taken editors to task, pointing out by this tendentious
                                    treatment they were encouraging precisely those tendencies they
                                    feared in Western Germany. He thought the truth lay somewhere
                                    between Yugoslav exaggeration dangers German militarism and our
                                    underestimation of it. He spoke so eloquently of folly of
                                    Yugoslavia’s attempting to take upon herself task of combatting
                                    nationalistic trends in Germany that I suspect he was personally
                                    responsible for recent change Yugoslav press line this subject.
                                    In this connection he mentioned particularly damage to German
                                    tourist traffic in Yugoslavia and other economic exchanges
                                    resulting from Yugoslav polemics.</item>

                                <item>Ustashi activities. I confessed my own chagrin over activities
                                    Ustashi and other violent elements in US interested in
                                    embarrassing Yugoslav-US relations and explained to him
                                    difficulties we had in controlling this problem. He said while
                                    he would personally place this perhaps 17th on list of
                                    US-Yugoslav difficulties there were many others who would place
                                    it much higher and I was right to give it importance. Since he
                                    mentioned Artukovic, I said I could not conceive that Yugoslavia
                                    wanted an Eichmann case of its own at this moment, or that
                                    US-Yugoslav relations would be benefited by Artukovic’s forced
                                    return to Yugoslavia. To this he readily assented, said we would
                                    notice Yugoslavs had refrained from exploiting Eichmann trial in
                                    this connection. However, Artukovic would continue for long to
                                    rankle in many Yugoslav minds. Some people would never
                                    understand how we could harbor such a person if we ourselves
                                    wished well to Yugoslavia. He added incidentally there were now
                                    evidences of Ustashi infiltration in French OAS as well as other
                                    European neo-Fascist activities.</item>

                                <item>Colonialism. On this subject we were farthest from agreement.
                                    In response my statement we would prefer to see more use

                                    Colonialism, he said this would lead to impossible fragmentation
                                    of Africa and other areas. World had no choice but to create
                                    boundaries artificially and encourage formation larger national

                                    oversimplification of extremely complex Yugoslav position. Cold
                                    war interfered this way not only in our relations, but also in

                            exchange of amenities the Ambassador began the conversation by thanking
                            the Secretary for the decision to proceed with the negotiations on PL
                            480 assistance. He said the food made available to Yugoslavia under the
                            agreement just concluded was of great assistance to his country. The
                            Secretary replied that the US was happy to be able to proceed on this
                            matter despite opposition in some quarters to US assistance in any form.
                            After outlining in some detail the basis of Yugoslavia’s foreign policy,
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Nikezic</persName> informed the
                            Secretary that he was leaving Washington on January 15 to return to
                            Belgrade for a period of three to four weeks consultation. He said he
                            was certain that on his return he would be asked by Yugoslav authorities
                            about the extent to which the US is prepared to accept Yugoslavia as a
                            non-aligned country which is pursuing an independent foreign policy. He
                            said Belgrade would also be interested in the US attitude towards
                            Yugoslavia’s requests for further economic assistance.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that Yugoslavia’s independence is just as important
                            in the US view now as it has always been in the past. The US does not
                            expect Yugoslavia to side with the West. Yugoslavia’s non-alignment, and
                            for that matter the non-alignment of other countries, is satisfactory to
                            the United States. From time to time as US-Yugoslav relations develop
                            one is likely to touch on an exposed nerve of the other. That there are
                            differences between the US and Yugoslavia is a political fact of life.
                            We have, for example, different views on Berlin, and Cuba, which the
                            Yugoslavs regard in a different light, is of special concern to the US.
                            These differences, however, do not place any insurmountable obstacles in
                            the way of the development of positive and friendly relations. The
                            underlying fact of importance is that Yugoslavia is working out its own
                            national future as it sees fit.</p>
                        <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0275"/>
                        <p>As far as economic assistance is concerned, the Secretary said that the
                            organization of the new agency <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and
                            the necessity to take into account new legislation had slowed down
                            consideration of Yugo-slavia’s requests. We are currently engaged in a
                            review of all of our continuing economic programs, including those of
                            several allied countries, such as Norway, Denmark, Greece, and Turkey.
                            We want to make our future programs more efficient by profiting from the
                            experience of the last fifteen years. As the Ambassador is undoubtedly
                            aware, many new demands are being made on US assistance resources,
                            particularly from the under-developed areas. We hope to have a decision
                            soon on the Yugoslav requests which must be weighed against those of
                            other countries and in the light of the total resources available.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently, during the course of the conversation Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM1">Nikezic</persName> made the following points: (1)
                            the USSR had opposed the calling of the Belgrade Conference and had
                            worked actively through Guinea and Cuba to sabotage it; (2) Yugoslavia
                            should be accepted for itself and not as an instrument to be used in the
                            cold war; and (3) he agreed with the Secretary’s point that the US and
                            Yugoslavia should find ways to cooperate on things which they have in
                            common and to insulate themselves where they do not.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed at one point that he felt the Yugoslavs had a
                            tendency to regard the USSR as sensitive and the US as not. For this
                            reason, Yugoslavia tends to take the US too much for granted too often.
                            The point is, he said, that the US should not be pushed too far.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Nikezic</persName> remarked wryly
                            that after the Belgrade Conference he did not believe that the Yugoslavs
                            would be inclined soon again to abuse US tolerance.</p>
                        <p>In closing the discussion of US-Yugoslav relations Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM1">Nikezic</persName> said that the Yugoslavs had
                            analyzed US actions during and after the Belgrade Conference. He had
                            discussed US reaction to the Belgrade Conference with Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> during his last visit
                            to this country. They had concluded that Yugoslavia’s action at the time
                            of the Conference had been interpreted in this country as evidence of a
                            shift in Yugoslav foreign policy. He wished to emphasize that no shift
                            had taken place in Yugoslav foreign policy. The truth of this assertion,
                            he declared, would be borne out by an objective analysis of
                            Soviet-Yugoslav relations.</p>

                                    willingness of the U.S. Government, as a transitional measure,
                                    to accept further loan applications for consideration. Within
                                    the U.S. Government it would be understood that loan assistance
                                    would be in the range of $10 million to $20 million of which the

                            though not an inordinate one, to achieve this. This does of course

                        <p>1283. From several indications we gain impression Yugoslav leaders are
                            just now in throes of some sort of crisis of decision with possible
                            far-reaching implications for both domestic and foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>We are reliably informed that last week’s session of expanded plenum
                            party executive committee under <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName>’s chairmanship was devoted entirely to considering
                            Yugoslavia’s economic plight and its many bitter implications. No
                            decisions have yet been announced, and it is possible no final ones have
                            yet been taken.</p>

                        <p>Am confident that policy of economic liberalization which prevailed
                            throughout 60 and most of 61 is now under heavy critical pressure; and

                                corresp="#p_TM1">Todorovic</persName> may be affected.</p>
                        <p>It is plain that barring some new major source of external assistance
                            severe restrictive measures will have to be taken to bring economy
                            better under control and improve finance external payments. These
                            measures will presumably affect adversely both living standards and rate
                            of growth. But even this will probably be insufficient to meet external
                            payments problem which, as recently reported, is now assuming serious
                            forms, particularly in inability of government to meet promptly current
                            external obligations and to assure adequate imports raw materials and
                            component parts for Yugoslav export industries.</p>
                        <p>Leading Yugoslavs have recently shown themselves preoccupied and more
                            reticent than usual about major problems Yugoslav policy. Efforts to get

                            program for 62 has been pending for nearly two months with no reply.
                            Attempts to elicit even informal comment unsuccessful. Although some
                            textile factories are understood reduced to 30 percent capacity
                            operation for lack raw material, we have now been waiting nearly three
                            weeks for reply our offer to make available 50,000 bales under Title IV,
                            PL 480. External debt statement, which has repeatedly been promised us
                            since December 1960 and which they know would be helpful to us in
                            meeting applications developmental loans, still not forthcoming. We have
                            no evidence Yugoslavs have yet made their wishes fully clear to <gloss
                                target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> or Export-Import Bank. They have as yet
                            given us nothing specific here. Yesterday they finally rejected
                            long-standing Canadian offer to help with construction oil refinery at
                            Pancevo, although they are just in throes of sending high-powered
                            commercial delegation to Canada to stimulate trade. All in all their
                            behavior is hesitant and partly contradictory, and contrasts sharply
                            with eagerness for Western aid they might normally be expected to show
                            in present difficult situation.</p>
                        <p>Have noted no particular signs of irritation against our government, this
                            mission, or myself personally. They seldom take initiative in
                            communicating with us; but this is standard practice. Have not even had
                            any direct complaints re curtailment of <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                >AID</gloss> programs, though there have been various warning hints
                            that in circumstances they would have to look elsewhere, including
                            eastwards, for help. Have impression they realize our present plans

                        <p>Possible hypotheses recent Yugoslav behavior are these: (1) that
                                <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>, having been preoccupied
                            with Africa and relations with unaligned nations throughout 61 and until
                            end February 62, has only recently become aware full seriousness balance
                            of payments situation, and has put some sort moratorium on current
                            decisions, particularly those involving new obligations, until future
                            policy course fully determined. (2) That Yugoslavs are preparing some
                            major appeal to Western countries and international organizations to
                            increase their maneuverability in dealing with their present payments
                            situation, and detailed decisions being held up pending completion this
                            approach. (3) That discussions or soundings are being taken with
                            Russians, in deference to which other decisions, particularly ones
                            concerning us, are being held in abeyance. I think we must be prepared
                            for possibility that in light narrowing dimensions our assistance, and
                            increasing severity financial terms, Yugoslavs may be approaching point
                            where they would appreciably facilitate achievement of alternative
                            solutions. I personally do not see much probability of this last at
                            present time. Yugoslavs are clearly disturbed and miffed over continued
                            failure <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to return
                                <persName corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> visit. Their pride is
                            such that I cannot conceive their going to Moscow as supplicants for
                            economic aid so long as this courtesy is being withheld. But their
                            distress is so acute that no one can entirely vouch for their conduct.
                            And it may of course be that a date for <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> visit has been fixed confidentially but not yet

                        <p>Since this is my day for candor, I might just as well exploit it.</p>
                        <p>I read Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KGF1">Kennan</persName>’s
                            telegram No. 1397 with some dismay. While most of his facts are probably
                            indisputable, his conclusions are questionable.</p>
                        <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261" facs="0283"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KGF1">Kennan</persName> clearly has a personal
                            problem with <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>, probably not
                            unrelated to the Belgrade Conference experience and it seems to color
                            many of his conclusions.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador argues that as long as <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName> is on the scene, our relations with Yugoslavia will
                            remain difficult. I do not disagree but I would go further. As I see it,
                            as long as a Communist regime is in power in Belgrade, our relations
                            with Yugoslavia will be difficult. <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName> obviously governs Yugoslavia but there is no
                            evidence to support the view that our problems with Communist Yugoslavia
                            will end with <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s departure. We
                            can live with this situation.</p>
                        <p>There are also certain curious details in the Ambassador’s commentary. He
                            sees this as a peculiarly propitious time for a Soviet-Yugoslav
                            rapprochement, yet he goes on to say that although there is evident
                            Yugoslav eagerness, this is not reciprocated by the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador also noticeably avoids any discussion of the recent
                            Sino-Soviet developments and talks in terms of this problem as it
                            appeared several months ago. The fact is that so long as Moscow and
                            Peiking can arrive at some modus vivendi, <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName>’s maneuverability in playing the Soviets against
                            the Chinese is clearly limited.</p>
                        <p>In my view the most troublesome element in <persName corresp="#p_KGF1"
                                >Kennan</persName>’s message is that he seems to be carefully
                            building up a case for a basic revision in our Yugoslav policy. The
                            direction in which his thinking seems to be going is that so long as
                                <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> is looking increasingly
                            toward Moscow and the Bloc, the United States should take a second look
                            at its commitments to Belgrade.</p>
                        <p>There is nothing wrong in reexamining our policy and the considerations
                            that went into making that policy. But we should also recognize that our
                            policy has not been directed at converting Yugoslav political thinking,
                            but rather in keeping it tied, to the extent possible, to the West and
                            thereby limiting its dependence on the Soviet Bloc. That policy has been
                            successful. Therefore, before we begin to move off this line, I think we
                            should be certain that we are not doing the very thing that concerns us
                            most—pushing Yugoslavia closer to the Bloc.</p>

                        <p>1459. Appearance of twenty newly acquired Soviet tanks of fairly recent
                            vintage and one Soviet-type assault gun at May Day parade here has
                            naturally aroused much comment among four [<hi rend="italic"
                                >foreign</hi>?] observers, since with exception of a few helicopters
                            these are the first major item of military equipment known to have been
                            acquired here from Soviet sources since 1948. While authentic
                            information is not available, we think it likely that acquisition these
                            items dates back to tension in US-Yugo relations following Belgrade
                            conference and to difficulty encountered by Yugos at that time in
                            discussing further deals for purchase US military equipment. Lack of
                            dollars and other Western currencies, and existence unused clearing
                            balance with Soviet Union, may have been further Yugo motive for
                            purchase Soviet tanks. Perhaps equally or more significant than Yugo
                            willingness to purchase Soviet tanks is Soviet readiness to supply them
                            to Yugos. Other neutral states besides Yugo have received Soviet
                            weapons, but since 1948 Soviet Union has not been willing send military
                            equipment here. Having purchased these items, it is probable, in order
                            to avoid offending Russians. There are also signs, however, of a
                            deliberate desire in some Yugo quarters to make a demonstration of some
                            sort in exhibiting these items. While Yugo military circles deny that
                            this signifies any change in Yugo political or military <pb n="264"
                                xml:id="pg_264" facs="0286"/>policy, we think Yugo Government may
                            not have been averse in trying to arouse in Western circles some alarm
                            over results of relative cold-shoulder which Western countries have
                            recently turned to Yugo and her needs with respect to credit and
                            facilities for military purchases.</p>
                        <p>On top of this <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> yesterday
                            morning, May 2, just prior to his departure for Split (purpose not
                            announced) received Soviet Ambassador Yepishev and conducted with him,
                            according to official announcement, a long conversation. This deserves
                            careful attention. Yepishev had accompanied <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> back to Moscow on April 21. He appears to have
                            returned Belgrade April 30, evidently demanded urgent interview with
                                <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> and was fitted into
                            latter’s schedule at only possible point between strenuous May Day
                            ceremonies and departure Dalmatia later Wednesday morning. Conclusion
                            inescapable that Soviet Government, after receiving <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s report on visit, decided to
                            make further communication of urgent nature to <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>. This could have been, and in my
                            view most probably was, effort to enlist Yugo support and influence with
                            neutrals for some new Soviet move re testing (Department Circular
                            telegram 1857).<note n="1" xml:id="d124fn1">Circular telegram 1857,
                                April 30, reported Soviet efforts to call a special session of the
                                General Assembly on disarmament. (Ibid., 700.00(S)/4–3062)</note>
                            But we must remember Yugos had evidently pressed hard and vainly during
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> visit for discussions
                            on economic problems. Information now available indicates with fair
                            degree reliability Yugos urged, in particular, that special negotiations
                            be instituted at relatively high political level to discuss closer
                            association Yugo with COMECON.</p>
                        <p>While Russians would scarcely be so crude as to couple these two things
                            explicitly for bargaining purposes, there are many ways to skin such a
                            cat. Yugo financial distress is acute. So is concern here over effects
                            on Yugo of Common Market. XXII Congress and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> visit have unquestionably whetted <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s hopes for accommodation with Bloc
                            on terms that would not require Yugo concessions on party-ideological
                            plane. While he would probably like retain outwardly good relations with
                            West to extent possible, he would, in my opinion, sacrifice much even in
                            terms of relations with US to obtain accommodation on such terms. In
                            such circumstances must reiterate we can take nothing for granted
                            concerning Yugo policies in coming period.</p>

                            said, that official American circles had not been involved;
                            nevertheless, there had been certain Americans who had had an interest

                        <p>We did not go into this further. I now think it unlikely that anything

                        <p>During his visit to Washington the Yugoslav State Secretary for Foreign
                            Affairs, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PK1">Koca Popovic</persName>, met
                            with the President today for 70 minutes in a frank discussion
                            principally concerning US-Yugoslav relations, Soviet-Yugoslav relations,
                            and Yugoslav positions on international issues.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President’s question about his trip to Latin America,
                            the Foreign Minister said that he was very interested in the process of
                            development in the countries visited; Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, and
                            Mexico. He agreed with the President on the vitality and dynamism in the
                            development of Brazil, where there was a growth rate of 4 to 5% a year
                            in spite of great inflation, in contrast to the stability but depression
                            in Bolivia.</p>
                        <p>The President asked where the US and Yugoslavia were going together and
                            what was the prognosis and prospects for our relations. He subsequently
                            raised a number of subsidiary questions related to this theme.</p>
                        <p>The Minister thought that our relations were not bad and were developing.
                            Because of the complex policies both of Yugoslavia and of the US it was
                            not too surprising if some misunderstandings arose. It must be borne in
                            mind that the Yugoslav purpose above all is to maintain independence. At
                            the present time our two countries are engaged in putting their
                            relations on a realistic basis. This is a necessary development.</p>
                        <pb n="267" xml:id="pg_267" facs="0289"/>
                        <p>In reply to the President’s question about a realistic basis for
                            relations between Communist Yugoslavia and non-Communist United States,
                            the Minister said it was important not to exaggerate ideological
                            differences and not to use ideology to justify positions on
                            international issues. The President wondered in this connection what the
                            real differences, beneath the cloaking in ideology, were between the
                            four regimes—Soviet, Chinese Communist, Yugoslav and Albanian—and
                            whether the Minister considered nonideological factors more significant
                            than ideology in relations among these states. In explaining these
                            differences the Minister pointed to the differences in political
                            conception, in policy, in interests, in development and in economic
                            matters, especially as concerns the utilization of resources available
                            to the Bloc and more specifically the extension of aid from Bloc states
                            to China. He suggested therefore that ideology was an after effect of
                            those factors and that ideological difference was not as important as it
                            seemed.</p>
                        <p>The President asked why the Chinese Communists attacked Yugoslavia. The
                            Minister indicated it was no secret that there were bigger things behind
                            the Chinese attitude toward Yugoslavia, that is, the Soviet-Chinese
                            antagonism. As to the President’s question concerning what might be done
                            about Communist China, the Minister thought that the policy of the US
                            had served to push China into isolation and make for its militant
                            attitude. Referring to Communist China’s aggressive posture toward
                            India, the President wondered whether the approach of the Communist
                            Chinese would be much different if we had followed another policy.</p>
                        <p>The President turned to relations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union
                            with a question that if it is not ideological difference, what prevents
                            a close rapprochement between the two states. Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> said this had been impossible
                            because the Soviet Union had desired Yugoslavia to enter the Bloc in a
                            dependent relationship. He explained the closer relationship between
                            Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union existing today, a matter which the
                            President raised, as a result of Yugoslavia’s desire to have good
                            relations with all countries, the development over the years of a more
                            realistic attitude toward Yugoslavia on the part of Soviet leaders, a
                            Soviet willingness to take into account the independent status of
                            Yugoslavia and a change in the quality of relations generally between
                            the Soviet Union and other countries. He found the present improvement
                            in relationship due not to a change by Yugoslavia in the conception of
                            its position, but to a change in the Soviet view of its relation to
                            Yugoslavia. He asserted strongly that this did not mean Yugoslavia was
                            becoming an ally of the Soviets and he saw no reason for putting a
                            question this way. He did feel that there would be a steady improvement
                            in Yugoslav-Soviet relations if there was no basic change in
                            international relations generally.</p>
                        <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0290"/>
                        <p>The President commented that he was not attempting to pry into Yugoslav
                            affairs but he was interested in the association of our two countries.
                            From this standpoint he thought it desirable that as Yugo-slavia’s
                            relations developed with the Soviet Union its relations should also
                            develop with the US. Our problem of maintaining cordial relations with
                            Yugoslavia involves the element of public opinion. It must be clear to
                            our public that US policy toward Yugoslavia is in accord with our broad
                            policy objective of establishing a world of free and independent states.
                            It is to our interest if Yugoslavia becomes one of these states but does
                            not become a member of the Soviet Bloc. The President hoped consequently
                            that Yugoslavia was interested in improving its relations with the
                            US.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister replied that the Yugoslav people are the guarantee
                            of Yugoslavia’s independence. They are not prepared to lose independence
                            and they will pay again, as they have in the past, the cost of keeping
                            it. Yugoslavia would not want to have good relations with the Soviets at
                            the expense of bad relations with the US. The President noted that in
                            insuring its own independence Yugoslavia contributed to the maintenance
                            of Greek independence and the more independent position of Albania at
                            the present time.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked what the Minister saw Cuba becoming, a
                            Yugoslavia or a Communist China. The Minister referred to his
                            conversation at lunch with the Secretary of State<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d127fn1">No record of this conversation has been
                                found.</note> who he said had taken exception to the invitation to
                            Cuba to attend the Belgrade Conference because Cuba was not uncommitted.
                            The Minister had replied to the Secretary that they had tried through
                            such steps as this to encourage Cuba to move to a status of
                            nonalignment. When the President questioned why this had not happened,
                            the Minister answered that one of the reasons was that the US had closed
                            the door on Cuba too early. Its future now depends on the policies and
                            moves of the great powers.</p>
                        <p>Referring to differences from time to time between Yugoslavia and the US
                            in Africa, the President asked what kind of Africa does Yugoslavia
                            support. The Minister replied that Yugoslavia can go along far with the
                            US in its policy toward Africa. It desires to see an end of colonialism
                            there and supports moves in favor of independence, both political and
                            economic independence.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the US has no real history of a presence in
                            Africa and not an interest as in Latin America. The US therefore has
                            taken a clearly disinterested attitude toward African developments. In
                            the Congo we have supported the independence and unity of the country
                            and in this interest the government of Adoula, whereas Yugoslavia <pb
                                n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0291"/>supported Gizenga. The Minister
                            commented that Yugoslavia’s support was first for Lumumba and then for
                            Gizenga as the heir of Lumumba against Tshombe. Yugoslavia is for the
                            unity of the Congo. They took account of the realities of the situation
                            by inviting both Adoula and Gizenga to the Belgrade Conference and now
                            by having diplomatic representation at Leopoldville.</p>
                        <p>The President then put a question to Minister <persName corresp="#p_PK1"
                                >Popovic</persName> about ways of improving relations between the US
                            and Yugoslavia. The Minister said that he agreed with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_KGF1">Kennan</persName> on this subject.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KGF1">Kennan</persName> remarked that
                            he agreed with the Minister to a considerable extent but was concerned
                            about a possible tendency of Yugoslavia to take positions on
                            international issues on the basis of ideological principles and to
                            become in effect a political ally of the Soviet Union without being a
                            military ally. If we can feel that Yugoslavia judges us only on the
                            merits of issues we and other Americans will be relieved. The Minister
                            thought that any conclusion about the existence of such a tendency was
                            not correct and saw no danger in this regard. The US and Yugoslavia
                            differed in substance on a number of international issues and often
                            because of the US position in relation to allies on questions involving
                            colonialism. The US position on disarmament in the past was harder for
                            Yugoslavia to understand than the Soviet Union’s. Until recently the US,
                            for example, had not declared in a general statement its positive
                            attitude toward disarmament.</p>
                        <p>The President suggested the Minister look at our position on Angola in
                            the UN, which led to differences with Portugal; on the Congo, which
                            raised problems with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>; on West New
                            Guinea, which complicated our relations with the Netherlands; on Berlin,
                            which was against some elements in Europe; on the diffusion of nuclear
                            weapons, which was in conflict with the view of <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. How could Yugoslavia help
                            but object to East German developments if it followed principle as well
                            as reality in determining policy. We think our policy stands up very
                            well and should receive the sympathy of Yugoslavia if it takes positions
                            on principle. It would contribute to our aim of maintaining good
                            relations with Yugoslavia if it would show more sympathy or support for
                            our positions. This would count with public opinion here which is
                            influential in policy matters.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister indicated that Yugoslavia has no reason to present
                            American policy in bad colors. They agree with the US position when it
                            is also Yugoslavia’s but not to please the US. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM1">Nikezic</persName> commented that if Yugoslav
                            positions were examined by the other side the latter would find a number
                            of them unsatisfactory as was brought out in the statement of March 5 by
                            the Secretary of State (statement <pb n="270" xml:id="pg_270"
                                facs="0292"/>before the Kitchin Committee).<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d127fn2">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1"
                                    >Rusk</persName> made a taped statement on trade expansion on
                                March 5. The <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> Appointment
                                Books do not indicate any personal appearance before the House
                                Committee on Armed Services of which Representative <persName>Paul
                                    Kitchin</persName> (D.–NC) was chairman and which, at that time,
                                was preparing legislation modifying the Export Control Act.</note>
                            The Minister referred to a speech of his in the UN in 1958 which
                            satisfied neither side and which must therefore have been all right.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Nikezic</persName> said that if the
                            Yugoslavs had not been not only willing to seek independence but also
                            struggling to maintain it they would have been sucked up under foreign
                            control long since by reason of factors of geography, power, etc. This
                            attitude to preserve the independence of Yugoslavia is the will of the
                            Yugoslav people and not just of the <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName> Government. The will to preserve independence is
                            the essence of Yugoslav history and he thought they could be trusted to
                            go that way in the future.</p>
                        <p>The President said that our position in the world was thrust upon us and
                            considerable isolationist opinion, which was not sophisticated, still

                            important to take this into account. In connection with this background
                            we had our troubles in relations with Yugoslavia over the Belgrade

                            soft on communism took up the issue. We have had to carry our policy
                            toward Yugoslavia against these difficulties. If Yugoslavia takes
                            account of this and shows good will it will help to make it possible to
                            maintain and develop our relations with each other. The basis for
                            maintaining a friendly policy is the preservation by Yugoslavia of its
                            independent status. Anything Yugoslavia can do to manifest this status
                            makes it easier for us. The President asked whether the Minister would
                            carry this message home and he replied that he would of course.</p>
                        <p>The President wondered whether the Minister as a Communist has an
                            explanation of any new development in world affairs. The latter replied
                            that they did not believe that “we with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>” would bury you. They do think that a gradual
                            socialization is in process everywhere including the US which has some
                            degree of socialization already. They consider that socialism will
                            evolve in different ways in different countries and it is impossible to
                            have uniformity of development even if all countries were socialist.
                            This had been and is a basic issue with the Soviets.</p>

                        <p>In response to your request by telephone today we are submitting
                            additional information to you on the above subject.</p>
                        <p>Following the Belgrade Conference last September, and the uncertainties
                            which beset United States policy toward Yugoslavia in its aftermath,
                            there was a virtual suspension in the processing of military sales cases
                            for Yugoslavia. The processing of certain cases was long delayed; other
                            Yugoslav requests were rejected. On January 15 United States policy
                            toward Yugoslavia was reviewed by the National Security Council. Policy
                            decisions were made at that time regarding several facets of our policy
                            including that pertaining to military sales. The pertinent paragraph of
                            NSAM 123<note n="1" xml:id="d128fn1"><ref target="#d118">Document
                                    118</ref>.</note> provided that: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Continued military sales to Yugoslavia are approved to the
                                    extent they amount to no more than reasonable spare parts and
                                    supplies for existing equipment. It is not expected or desired
                                    that Yugoslav military personnel will receive training in the
                                    United States, and future Yugoslav applications for other new
                                    military purchases should be reviewed case by case.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>In the light of this policy decision there was a review of the backlog of
                            Yugoslav military sales cases in the Department of Defense. Yugoslav
                            requests which had not been previously refused were acted upon
                            favorably. The principal Yugoslav requests which were rejected were
                            sonar equipment, Bofors guns, and G-47 aircraft. The sonar equipment was
                            denied for “security considerations”. The other two items were no longer
                            available from excess United States stocks.</p>
                        <p>Following an approach by the Yugoslav Ambassador to the Secretary of
                            State inquiring about United States military sales policy toward
                            Yugoslavia, a meeting was arranged in early April with Yugoslav
                            officials in Washington. The Yugoslavs were informed that we anticipated
                            no difficulty in meeting Yugoslav requests for spare parts and supplies
                            for United States origin military equipment in Yugoslav hands. With
                            regard <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0294"/>to new items of
                            equipment, the Yugoslavs were urged to investigate the possibility of
                            procurement in Western Europe either from United States stocks there or
                            from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries. We promised in any
                            case to cooperate with them in working out the most feasible
                            arrangements. It was similarly suggested that training of Yugoslav
                            military personnel be considered first in Yugoslavia, secondly in
                            Western Europe, with the United States to be considered as the least
                            desirable possibility. The Yugoslav representatives were pleased by what
                            they considered to be a cooperative attitude on the part of United
                            States officials although they were not completely reassured that their
                            military equipment requirements could be met from the United States. The
                            Yugoslavs indicated particular concern about the denial of the sonar
                            equipment. They pointed out that on the basis of an offer they had
                            received from the United States Navy they deposited a check in payment
                            for the equipment and purchased helicopters in the United Kingdom on
                            which the sonar was to be used. After the Belgrade Conference, the Navy
                            offer was withdrawn for “security reasons” and the Yugoslavs were
                            informed that the equipment was no longer releasable to them.</p>
                        <p>There is another pending case involving a request of the United Kingdom
                            to release to Yugoslavia the Thunderbird rocket. The United States has
                            refused concurrence to such release on grounds that the rocket contains
                            classified United States technology. We have no indication that the
                            Yugoslavs are aware of our blocking of this proposed sale by the United
                            Kingdom but they will undoubtedly learn about it.</p>
                        <p>A meeting will be held on Tuesday, June 5, between the Departments of
                            State and Defense to reconsider the sonar and Thunderbird cases. An
                            effort will be made to evaluate the “security considerations” to
                            determine the extent to which classified information is embodied in
                            these equipments and if so whether release to Yugoslavia is nevertheless
                            appropriate.</p>
                        <p>The Department of Defense has concurred in this memorandum.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador said that he had requested this appointment on instruction
                            of his Government to obtain the Secretary’s evaluation of the situation
                            arising from the Senate’s action to deny further aid to Yugoslavia.<note

                                130</ref>.</note> As a result of the recent visit of Foreign
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName>, there was full
                            understanding in Belgrade that this action was contrary to the wishes of
                            the Administration. Moreover, Belgrade had been heartened by the prompt
                            and vigorous reaction of the Administration and important segments of
                            the US press. Nevertheless, the Ambassador said, there was great anxiety
                            in Yugoslavia. Denial of US aid, particularly at a time when the
                            Yugoslav economy was in serious difficulty would be a severe blow. The
                            amendment restoring PL 480 was, of course, very important but the
                            inability to obtain development loans would be very serious for
                            Yugoslavia’s investment program. Finally, the Ambassador said, the
                            Senate’s action on aid following upon the House action on <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> had created uncertainty about the
                            future direction of our relations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that he would wish to make the following comments: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The attitude of the Executive Branch was clearly reflected in
                                    the legislation it had presented to the Congress. This
                                    legislation did not, of course, contain restrictive
                                    provisions.</item>

                                    and Aid were contrary to the position of the Administration.
                                    Moreover the vote in support of the Lausche amendment was larger
                                    than what would be an accurate reflection of the true attitude
                                    of the Senate. A number of Senators switched their votes in
                                    favor when it was clear the amendment would pass. It should also
                                    be noted that some Senators were voting their anti-aid views
                                    rather than anti-Yugoslav or anti-Polish views per se.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>The Senate vote came as a surprise to the Administration. But
                                    the Administration immediately went to work to get a reversal of
                                    the <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0296"/>amendment to the
                                    extent possible. The result of the Administration’s effort so
                                    far was the Mansfield–Dirksen amendment restoring authority with
                                    respect to PL 480.</item>

                                    describe in some detail the complicated and delicate
                                    parliamentary situation at this stage of the legislative session

                                    would seek to limit the effects to the programs legally

                                    precluded, it would not affect our support for UN technical
                                    assistance. Nor would it affect our support for Yugoslavia in

                        <p>The Secretary concluded his remarks by stating that he did not wish to
                            mislead the Ambassador into over-optimism. He did, however, wish to
                            assure him of the Administration’s position.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador expressed appreciation for the Secretary’s comments and
                            indicated he would reassure Belgrade of the Administration’s intention
                            to work for improvement in the pending legislation and at any event to

                        <p>The House Ways and Means Committee, chaired by Wilbur Mills (D.–AK),
                            began consideration of the <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                                >Kennedy</persName> administration’s request for widened authority
                            to negotiate trade agreements in March 1962. On June 12, the Committee
                            reported legislation (H.R. 1818) that included a provision withdrawing
                            most-favored-nation (<gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>) status from
                            Poland and Yugoslavia. The bill passed the House on June 28 by a vote of
                            298 to 125.</p>
                        <p>The Senate Foreign Relations Committee took up the bill in July and held
                            4 weeks of hearings. The Department of State recalled Ambassador

                            made him available for discussions with members of Congress as part of

                            resulted in a bill that restored <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>
                            status, which the Senate passed on September 19 by a vote of 78 to

                            for reconciliation. During these negotiations, Representative Mills
                            insisted on retaining the <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> denial
                            provision, and the final conference report (H. Rpt. 2518) restored the
                            House language on <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>. This bill was
                            passed in the House by a vote of 256 to 91 on October 4 and in the
                            Senate on the same day by a voice vote. The legislation, the Trade
                            Expansion Act of 1962, instructed the President to suspend “as

                        <p>1692. Long discussion yesterday with Yugoslav official of senior rank
                            bears out and reinforces without exception every point made in my
                            previous messages. People here concerned with Yugoslav-US relations
                            felt, it was said, unable to explain to remainder Yugoslav officialdom
                            and to public why Yugoslavia should suddenly at this point be confronted
                            with measures of restrictive discrimination considerably more drastic
                            and unfriendly than those which prevailed under last administration at
                            time when US policy was ostensibly much less sympathetic to attempt of
                            neutrals to maintain independence between the two blocs. Yugoslavs,
                            while striving in coming period to improve commercial relations with
                            Russia and satellites (which represented only favorable openings still
                            available), proposed to do all in their power to maintain their
                            political independence vis-à-vis Moscow, whether our Congress had any
                            sympathy with that policy or not. But they were unable to understand why
                            people in Washington wanted to go out of their way to complicate this
                            task for them at present time or to see how this could be reconciled
                            with US interests. They feared, and had some evidence to support this,
                            that effect of various Congressional actions would be felt in Yugoslav
                            relations with other possible sources of Western economic <pb n="276"
                                xml:id="pg_276" facs="0298"/>and financial support. They were
                            obliged to view these actions, accordingly, as designed not just to
                            deprive them of aid from US and to damage their trade with US but to
                            create maximum difficulty in their economic relations with Western
                            countries generally. Fact that this was moment of great economic
                            distress here, when any unfriendly measure in this direction was bound
                            to be doubly painful, was no secret to anyone. It would be difficult to
                            persuade Yugoslav people that timing of these actions had not been
                            selected with deliberate view to exploiting their present plight and
                            creating maximum hardship for everyone concerned.</p>

                                Against Availability of Most-Favored-Nation Clause for Poland and
                                Yugoslavia</item>
                        </list>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Although we appear to be faced with a fait accompli, I
                                want to urge that a vigorous effort still be made no later than
                                Friday to get Wilbur Mills to reconsider the prohibition he has
                                insisted on in the trade bill against the availability of the
                                most-favored-nation clause for Poland and Yugoslavia.</hi></p>
                        <p>I recognize that Mills has already talked with the President and you on
                            this issue, and that the Conference Committee has made a decision. I
                            have also talked with him and realize his adamacy. However, the
                            conference report will not be submitted until very early next week, and
                            it is therefore at least theoretically still possible to get the
                            conference to reconsider the issue.</p>
                        <p>The information that I have obtained is that Mills was the principal, if
                            not only, major advocate in the Conference Committee for this
                            prohibition and the Senate Conferees held out against him for quite
                            awhile. In <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0299"/>both the Senate and
                            House strong sentiment exists, of course, against trade, aid, or
                            intercourse of any kind with the two communist countries. But Mills has
                            been the moving force for including this prohibition in the trade bill
                            in the Ways and Means Committee, then in the House, and now in the
                            Conference Committee. If he could be turned around, it would seem that
                            the whole situation might be reversed.</p>
                        <p>He has stated that the Conference Committee report on the trade bill
                            would be rejected on the House Floor without this prohibition. However,
                            I have talked with several key members, including the Speaker, and they
                            indicate a contrary opinion, although I doubt that they are anxious to
                            press this matter. Their opinion of the situation on the House Floor is
                            relevant, however, in that if Mills could be persuaded by the President,
                            the prospect of smooth sailing thereafter is in sight.</p>
                        <p>If the prohibition remains in the trade bill, it would seem only
                            realistic that a similar ban will have to be included in the aid bill.
                            The Congress can hardly be expected to approve giving away money and
                            food to the two communist countries if it has already declared we are
                            going to penalize trading and making a profit from them.</p>
                        <p>My principal reasons for seeking further consideration of this matter are
                            that (1) the issue was resolved quickly and quietly without orga-nizing
                            a vigorous stand on it, and (2) great substantive damage apparently will
                            be done to our economic offensive against the Communist Bloc in Eastern
                            Europe. If we do not fight for this issue, great damage will be done to
                            an international relationship and intrusion on Communist solidarity
                            accomplished over the period of the last decade. After the damage done
                            by the trade issue, we must face further injury in the aid ban that
                            would likely follow, and then in a possible effort later to intercept
                            their trading with Cuba. In this series of events we are giving in to
                            Mills on the point on which it would be easiest to take a defensible
                            stand.</p>
                        <p>All of this damage is occurring, of course, just at the moment that the
                            Soviets are trying to win them back—and just at a time when the
                            Yugoslavs have shown through their new constitution that they want to
                            expand Western concepts of individual initiative. Our default at this
                            juncture would appear to be difficult to rationalize in later periods
                            tactically as well as strategically.</p>
                        <p>If the present problem cannot be resolved on its merits, as I would hope,
                            I would think that the Administration would at least want to make a
                            strong public record of having sought to continue trade with the two
                            countries and place elsewhere the responsibility for any events in the
                            coming year which clearly demonstrate that Yugoslavia is turning back
                            towards the Soviet Union. Surely this Administration would not want to
                            be left open to a later charge that such progress as the previous one
                            had made exploiting the loosening of the Poles and Yugoslavs from the
                                <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0300"/>Communist Bloc had been
                            defaulted without major effort. I believe that at the very least a good
                            strong record needs to be made before anyone charges we have let these

                                    confronted by congressional gestures designed apparently only to
                                    express hostility to Yugo, behavior of this government would
                                    move increasingly beyond range of our influence or power of
                                    prediction and that in this case I would have to disclaim all
                                    responsibility for turns Yugo policy might take. Action which
                                    has now been taken with respect to <gloss target="#t_MFN1"

                                    I then had in mind. It would be quixotic for us to expect, in
                                    light of this action, that either this mission or indeed our
                                    government as a whole will be able to exert significant
                                    political influence on Yugo in coming period and so long as this

                                    />treatment of Yugo trade prevails. Responsibility for whatever
                                    this means in terms of Yugo’s world position and her relations
                                    with Soviet Union must lie squarely with congressional figures
                                    who have insisted on this action face of contrary advice from
                                    every qualified quarter. Up to moment of approval of this
                                    provision by House–Senate conferees last week, nothing had
                                    occurred to change basically independent position Yugo had taken
                                    in recent years, a position which has probably had greater
                                    effect than any other single factor in promoting polycentrism
                                    within Soviet bloc and reducing its power to act as an effective
                                    unit in world affairs. US policy under three administrations,
                                    now effectively repudiated, had importantly contributed to this
                                    situation. I can make no estimates or predictions as to what
                                    will occur in future. If previous position and role of Yugo, so
                                    favorable to our interests, are preserved, this will be despite,
                                    not because of, what we have recently done.</item>

                        <p>The Secretary said he would like to talk about our bilateral relations,
                            since these are in a state of what he hoped would be temporary
                            complication. First, he wanted to discuss the trade question. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> is trying hard to
                            prevent Congress from taking action with respect to the
                            most-favored-nation clause. We still did not know what the final result
                            would be but at no time has there been any question of the view of the
                            Executive Branch. The Secretary said he had met at least eight times
                            with Congressional committees to explain to them the importance of
                            keeping our relations with Yugoslavia on a normal basis. He urged upon
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> the importance of
                            neither the Yugoslavs’ nor our reacting too quickly. We on our side
                            should take time to look at what possibilities there are, then we both
                            should sit down and talk over actual trade problems and possibilities.
                            He realized it would not be easy for the Yugoslavs in view of the
                            political atmosphere resulting from Congressional action. He said that
                            on the practical side he was not discouraged about the
                            possibilities.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, he said he wanted to talk about the <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                                >EEC</gloss> aspects. The powers granted to the President under the
                            Trade Bill will let us negotiate vigorously for a common reduction of
                            external tariffs. It is in our interest to do what we can to prevent the
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> from becoming a small, closed
                            trading community rather than a broad, open one. We hope that what
                            Yugoslavia can do by its trade with Western Europe and what we can do
                            because of our Trade Bill will help ensure this. The Secretary said he
                            would like to hear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName>’s
                            views.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> said he wondered what
                            possibilities the Secretary saw in our bilateral trade relations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we would have to wait to see what flexibility Congress
                            will permit. For example (and this was speculation rather than a
                            promise) the treaty of 1881<note n="1" xml:id="d134fn1">For text of the

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> said the Yugoslav
                            people and Government very much want good relations between our two
                            countries and this will not change. Nevertheless, the trade question
                            does concern Yugoslavia greatly. He realized the U.S. Government has
                            made efforts with Congress. He would like, however, to suggest
                            additional arguments that might be of use. <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >MFN</gloss> is a mutual obligation embodied in a bilateral treaty,
                            signed long ago, providing a one-year period for denunciation. Secondly,
                            Congressional action came at a particularly unfavorable moment during
                            the <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> visit. The Secretary
                            interjected that we had already used these arguments. Moreover,
                                <persName corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> continued,
                            Congressional action would affect Yugoslav relations not only with the
                            U.S. but also with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> countries.
                            Next year obligations fall due on loans Yugoslavia has received in order
                            to liberalize its economy. The question will be how to meet these
                            obligations. Generally, one can say there is no doubt that Congressional
                            action will affect our political relations. This is neither in Yugoslav
                            nor U.S. interest. The U.S. press calls Yugoslavia Communist but, at the
                            same time, the U.S. recognizes Yugoslavia as non-aligned. Yugoslavia is
                            very active in this way in a positive manner. For example, Ambassador
                            Klutznick mentioned the Cairo Conference very favorably yesterday.
                            Yugoslavia sees more such possibilities. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PK1"
                                >Popovic</persName> hoped Congress realized this. He suggested there
                            were some things the U.S. Government can do. He has talked to some of
                            his commercial people and they reported that the Americans with whom
                            they deal are now stopping negotiations on the grounds they don’t know
                            what will happen. The U.S. Government might, therefore, make a statement
                            which would help in this respect.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that on the basis of the final Congressional action we
                            will examine the possibilities as quickly as possible. He did not think
                            this would take very long. He said that to some extent our bilateral
                            relations are caught in a crossfire of matters for which Yugoslavia is
                            not responsible and over which Yugoslavia has little control. The Soviet
                            pressures in Berlin are a prime example. We have not been able to assure
                                <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0304"/>our people that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is willing to settle the
                            Berlin question peacefully. The Berlin question should not make any
                            difference in our relations with a non-aligned country but the fact is
                            it does. Another factor is the unnecessary and inflammatory buildup of
                            military equipment in Cuba. In this atmosphere a non-aligned but Marxist
                            nation comes under criticism. This general atmosphere is not related to
                            the Yugoslav problem but Yugoslavia is caught up in it. The Secretary
                            pointed out there was also a domestic factor. He said that, whereas most
                            of the Polish nationality groups in the U.S. have supported the concept
                            of increased trade with Poland even though they did not favor the
                            existing Polish Government, the Yugoslav nationality groups here
                            generally have not, and have been unhelpful with Congress.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> said that the Yugoslavs
                            support the U.S. attitude for a peaceful settlement of the Berlin and
                            German question and recognize the efforts the U.S. Government has made
                            to this end. These efforts make it easier for Yugoslavia to use what
                            influence it has with the other side not to take a rigid position; that
                            is, the more the U.S. shows willingness for a peaceful settlement, the
                            more Yugoslavia can do to help. He commented, however, that the Federal
                            Republic shows no willingness to normalize its relations with Yugoslavia
                            and this affects Yugoslav public opinion. As for Cuba, Yugoslavia would,
                            of course, like to see it non-aligned. Yugoslavia is not on very good
                            terms with Cuba. On the other hand, self-determination and
                            non-interference are basic principles in Yugoslav policy and Yugoslavia
                            still thinks there is a possibility for the U.S. to settle the question
                            peacefully. As for the Yugoslav immigrants in the U.S., there are two
                            groups, one of which does support good relations. There is a large Croat
                            organization which does and he thought the Slovenes did too. In fact,
                            the great majority of Yugoslavs here want good relations but perhaps
                            they are not active enough. He was certain that the political immigrants
                            are more active, and sometimes misinform U.S. politicians. Turning to
                            our action with respect to shipping, he said that he thought that
                            technically we could avoid problems as far as the Yugoslavs were
                            concerned. On principle, however, he felt the action was not correct,
                            involving as it did third countries. Yugoslavia ships no military cargo
                            to Cuba. This affects only Russia.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we are not imposing a blockade. As for a settlement,
                            the Cuban problem does not involve ourselves alone but other countries
                            in the Hemisphere as well. There are only two points that are not
                            negotiable. The first is the military and political connection with
                            Moscow. The second is Cuban interference in other countries of the
                            Hemisphere with agents and funds. This is active interference. As to
                            Germany, the Secretary said that he could understand why Yugoslavia
                            might not want to see Germany reunified now. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> interjected that what worried
                            them was re-militarization, not reunification. The <pb n="283"
                                xml:id="pg_283" facs="0305"/>Secretary continued that we may not
                            agree with the Yugoslav position but we could understand it. We think,
                            however, that it would be a mistake to close the door to reunification.
                            Nationalism being what it is, the prospect of permanent separation may
                            bring the wrong Germans to the top in both parts of Germany. As for
                            militarization, he said, our memories are short. The Soviets armed the
                            East Germans for one year under repeated Western protests before the
                            Federal Republic started to arm. The all-German problem, however, is
                            separable from the Berlin problem. Our commitments are such, and our
                            agreements with the Soviet Union are such, that we cannot and will not
                            agree to turn over two and a quarter million Berliners to the East
                            Germans. If this fact is understood as a basic point, all other
                            questions can be handled. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>, however, talks only about West Berlin,
                            saying that East Berlin and East Germany have already been settled and
                            are no longer under discussion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> said he thought there
                            were possibilities for solving the Berlin question peacefully. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> and he had stressed the
                            need for the Big Two to negotiate. Not only the Russians, but others in
                            the bloc as well, want to settle the question. He did not, however, see
                            any willingness here to make efforts toward a settlement before our
                            elections.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that our elections have nothing to do with it. No U.S.
                            President could give up West Berlin, elections or no elections.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> said he did not think
                            anyone was asking for that. He was sure the Soviets are not very much
                            interested in the Cuban question now; they are concentrating on settling
                            Berlin.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we are talking in circles with the Soviets on this.
                            First they say they want to bring World War Two to an end. We say all
                            right, let’s discuss how to do this—self-determination, etc. Then they
                            say look at the fact, there are two Germanies. We say there is a third
                            fact—Berlin. They say they want to change that fact, so we are back to
                            the question of putting an end to World War Two. Given this circle, we
                            have tried to convince them that the problem is now to accept the fact
                            of disagreement. How then do we manage this fact of disagreement without
                            war and how do we work out a modus vivendi. Up to now, the Soviets have
                            shown no interest in this.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> said that if we could
                            agree on (1) demilitarization of Germany and (2) guaranteeing the
                            frontiers, then the Berlin problem would disappear.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we have had some experience with demobilization. Our
                            military budget in 1947 was 10 billion dollars; it is now about 50
                            billion dollars. The graph of the increase coincides with pressures on
                            Greece, Turkey, Korea, Berlin, etc. If we take ten billion dollars as
                            our normal peacetime military budget, then we have spent, since 1947,
                            420 billion dollars above normal because of Soviet pressures in addition
                            to <pb n="284" xml:id="pg_284" facs="0306"/>the lives lost in Korea. We
                            have seen nothing in our experience since 1945 which gives us any
                            confidence in demilitarization as a solution. He said he did not expect
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> to comment on this but
                            he wanted to say that, given the situation in Central Europe, the
                            presence of U.S. forces in Berlin and West Germany is a stabilizing
                            element.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> said he could agree to
                            this if we made efforts to settle the Berlin question.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he wondered why the Soviets did not destalinize East
                            Germany. If the regime were more accepted by the people there would be
                            fewer tensions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> commented that he was
                            not sure. The East Germans do recognize their frontiers, they have
                            negotiated a trade agreement with Yugoslavia and in general the
                            Yugoslavs have found them easy to deal with. He repeated that he thought
                            it was possible to reach a peaceful settlement. The Secretary replied
                            that we do not say it is impossible; he just did not see any
                            possibilities now. He asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PK1"
                                >Popovic</persName> how long he intended to stay in the U.S. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> replied he would be
                            here about two weeks. The Secretary said that before Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> left, we should have something
                            more precise to say about the trade problem. There is some prospect that
                            statements will be made on the floor of Congress which will ease the
                            problem as far as the legislative history and Congressional intent are
                            established.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> asked if the Government
                            could make a statement.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied he felt sure the President’s efforts with
                            Congressional leaders were more important at this juncture than any
                            statement that could be made. He urged Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PK1"
                                >Popovic</persName> not to be prematurely discouraged.</p>

                            attaches to strong statement by President at time signing of Trade
                            Expansion Act indication administration’s dislike of Congressional

                            Yugoslavia. This was central point that emerged from general discussion

                            Act and appropriations bill.</p>
                        <p>While noting with interest press reports on final provisions
                            appropriations bill, Petric focused his attention on <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>. He recalled hope expressed by Foreign
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> in Washington
                            that aid would not be needed much longer. But without <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> future US/Yugoslav economic relations
                            plainly insecure. PL 480 would not alone provide secure basis. Trade was
                            foundation of sound economic relations and it was denial of <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> treatment under the Trade Expansion Act
                            that was of immediate and deep concern to his government. He then went
                            on to make following principal points: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>This government could not understand our handling Yugoslavia
                                    legislatively as if it were member of Warsaw Pact. While he did
                                    not make point explicitly he implied that coupling of Poland and
                                    Yugoslavia showed lack of understanding of fundamentally
                                    different position these two governments bear to Soviet Bloc. He
                                    posed rhetorical question several times, “do you want to push us
                                    into the Bloc?” There was, he asserted, a basic misconception in
                                    US of Yugoslavia’s independent posture and of its relations with
                                    Soviet Bloc.</item>

                                <item>His Foreign Minister had been led to believe in Washington, as
                                    had Yugoslav Embassy there, that <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                        >MFN</gloss> provision was under control and that it would
                                    be deleted in final stages of legislation. It came as great
                                    surprise to find things turning out otherwise. We pointed inter
                                    alia to situation that had developed with respect to Cuba, the
                                    strong feelings within our country on this issue, and how it
                                    added to the administration’s legislative difficulties. In
                                    noting this Petric said his government had been quite correct on
                                    Cuban problem. Noting in passing but without elaboration that
                                    his government was unhappy over Barin Drzic case, he said
                                    Yugoslav carriers had standing orders not to transport anything
                                    of dubious character to Cuba and that he had specific knowledge
                                    of <pb n="286" xml:id="pg_286" facs="0308"/>cases where Yugoslav
                                    carriers had declined to carry such material although sought to
                                    do so by Western shippers. His government, he concluded, would
                                    be sensitive on problems of free trade and free navigation with
                                    Cuba.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>While no action had been taken on matter yet, entire <gloss
                                        target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> subject was under active review
                                    by his government. At the moment it was waiting to see if the
                                    President would make strong statement at time of signing Trade
                                    Expansion Act making it clear administration saw differently
                                    from Congress on Yugoslav problem and denial of <gloss
                                        target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> privileges. His government
                                    needed such public statement so that its own people could
                                    understand there is basic difference of view in US on this
                                    matter so crucial to Yugoslavia. Petric noted with satisfaction
                                    recent articles by <persName>Walter Lippmann</persName> and
                                        <persName>Chalmers Roberts</persName> as well as editorials
                                    that have appeared in the US press. But what was needed was
                                    short of Presidential statement that he described. To this he
                                    clearly attached the utmost importance. He reverted back to it
                                    repeatedly. When we expressed surprise that there should be any
                                    doubt in anyone’s mind on where administration stood on this
                                    issue, Petric said record was clear until about two weeks ago
                                    when first real trouble was encountered with <gloss
                                        target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> clause during final stages of
                                    negotiation. Since then the administration had made no clear-cut
                                    public statement that was helpful to Yugoslav Government. In
                                    looking to future, we recalled to Petric some of points made by
                                    Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> to Valdimir
                                        <persName corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> recently as
                                    measure of desire to deal with <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                        >MFN</gloss> problem promptly and constructively. We noted
                                    that in any event it presumably would be twelve months after
                                    notification before tariff rates would actually change and the
                                    interval afforded both of us opportunity to deal with problem
                                    constructively. Petric quickly pointed out that effective date
                                    of rate changes was less important than present psychological
                                    impact. In anticipation of abrogation of <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                        >MFN</gloss> treaty, commercial and trading circles would
                                    now be more diffident about doing business with Yugoslavia and
                                    her credit position was likely to be adversely affected.
                                    Moreover, voice of US Government would now carry less weight
                                    with Western European circles in those forums such as <gloss
                                        target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                                        >EEC</gloss> where US had been helpful on Yugo-slavia’s
                                    behalf in past. Western Europeans could point to our own actions
                                    and call into question whatever influence we might now try to
                                    exert. Meeting concluded with Petric’s observing that
                                    appropriate public statement by administration was essential
                                    first step to any constructive action on problem and that in
                                    absence such statement his government could only assume
                                    Congressional action represented administration as well as
                                    Congressional attitude toward Yugoslavia.</item>

                                    will be very bad. Only strong statement by President at this

                                    avail in countering this impression, and much less press
                                    reaction. A Presidential statement at later date might on

                            was that President had strong paragraph prepared and then found that

                            of large Congressional group including Wilbur Mills who was at once
                            indispensable in passage of bill and determined and sincere opponent of

                            faced choice between softening language to point of ineffectiveness out
                            of personal friendship to Mills, or else risking press assertions of
                            personal affront to Congressman who is powerful on all issues and
                            helpful on many. This led him to omit the paragraph, and to issue it
                            separately has not proved practicable, as President initially intended,
                            because he is out campaigning.</p>

                            question with you, you should make it clear that you know directly from
                            the President of his continued determination to press for removal of
                                <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> prohibition in next session and
                            your understanding from White House that his position will be made clear
                            at earliest moment appropriate in terms of political effectiveness in
                            US. Our expectation is that this will be at next press conference, but
                            you might emphasize to Yugoslavs that President’s determination is the
                            essential point and that even from their own point of view political
                            effectiveness within the US is more important element in timing of
                            statements than understandable need for reassurance in Belgrade.</p>

                                768.13/10–1262)</note> His purpose was to express <gloss

                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> to Yugoslavia by new trade act. His
                            statement was more restrained and measured in tone than editorials of
                            morning press but not less disturbing in content. Following is summary
                            his remarks.</p>
                        <p>He could well believe administration had not wished to see this action
                            taken. But action had been taken; it was there. Yugoslavs could not be
                            asked to base their reactions on subtle distinctions between various
                            branches of our government. So far as they were concerned this was
                            action of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and had to be treated as
                            such.</p>
                        <p>During recent period, as he thought I would agree, they had shown great
                            restraint and had avoided any action that could possibly exacerbate
                            developing situation in Washington (I agreed). There was now no further
                            point in remaining silent.</p>
                        <p>They could see only two calculations on basis of which this action could
                            have been justified in minds of its authors: (A) That Yugoslavs were in
                            so miserable position that this could be done to them with impunity, or
                            (B) that they were not ever really independent at all. Both had
                            profoundly offensive connotations. In their view this was a political
                            action taken for purely political reasons. It was no comfort to them to
                            know that at their expense certain other things might have happened
                            which had positive significance.</p>
                        <p>For all of this and its consequences they were not only disappointed but
                            profoundly concerned. It was idle to suppose that effects of this action
                            were limited to the prospective rises in duties, that they would not be
                            felt until the duties were changed, or that they would be limited to
                            this immediate injury. Already, things were happening on every hand,
                            injurious to Yugoslavia which were reflections of congressional action.
                            In matters of their relationship to <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                >GATT</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, in
                            international financial matters, et cetera, they were already
                            encountering difficulties traceable directly to this cause. A chain
                            reaction had set in. He gave me examples: A 5,000 ton order for soybeans
                            from the US which could not be fulfilled; reluctance of EXIM Bank to
                            pursue discussions with their <pb n="289" xml:id="pg_289" facs="0311"
                            />representatives; cancellation in New York, for avowed political
                            reasons, of large order for Slovenian furniture, et cetera. Even in best
                            of circumstances there was setting in a negative inertia from which
                            Yugoslav interests were bound to suffer widely.</p>
                        <p>Yugoslavs were simply flabbergasted to receive such an injury from us at
                            this time. They were obliged to think back to years immediately after
                            the war. There had been extremely unpleasant moments in our relationship
                            then and even instances where they had seen themselves obliged to fire
                            on our planes. Yet even at that time nothing of this nature had ever
                            been undertaken against them. He realized statements had been made from
                            time to time which annoyed us, but no such overt action, designed to
                            injure us, had been taken on their side. We could understand their
                            bewilderment and consternation at being faced with such action
                            today.</p>
                        <p>They felt there was nothing more they could hold onto in US-Yugoslav
                            relations. He had been obliged to report to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> that he was unable to assure him of
                            stability of our arrangements for surplus food. He could never tell now
                            when something would come up that would vitiate this entire program. He
                            had been obliged to advise the President to look around for
                            alternatives, as matter of common prudence.</p>
                        <p>This situation had already damaged our relations. He saw no possibility
                            of returning to normal basis so long as the action remained in force.
                            Even if it were repaired at early date it would be some time before all
                            the damage, material and psychological, could be repaired. In some
                            respects, repair might never be wholly possible for time would be
                            marching on and even when reversal came, conditions might no longer be
                            what they once were. On other hand, if no correction of this situation
                            could be made, and if it were to continue indefinitely, he wanted me to
                            understand that all the positions of our government in this country
                            would then be seriously jeopardized.</p>
                        <p>I said I would report his statement to my government promptly and in
                            detail. Observed I had as yet seen nothing that led me to believe that
                            PL 480 shipments were jeopardized. Said I was persuaded administration
                            intended to try to bring about a reversal of action on <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> when new Congress met and I thought it
                            possible this would be made clear publicly in coming period. Pointed out
                            that while no one expected this action would go wholly without reaction
                            from Yugoslav side, they would doubtless have many occasions to choose
                            whether to conduct themselves in manner that would facilitate reversal
                            Congress decision or in manner that would further exacerbate
                            congressional opinion, and voiced conviction former would be in their
                            own interests.</p>
                        <p>My own analysis is that <persName corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName>’s
                            remarks were accurate statement of Foreign Office position but did not
                            fully reflect extent of hurt pride <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290"
                                facs="0312"/>and anger now prevailing on part of senior leaders,
                            effects of which we may be made to feel at any time. Statement suggests
                            no decision yet taken to retaliate sharply against our “positions” in
                            Yugoslavia, which I take to mean libraries, cultural exchange
                            arrangements, <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> mission, Consulates,
                            but such decision would have to be expected if PL480 were to be
                            terminated or drastically curtailed in present circumstances.</p>
                        <p>(To me personally, <persName corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> was
                            cordial and pleasant throughout. He insisted on producing refreshments,
                            which is Yugoslav way of stressing that unpleasant statements are not to
                            be taken personally.)</p>

                        <p>During his call on the Secretary on October 23 Yugoslav Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MV2">Veljko Micunovic</persName> brought the
                            conversation around to US-Yugoslav relations which he said he was under
                            instructions from the Foreign Office to discuss. He spoke along the
                            following lines: He wished to underline Yugoslavia’s sense of
                            bewilderment and consternation at Congressional action denying Most
                            Favored Nation treatment to Yugoslavia. It is useless to go into all of
                            the reasons why Yugoslavia feels this way because these are well
                            understood in the State Department. Yugo-slavia’s principal concern was
                            that a new element had been inserted into otherwise very profitable
                            US-Yugoslav relations. There was a clear understanding in Belgrade of
                            the attitude of the <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                            Administration <pb n="291" xml:id="pg_291" facs="0313"/>towards the
                            Congressional action and it was recognized that the Administration had
                            striven manfully to prevent what turned out to be the final result.
                            Great political damage had been done to Yugoslavia’s international
                            reputation and prestige. The Yugoslav Government was most upset over
                            this fact and regarded itself as totally blameless in the result-ant
                            deterioration in US-Yugoslav relations. The Yugoslav Government hopes
                            for normalization of relations and trusts that the Administration will
                            take some steps to rectify a situation which, from the Yugoslav
                            standpoint, is unwarranted. Yugoslavia sets great store by its relations
                            with the United States and would like to see these relations expand to
                            the profit of both parties. Yugoslavia continues to value highly
                            friendly relations with the United States and is just as determined as
                            ever to maintain an independent policy in international affairs. Feeling
                            was extremely high in Yugoslavia because of the recent Congressional
                            action, particularly since the timing was so bad. Yugoslavia’s foreign
                            economic relations are being expanded in the direction of Western Europe
                            and the United States and away from the Soviet Bloc. The Congressional
                            action was clearly against this trend and Yugoslav efforts to associate
                            itself more closely with <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, <gloss
                                target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>, and the Common Market countries.
                            Three years of bad harvest and “certain other difficulties” had made the
                            impact of the action by Congress much greater.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that as he had said to Valdimir <persName
                                corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> in New York a short time ago
                            both the President and he regretted exceedingly the action of the
                            Congress denying <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> treatment to
                            Yugoslavia. The Ambassador was quite correct in his statement that the
                            Administration had made strenuous efforts to prevent the Congressional
                            action. He went on to say that we would be in no hurry to implement the
                            provisions of the new law and that certain steps were under
                            consideration to correct the situation. He said that we are working on
                            the problem and that we would do our utmost to prevent serious trade
                            complications for Yugoslavia. We also would make an effort to see to it
                            that a positive attitude was adopted toward Yugoslavia’s request for
                            provisional accession to <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MV2">Micunovic</persName> thanked the
                            Secretary for his statement of the US attitude and said he would inform
                            Belgrade immediately. He repeated that Yugoslavia seeks a return to
                            normal relations with the US as soon as possible since it values these
                            relations highly. He intimated that it would be possible to restore
                            these relations to normalcy only if <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>
                            status were restored to Yugoslavia. The Secretary said he understood and
                            observed that Yugoslavia had been caught in the whirlwind of reaction to
                            recent developments involving Soviet actions in Cuba. Yugoslavia could
                            not prevent what happened; neither he nor the President could prevent it
                            either. Yugoslavia had no connection with developments in Cuba but as
                            long as tension stemming from Soviet actions in <pb n="292"

                            were going to be problems for Yugoslavia in the United States.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MV2">Micunovic</persName> replied that
                            Yugo-slavia’s only interest at the moment was to see a relaxation in the
                            presently very taut international situation.</p>
                        <p>In the process of bidding the Secretary farewell Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MV2">Micunovic</persName> mentioned the long delay in
                            presenting his credentials to the President. He said he hoped to do this
                            as soon as possible and expressed the hope that the present crisis over
                            Cuba would not unduly delay the presentation of his credentials. The
                            Secretary replied that the President was extremely occupied at the
                            moment but that we would do what we could to arrange his call on the
                            President as soon as possible.<note n="1" xml:id="d139fn1"><persName

                                <item>to encourage evolution of the institutions and practices of
                                    the present Yugoslav regime away from the Soviet pattern on the
                                    basis of which they were originally founded and in the direction
                                    of greater liberality and greater affinity to those of the
                                    West.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The original rationale for such a policy was clear and persuasive. Up to
                            1948, a monolithic unity had existed in the Communist movement. The
                            thesis had been well-established in communist circles and beyond that
                            without this unity there could be no successful adherence to
                            Marxist-Leninist principles. This thesis was useful to Stalin and his
                            followers. It contributed importantly to the discipline of their
                            movement. It left millions of sincere Marxists with the feeling that
                            there was no real alternative between the total abandonment of their
                            cause or complete submission to Moscow. By 1948, this impression,
                            closely connected as it was with the myth of the Kremlin’s
                            infallibility, had come in fact to constitute an essential part of the
                            magic of the appeal of the communist movement to millions of people.</p>
                        <p>The Yugoslav defection shattered this magic. For this reason, it was
                            obviously important to the West that <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName> should succeed in his effort to establish an
                            independent position. Whether he could do this would of course depend
                            largely on whether Yugoslavia proved capable of surviving and
                            flourishing economically outside the Soviet system. The achievement of a
                            reasonable degree of economic prosperity was almost essential to the
                            establishment and maintenance of independence.</p>
                        <p>But more than this was at stake in Yugoslavia’s economic future. If
                            Yugoslavia, as a nominally Marxist-socialist state operating outside the
                            framework of the Soviet system, were to show better results in the way
                            of economic development than did those of the Eastern European
                            satellites which remained <hi rend="italic">within</hi> the system, this
                            would be bound to excite jealousy and a demand for greater independence
                            of policy vis-à-vis Moscow among the peoples and regimes of the
                            remainder of the erstwhile satellite area. To the extent this economic
                            success could be associated with, and supported by, Western practices,
                            or at least ones differing from those of Moscow, Yugoslavia would
                            provide an example which could only serve, in the long run, to shake
                            confidence, throughout the communist orbit and among the non-committed
                            peoples, in the infallibility of the Kremlin and the correctness of its
                            ideas and approaches.</p>
                        <p>There was, therefore, every reason for the U.S. to adopt, as it did, a
                            policy aimed at the strengthening of Yugoslavia’s independence, at the
                            support of her economic advance, and at the evolution of her
                            institutions and practices away from the Moscow patterns.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">2. What U.S. policy has not
                            been.</hi></p>
                        <p>At the time this policy was devised, American policymakers knew well that
                                <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> was himself an old-school
                            Marxist-Leninist communist, <pb n="294" xml:id="pg_294" facs="0316"/>and
                            that as such he was not, and was not likely to become, our friend.
                            Nevertheless, the policy then adopted ruled out any effort to overthrow
                            him. For this, there were good reasons.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>First, even had it been feasible for us to promote <persName
                                    corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s overthrow, it would have been
                                a dreadful political mistake. It would have served as clear evidence
                                to other satellite leaders that survival was possible for them only
                                in complete submission to Moscow—that any attempt to follow
                                    <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s example would only
                                leave them vulnerable to destruction at the hands of embittered and
                                implacable capitalists. It would, in this way, have sacrificed at
                                the outset one of the main advantages the Western world might hope
                                to derive from the Soviet-Yugoslav break, namely: the introduction
                                into the minds of the satellite communist leaders of the element of
                                doubt as to whether slavish adherence to Moscow discipline and
                                example was the only feasible political course open to them.</item>
                            <item>Secondly, to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>
                                was unnecessary. It was clear that a Yugoslav socialist regime which
                                had sacrificed the tie with Moscow and had struck out on the
                                perilous and difficult path of trying to find a satisfactory
                                independent existence somewhere between the two worlds would have no
                                stomach for further efforts at subversion in the U.S. and other
                                Western countries. To pursue such efforts in association with Moscow
                                was now no longer possible; to pursue them alone would have been
                                quixotic. The U.S. had nothing to fear then, and has had nothing to
                                fear since, from the standpoint of its internal security, from an
                                independent socialist Yugoslavia.</item>
                            <item>Finally, to overthrow the Yugoslav regime was simply not
                                politically feasible. There was no visible alternative to it that
                                would have been preferable. The “partisan” movement, with <persName
                                    corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> at its head, represented the
                                only serious unifying force in the country. Without it, at any time
                                in the postwar period, the country would have fallen to pieces. The
                                major non-socialist political parties which had opposed the
                                communists in the wartime period were ones expressing the political
                                will, in each case, of only one of the national components of the
                                Yugoslav state—primarily the Croats or the Serbs. The most active
                                political force among the Croats was outspokenly fascist in
                                inspiration and was wholly aligned with the Nazi cause during the
                                war. The Serbian monarchists had deeply estranged the other
                                nationalities in the prewar period; it is out of the question that
                                they should have constituted the basis for a restoration of the
                                Yugoslav state after the war, even had Mikhailovic retained Allied
                                support and won out over the partisans.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The painful fact is that in the postwar period the <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> regime was Yugoslavia, and it still
                            is. There have been varying phases and forms of popular discontent with
                            it—some quite widespread. But there has been no serious
                            national-Yugoslav opposition, as opposed to separatist opposition <pb
                                n="295" xml:id="pg_295" facs="0317"/>or opposition expressing the
                            aspirations only of one or the other of the national components of the
                            present state. Whoever talks about overthrowing the present regime talks
                            in reality about breaking up the Yugoslav state. The appalling
                            instability this would at once introduce into Balkan affairs is obvious.
                            Nothing could be less realistic than to suppose that a number of
                            fragment-entities, none of them prepared for independence and some of
                            them not even potentially qualified for it, could provide a more
                            effective resistance to Soviet communism in the Balkan area than the
                            extraordinarily firm and experienced national regime that now governs
                            twenty million people in this area and controls one of the two largest

                        <p>The results of this policy, as of the beginning of 1961, were generally
                            favorable and encouraging. Extensive changes, all in Western interests,
                            had by that time taken place in Yugoslav institutions and practices.
                            Economic life had been extensively reoriented towards the West. Foreign
                                <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0318"/>trade now ran predominantly
                            to Western countries. With respect to contacts with foreigners, travel
                            by Yugoslavs abroad, access to foreign media of information, and
                            cultural and intellectual exchanges with Western countries, a regime was
                            being applied which was far more lenient than that of any of the
                            countries remaining within the bloc. Extensive changes in the direction
                            of greater liberalization had occurred in both the social and the
                            political system. Tastes and interests of the people were now running
                            overwhelmingly to the West. It is not an exaggeration to say that by
                            1961 Yugoslavia had come more than half the distance from Soviet
                            outlooks, institutions and practices to ones which, while not identical
                            with those of the West, were such as to permit a generally normal,
                            profitable, and cordial relationship with Western countries. And the
                            trend was continuing. Not all of this was the effect of our effort
                            alone; but without our effort it would assuredly not have occurred.</p>
                        <p>The success was not uniform or complete. We were not successful in
                            changing the political personality of the Yugoslav President himself.
                            Nothing that we did served to produce any great change in <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s view of himself as a communist;
                            in his concern for the opinions of other communist leaders; in his
                            determination—as a supreme political goal—to win respect and acceptance
                            from the communist world by which he had been rejected. His views on
                            world problems continued to be colored by ideological prejudice. He
                            could be brought to like individual Americans, but not America as such.
                            He persisted in viewing American aid cynically and without gratitude, as
                            something extended for selfish imperialistic reasons which placed no
                            claim on his appreciation. He avoided, where he could, being put in the
                            position of asking for our aid or expressing public appreciation for it;
                            he did his best to avoid bringing to public attention its nature and its
                            extent. Under his personal influence, Yugoslav attitudes towards the
                            broader cold war issues continued to show a partiality to the communist
                            side (though in their own bilateral relationships with the U.S. and the
                            U.S.S.R. the Yugoslavs remained correct and impartial). Similarly, the
                            intensive relations which <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>
                            cultivated with the new African and Asian countries, particularly in the
                            period 1959–1961, were pursued in a spirit which was distinctly
                            anti-Western.</p>
                        <p>All of this was irritating. It was not a situation we could ignore. It
                            called (as did, by that time, other developments as well) for certain
                            adjustments in our treatment of Yugoslavia, including certain
                            curtailments and changes in the aid programs. But <hi rend="italic">it
                                did not invalidate</hi>—and this is the vital point—<hi

                            operating since 1948. Movement in the direction we desired was no doubt
                            slower than it would otherwise have been, as a result of <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s personal attitude; but it was
                            never wholly halted, nor was its pace so slow as to constitute grounds
                            for serious discouragement. Only in one field—that of official <pb
                                n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0319"/>Yugoslav attitudes towards
                            world problems—did all progress appear to have stopped by 1961. But even
                            here there was no ground for despair. The root of the problem lay in the
                            aspirations and attitudes of the Yugoslav President himself. But
                                <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> was no longer young; he
                            was increasingly inactive; the little group of senior officials who
                            supported him in these anti-Western policies was becoming narrower and
                            more isolated; counter-pressures were building up; awareness that
                            Yugoslavia stood to gain from a further development of relations with
                            the West, even at some sacrifice of the old ideological stance, had
                            penetrated into <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s immediate
                            entourage and had affected persons whose authority could reasonably be
                            expected to become greater, and possibly decisive, as his powers
                            declined. There was an excellent prospect that if our cards were played
                            with reasonable dexterity, the pressures for a more forthcoming policy
                            towards us would soon begin to show real effect.</p>
                        <p>All that was required of us, in these circumstances, was a bit more
                            patience, coupled with a somewhat greater effort than had been made in
                            the past to bring the Yugoslavs to realize that the price of our aid and
                            collaboration, over the long run, was a reasonable degree of fairness
                            and objectivity in the approach to ourselves and our problems. There was
                            no reason for despairing of the efficacy of the basic concepts on which
                            our policy had been founded. There was no reason to jettison at this
                            point a long-term approach into which much substance and effort had
                            already been invested, and which had yielded, and was continuing to
                            yield, favorable and promising results. On the contrary, with the
                            growing seriousness of the Russian-Chinese conflict, with the increasing
                            importance of Yugoslavia as a factor in that conflict, and with the
                            sharpness of the financial and economic pressures now coming to bear on
                            the Yugoslav Government, there was, as of 1961, less reason than ever to
                            relax the sort of effort to which we had been committed throughout the
                            previous thirteen years.</p>

                                policy.</hi></p>
                        <p>The above represented, in rough outline, the situation which prevailed in
                            1961, as the present Administration took over in Washington. Yet in the
                            brief intervening period of less than two years, events have occurred in
                            American policy which have not only largely shattered this background of
                            concept and destroyed its present effectiveness but have even begun to
                            jeopardize the important results achieved in the past.</p>
                        <p>With the exception of surplus food (where the Yugoslavs are well aware
                            that internal considerations play a prominent role in our willingness to
                            continue the shipments), existing programs of economic assist-ance have
                            now either come to an end or are approaching their termination; and the
                            Executive Branch has been deprived of almost all discretion and
                            flexibility with respect to the negotiation of new ones. No <pb n="298"

                            been extended to the Yugoslavs since March 1961. They have been
                            virtually cut off from purchasing of new items of military equipment in
                            the U.S., even in instances where the items in question are obsolescent
                            to our own use and unclassified, and even when they are willing to pay
                            cash. They have been abruptly faced with legislation calling for denial
                            to them of most-favored-nation customs treatment for Yugoslav goods,
                            which they had enjoyed for more than seventy years. In this way they
                            have been threatened with curtailment of their possibilities for earning
                            their own way in economic relations with our country.</p>
                        <p>By consequence of, and in connection with, these events, Yugoslav trade
                            and credit have already been materially damaged. The Yugoslavs find
                            themselves faced with a whole series of spontaneous harassments at the
                            hands of private circles in our country: boycotts and withdrawals of
                            existing orders for their goods; public burning of Yugoslav products at
                            American supermarkets; impairment of their facilities for obtaining
                            commercial credit; refusal to their vessels of facilities for loading
                            and unloading at American ports. Even the intellectual exchange program
                            of the University of Texas had to be abandoned at that university and
                            transferred to another region of the country, in deference to the
                            prevailing mood of anti-Yugoslavism. A further blow, directly connected
                            with the <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> decision, is the inclusion
                            of Yugoslavia among the countries affected by the Cunningham Amendment
                            in PL 87–793.</p>
                        <p>For all of this drastic deterioration in their treatment at our hands,
                            going in many instances beyond anything they suffered when they were a
                            Soviet satellite, no official reason has to my knowledge yet been
                            tendered to the Yugoslavs by any responsible quarter in our country. No
                            one has troubled himself to inform them what the Congressional grievance
                            against them is, for what they are being punished, and just what they
                            could be expected by us to do if they wished to avoid these
                            manifestations of our disfavor. People have told them that the Executive
                            Branch disapproves of certain of the legislative measures that have been
                            taken; but no one has told them what it is, specifically, that Congress
                            has taken exception to in their behavior, or what sort of concessions on
                            their part would again entitle them even to the normal trade treatment
                            accorded to other non-aligned countries.</p>
                        <p>The Yugoslavs can of course deduce, from the terms of the legislation as
                            well as from the nature of the domestic discussion in our country, that
                            they are being penalized because they are nominally “communist.” This is
                            a point at which they themselves, as will be seen below, contribute to
                            their own difficulties by insisting on retaining this term in the name
                            of the ruling party. They are well aware, as are all foreign observers
                            who have seen anything of Yugoslavia, that neither in point of domestic
                            institutions nor of foreign policy does their position correspond <pb
                                n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0321"/>to that of the real “communist”
                            countries. Their entire effort, furthermore, over 13 years, has been to
                            prove by the tenor of their behavior in relations with Western countries
                            that cordial and mutually profitable relations can exist between a
                            country which calls itself “socialist”—or even “communist,” if you
                            will—and non-communist countries, provided there is good will on both
                            sides. To be told in effect (and this is the clear inference of the
                            Congressional action) that we do not accept this principle, that they
                            must suffer at our hands simply because they call themselves “socialist”
                            or “communist,” and that their actual behavior towards us in bilateral
                            relations is neither here nor there: this is one of the most devastating
                            blows they could receive, for it shatters the entire basis on which they
                            have tried to construct their relationship with Western countries over
                            recent years. It means that the price of a good relationship with our
                            country is the one thing they cannot possibly do without denying their
                            own political past and placing in question the legitimacy of their own
                            regime: namely to renounce publicly and completely their belief in the
                            principles of socialism.</p>
                        <p>This situation is not greatly ameliorated by the fact that the most
                            serious and conspicuous of these various anti-Yugoslav measures have
                            been taken over the stated disapproval of the Executive Branch of our
                            government. The Yugoslavs are obliged, after all, to deal with the
                            end-product of our governmental action. They must look at our government
                            as a whole. They are not greatly comforted by the fact that initiatives
                            of which they are the victims were ineffectively opposed here and there
                            within our own governmental counsels. They are aware that the Executive
                            Branch of the Government has on occasions stated its opposition to these
                            measures. They are also aware that it has not done this very
                            emphatically, nor has it made a serious effort to correct the moods and
                            misunderstandings of public opinion out of which these measures arose.
                            They are further aware that in certain instances the Executive Branch
                            has even deferred to these same moods and misunderstandings in the
                            shaping of measures which lay within its own discretion—particularly in
                            the field of military affairs and of matters lying within the purview of
                            departments and agencies other than the Department of State.</p>
                        <p>It is not possible to estimate how much damage has already been done by
                            this state of affairs. The Yugoslavs have repeatedly stated that
                            U.S.-Yugoslav relations have already been adversely affected. They have
                            warned us that this effect will be much more adverse still, and will
                            probably affect our “positions” in this country (primarily, we must
                            assume, the <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> establishment) if the
                                <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> provision is not soon reversed
                            by the new Congress. It is certain, in any case, that much bitterness
                            has been created on the Yugoslav side. People who were once inclined to
                            argue for a closer relationship with us, and with the West generally, no
                            longer feel that they have grounds for doing so; those who have never
                                <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0322"/>liked the Western
                            orientation are triumphing; calculations are being arrived at, plans
                            made, positions and steps taken in foreign policy, all under the
                            impression that American policy has turned decisively, for the moment,
                            at least, against good relations with Yugoslavia—that important, and
                            thus far decisive, forces in American society are determined that the
                            doors of economic collaboration and even normal trade shall remain
                            closed to Yugoslavia—and that the Executive Branch, while not sharing
                            this view, is not prepared to undertake vigorous public opposition to
                            it. By the same token, those of us who have tried in recent years to
                            persuade the Yugoslavs that a close and fruitful association with our
                            country lays open to them any time they wished to take advantage of it,
                            are now effectively silenced.</p>
                        <p>All of this, let us note, is occurring at a time of greatest delicacy and
                            cruciality in world events, when relationships within the communist bloc
                            are shaken and unstable as never before; when the Yugoslavs are in
                            particular need of outside economic and financial support; when Soviet
                            policy has changed in such a way as to offer to Yugoslavia much more
                            inviting prospects for fruitful collaboration than at any time in recent
                            years.</p>
                        <p>Looked at in its entirety, this all spells, as I see it, the virtual
                            collapse, at a singularly unfortunate moment, of a policy which has been
                            pursued over a long series of years, which had yielded good results and
                            promised to continue to yield them, and which there was no objective
                            reason to abandon.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">6. What has produced this
                                collapse?</hi></p>
                        <p>While this is a question, parts of which could be better answered in
                            Washington than here, the following observations may not be wholly
                            irrelevant.</p>
                        <p>We must recognize first that the policy pursued towards Yugoslavia
                            throughout the 1950s never commanded full public understanding or
                            support at home. There was always opposition to it—not wide popular
                            opposition, but an opposition composed, as I see it, primarily of two
                            very vigorous and vocal special interests.</p>
                        <p>The first of these was made up of the Yugoslav refugee elements,
                            supported by allies among various other groups of refugees from Eastern
                            Europe, and by such members of Congress and other participants in
                            political life as were either sincerely moved to sympathy or anxious to
                            cultivate their favor and to appear as their spokesmen. These refugee
                            elements in question were, and continue to be, powerful groups. They
                            have enjoyed important support in American religious circles. Their aims
                            and calculations seem often to have little to do with U.S. interests. In
                            many instances, their main concern appears to have been to produce as
                            rapidly as possible a state of war between the U.S. and the Soviet
                            Union, <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301" facs="0323"/>in the hope, presumably,
                            that this will facilitate their own return to residence and power in
                            their homelands. To these people, any suggestion that the U.S. should
                            recognize distinctions between one “communist” government and another is
                            of course anathema. To admit that a “communist” or “socialist” regime
                            could be worthy of toleration at our hands just because it broke its
                            ties to Moscow, ceased efforts at the subversion of our country, and
                            permitted its internal institutions to develop along Western patterns,
                            would be to accept the frustration of their own political ambitions. To
                            admit even the possibility of a gradual evolution of communist countries
                            in the direction of greater liberality would weaken the credibility of
                            their view that war is the only answer. The fact that this is so, and
                            that the aims of these people are often unconnected with American
                            interests, has unfortunately not prevented many prominent American
                            figures from espousing their interpretations of world events and
                            repeating their propagandistic slogans.</p>
                        <p>The second of the two elements to whom I refer is made up of those
                            extreme right-wing American groups who feel themselves under the
                            necessity of demonstrating that all elements in American political life
                            except themselves are the agents, conscious or unconscious, of a
                            communist conspiracy in our midst. To these people, a policy of friendly
                            collaboration and assistance addressed to “communist” Yugoslavia has
                            naturally provided an attractive target for criticism. The less U.S.
                            policy towards the Soviet Union and the bloc countries has shown itself
                            vulnerable to attack on point of “softness,” the more Yugoslavia has
                            loomed as the last example on which an American policy inspired by
                            direct communist influences or by fatuous naivete towards “communism” in
                            the Department of State could be plausibly argued. These elements, like
                            the refugees, not only have no desire to take account of the
                            peculiarities that distinguish Yugoslavia from the remaining bloc
                            countries but react with particular violence, for obvious reasons, to
                            any suggestion that these peculiarities exist or deserve
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>The influence of these two groups over broader sections of the public has
                            been strengthened in recent years by the growing general impatience with
                            the cold war and by the prevailing popular mood of exasperation towards
                            those nations which call themselves neutral. To the extent one persuades
                            one’s self that whoever is not with us is against us, the rationale of a
                            policy towards Yugoslavia different from policy towards the communist
                            bloc in general becomes unsubstantial.</p>
                        <p>Both refugees and right-wingers have of course been happy to exploit the
                            semantic confusion presented by the term “communist.” In this respect,
                            they are only taking advantage of a tool obligingly placed at their
                            disposal by the Yugoslav leaders themselves. It is characteristic of
                                <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s psychology that
                            although his regime no longer corresponds to general Western concept of
                            the term “communist” any more than it corresponds <pb n="302"
                                xml:id="pg_302" facs="0324"/>to the general Eastern concept of the
                            term “capitalist,” he prefers it to be called “communist,” hoping this
                            will render it more respectable in Eastern eyes, than to abandon this
                            inaccurate term with a view to making it more respectable in Western
                            ones. He wants, in truth, to have his cake and eat it, too: to see his
                            regime respected and well-treated in the East because it calls itself
                            “communist,” and to see it respected and well-treated in the West
                            because it is not really so. In this sense, Yugoslavs have an
                            appreciable share of the blame for the misunderstanding of their
                            position which has become so widespread in our country and elsewhere in
                            the West.</p>
                        <p>I am increasingly impressed with the difficulty of the problem this
                            presents. Any effort on our part to clear away this semantic confusion
                            not only involves us at once in the tangled question of “what is
                            communism?” but creates difficulties with the Yugoslavs themselves. To
                            tell the world that Yugoslavia is not really communist is to deprive
                                <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> of his fondest pretense,
                            to proclaim his ideological nakedness, and to do him what he conceives
                            to be a great political disservice. He insists, in effect, on the right
                            of making it semantically difficult for us to help him. His defense
                            would be that we should not be misled by semantic symbols—that there is
                            no reason why we should not be prepared to have a normal relationship
                            with a “communist” country, if it is prepared to be correct and
                            collaborative in its approach to us. All of this, again, is irritating.
                            But I do not see that it absolves us of the obligation to try to see
                            things as they are and to teach our people to do likewise. There is
                            nothing in our book that says we have to be permanently the victims of
                            other people’s deliberately perpetrated semantic confusion.</p>
                        <p>These reflections lead directly to another important cause of the
                            situation we have before us. This is the shocking failure of the
                            American press to give the American public in recent years anything like
                            an adequate picture of the situation in Yugoslavia and of the basis on
                            which American policy has rested. It is clear that wide and influential
                            sections of the American public have only the dimmest idea, if any, of
                            the distinctions between Yugoslavia and the countries of the Soviet
                            bloc, of the stake the West has in the preservation of Yugoslavia’s
                            independence, and of the real nature of our policy and approaches. At
                            the present moment, there is no full-fledged American, or indeed
                            Western, correspondent in Belgrade. The news agencies are represented
                            only by local stringers who are not in position to give any frank
                            interpretive picture of conditions here. It is characteristic that even
                            the sophisticated American reading public has to this day been given no
                            idea of the gravity of the effect of recent Congressional actions on
                            Yugoslav-American relations.</p>
                        <p>For this state of affairs, too, responsibility is widely divided. The
                            Yugoslav Government bears a considerable share of the blame by virtue of
                            the negativism and neglect it has shown towards Western press <pb
                                n="303" xml:id="pg_303" facs="0325"/>representatives in recent
                            years. The American press, in its turn, has lent itself extensively to
                            pressures brought to bear by the refugee and right-wing groups. Its own
                            professional distortions, involving a love for generalizing concepts
                            under simple catchy adjectives (“communist Yugoslavia,” “red
                            Yugoslavia,” “Yugoslavia’s communist dictator,” etc.) have caused it to
                            collaborate in multiplying the semantic confusion caused by the use of
                            the term “communist.” Added to this has been the failure of the
                            Executive Branch of the Government to convey in any adequate way to the
                            public its own ideas and approaches with regard to Yugoslavia.</p>
                        <p>This last has been the reflection, again, of a situation within our
                            Government which I have no choice but to mention. I trust the Department
                            will not take umbrage if I treat this subject frankly, for it lies at
                            the heart of many of our difficulties. The fact is that in recent years
                            the conceptual impulses and the enthusiasm for the policies we have
                            ostensibly followed toward Yugoslavia have come primarily from a very
                            narrow group of persons in the Department of State who have had the
                            stimulus of daily confrontation with the realities of U.S.-Yugoslav
                            relations at the working level, and have labored with great patience and
                            devotion to try to get sound concepts of policy established and
                            implemented. These people have often been permitted to initiate action
                            of one sort or another; but due to the present far-flung quality of our
                            governmental apparatus, to the lack of intimacy among its various
                            sections, and to the ulterior preoccupations of senior officials, they
                            have had only inadequate facilities for gaining understanding elsewhere
                            for what they were doing. The policies they have recommended have
                            usually been formally approved; but approval has come too often from
                            harried, overworked, and distracted superiors, whose own initiative and
                            personal interest was not greatly engaged, who were willing to let the
                            ideas in question ride as far as they could on their own steam along the
                            road of governmental implementation, but who felt no great sense of
                            personal commitment or conviction, and were not prepared to support
                            these policies very vigorously if they ran into serious opposition
                            either in Congress or in other agencies of the Executive Branch. The
                            result was that few people, even in the Executive Branch, understood
                            fully what it was that we were trying to do, and there were fewer still
                            who could explain it to people outside. The people who knew something
                            about U.S.-Yugoslav relations and understood fully the rationale of
                            policy were not the people who had the facilities for talking to the
                            public, and vice versa.</p>
                        <p>All this has led not only to a serious failure of communication between
                            Department and the public, but to an equally serious failure within the
                            Executive family itself. It is clear that what was recorded on paper as
                            policy towards Yugoslavia has never commanded complete confidence or
                            understanding even in important echelons of the Executive <pb n="304"
                                xml:id="pg_304" facs="0326"/>Branch, particularly those that enjoy a
                            special intimacy with Congressional committees. We have seen repeated
                            examples of ignorance or disbelief, sometimes even within the Department
                            of State itself, for the proposition that Yugoslavia is not a member of
                            the Soviet bloc. I have yet to see evidence that this proposition has
                            been fully accepted by the F.B.I., by the security authorities of the
                            Department of State, or by those internal authorities which deal with
                            such matters as visas, re-entry permits, and export controls, not to
                            mention wide echelons of the military establishment. In all of these
                            places we encounter not only persistent disbelief for State Department
                            concepts and interpretations with relation to Yugoslavia but often
                            direct resistance to the logical implementation of established policy in
                            fields of action under their control. It is clear that even if public
                            misunderstanding could be corrected, there would still have to be a
                            greater discipline and coordination of policy within the Executive
                            Branch itself if a constructive policy towards Yugoslavia were to be
                            consistently pursued.</p>
                        <p>As a result of this, it is not surprising that our present position with
                            relation to Yugoslavia is contradictory, unproductive, and
                            unsatisfactory. It consists, for the most part, of a series of heroic
                            struggles with ourselves. We try, with the one hand, to strengthen the
                            Yugoslav economy; with the other, we move to damage it. With one hand,
                            we lend them money; with the other, we make it difficult for them to
                            earn the money with which to repay us. We maintain in Belgrade a
                            high-powered team of talented and experienced people whose task it is to
                            try to make Yugoslavs think well of us and have confidence in us; at the
                            same time, we commit, or allow to be privately committed, act after act
                            designed to give offense to the feelings of all Yugoslavs, communist or
                            non-communist, private or official. After spending years encouraging the
                            Yugoslavs to render themselves militarily independent of Moscow, we then
                            take measures which oblige them, after an interruption of more than a
                            decade, to turn once more to Moscow for new purchases of military
                            equipment. We claim that we wish to encourage greater independence from
                            Moscow on the part of communist countries; yet when one of them
                            genuinely establishes its independence, we treat it in some respects
                            worse than we did before its independence was achieved. We spend years
                            trying to persuade Yugoslav leaders and others that there is no reason
                            why a socialist country should not have a mutually profitable
                            relationship with the West; yet we take restrictive action against them
                            for which we are unwilling to assign any specific reason and which they
                            must assume to have been taken precisely and only because they are
                            socialist.</p>
                        <p>I could continue with the list. I am sure I do not need to do so. It is
                            amply clear that no really effective policy can be conducted against
                            such a background.</p>

                        <p>The present situation confronts us with two requirements. The first is to
                            recover sufficient freedom of action on the part of the Executive Branch
                            to enable it once again to formulate policy toward Yugoslavia with
                            reasonable hope of being able to implement it in a sustained and
                            persuasive manner. This means, of course, the repeal of the legislative
                            provisions requiring denial of <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>
                            treatment to Yugoslavia and restricting the ability of the Executive
                            Branch to include Yugoslavia among the normal recipients of American
                            aid. If and when these objectives have been accomplished, we will still
                            be confronted with the task of reconstructing an effective policy toward
                            Yugoslavia on the basis of the experience we have gathered in the past
                            and in the face of what will, certainly, be a somewhat altered
                            international situation.</p>
                        <p>For both of these tasks—the negative one of removing existing
                            restrictions and the positive one of charting a new and sound policy—we
                            will require a climate of public opinion, and a background of
                            understanding throughout our own official establishment, wholly
                            different from that with which we are now confronted. Without a
                            far-reaching change for the better in this respect, it is unlikely that
                            we will get very far with the correction of the present situation.</p>
                        <p>All this seems to me to bespeak the necessity of a major educational
                            effort, designed to gain understanding among the public, among members
                            of Congress and their various staffs, and among the far-flung echelons
                            of the Executive Branch, for a number of fairly basic and simple
                            propositions concerning conditions in Yugoslavia and the bases of our
                            policy. I cannot undertake here to give an exhaustive listing of these
                            propositions; but the following would be examples of what I have in
                            mind. An understanding of these alone would go very far towards putting
                            us in the clear: <list>

                                    point a Presidential statement of more than casual nature. It
                                    should involve several public statements or speeches by other
                                    high officials. An effort should be made to find qualified
                                    younger men who can go around the country, to foreign affairs
                                    study groups, universities, etc., with a view to explaining both
                                    the objective facts and the bases of our policy. In addition to
                                    this, there will have to be high-level approaches to key figures
                                    in the press: and not just to two or three of them, but to all
                                    who are important in this connection. Particular importance
                                    should be attached to publishers of the weekly news magazines.
                                    Governmental specialists will know best what use should be made
                                    of radio and television. I would emphasize, however, that what
                                    is involved here is not just a one-time statement but a
                                    persistent, prolonged effort, in which full advantage is taken
                                    of the factor of repetition. The moods and misunderstandings we
                                    are <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307" facs="0329"/>trying to counter
                                    were not created in a day, and they will not be destroyed by
                                    one-time impacts. The Washington columnists would be of great
                                    help in this, if they would; and I can see no reason why any of
                                    them should not be talked to.</p></item>

                                <p>A successful approach to the press would itself be probably the
                                    most important single factor in gaining Congressional
                                    understanding for what we are trying to do. The
                                    misunderstandings I personally encountered just during my own
                                    peregrinations around Capitol Hill last summer were appalling.
                                    But there is also need for thorough and leisurely consultation
                                    with Congressional leaders—something in the way of seminars,
                                    designed not to wheedle them into supporting a policy they do
                                    not understand but rather to enlisting their responsibility as
                                    co-architects of a policy that will hold water. It ought, as I
                                    see it, to be borne in upon them that they cannot remain without
                                    responsibility in this respect, and that if they insist on
                                    confining themselves to purely negative and destructive
                                    strictures on the freedom of the Executive, with a view to
                                    preventing it from pursuing any policy at all, the whole case
                                    will have to be taken before the public and there will have to
                                    be something in the nature of an Executive disclaimer of
                                    responsibility for the consequences.</p>
                                <p>I believe that consultations with Congressional leaders could
                                    well be supplemented by similar consultations with the leaders
                                    of religious groups which have supported negative approaches to
                                    the problem of policy toward Yugoslavia.</p></item>

                                <p>I am not sufficiently familiar with current procedures for
                                    devising and implementing policy to make recommendations as to
                                    how we should proceed to assure a better coordination of concept
                                    and policy within the Executive Branch of the Government. I
                                    should think that a new White House-level paper, summing up the
                                    bases and nature of our policy towards Yugoslavia, and designed
                                    to have validity with all departments and agencies, would be
                                    very useful. I would hope there would be some procedure by which
                                    we could bring into the preparation of such a paper the
                                    representatives of those sections of the Executive Branch of the
                                    Government which have shown to date the greatest skepticism
                                    about the soundness of established policy and the least
                                    willingness to collaborate in its implementation.</p></item>
                        </list>
                        <p>I think it particularly important that an effort be made to straighten
                            out our armed services on the subject of policy toward Yugoslavia, and
                            not just the staff of the Department of Defense in Washington but also
                            the various staff colleges and above all the commanders in the field.
                            There have been indications that understanding for the situation in
                            Yugoslavia <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0330"/>and for our policy
                            toward this country in many outlying headquarters and commands is
                            substantially nil.</p>
                        <p>This, as I see it, is what the situation calls for. I have refrained here
                            from going into the specifics of what our future policy towards
                            Yugoslavia ought to be. The course I have suggested is designed merely
                            to enable us to regain the flexibility of action, on the part of the
                            Executive Branch, without which any attempt to chart out policy is an
                            empty exercise. Obviously, to be effective, the sort of campaign I have
                            suggested will take high-level interest and authority; and it will mean
                            that a great many people will have to trouble themselves seriously, and
                            in a coordinated way, about this problem. I see no satisfactory
                            alternative. In the absence of a major effort of this sort, the tendency
                            will unquestionably be to continue to do as we have done in the past: to
                            hatch out what we would like to see as policy in the form of papers
                            written in one narrow compartment of the State Department; to try by
                            various private pleas and tactical devices to gain the collaboration, in
                            the implementation of this policy, of a host of people who have no
                            understanding for its conceptual basis and rationale; and finally, when
                            confronted not only with frustration but with injunctions to proceed
                            along contrary lines in certain fields, then to go ahead with this
                            contradictory conduct, being careful at no point to draw any difficult
                            public issues. It is, of course, this procedure of attempting to solve
                            the problem by tactical devices while avoiding the great issues of
                            intellectual understanding underlying it, which has brought us to our
                            present embarrassments. I have no hesitation in saying that if we can
                            see nothing better than this to do in the future, we would do just as
                            well to confess ourselves subjectively incapable of coping with a
                            foreign affairs problem such as that presented to us by Yugoslavia, and
                            then to fold up our tents, before the Yugoslavs fold them up for us, and
                            figuratively to steal away. Such a confession of inadequacy would,
                            however, be so far from our tradition, and its implications would be so
                            devastating for the future of our diplomacy vis-à-vis not just
                            Yugoslavia but many other areas as well, that one simply cannot
                            contemplate it. There is no reason at all to despair of the progress
                            that could yet be made through the consistent pursuit of liberal and
                            flexible policies toward Yugoslavia. If the price of the privilege of
                            conducting such a policy is a major effort to straighten out American
                            opinion and to obtain better understanding for what is admittedly a
                            baffling and complicated problem of international affairs, I am sure
                            this price is still small compared to the implications of an inability
                            or unwillingness to pay it.</p>

                            <p>After completion of the above, it has been called to my attention
                                that in the description in the initial passages of the paper on U.S.
                                policy from 1948 to 1961, no mention was made of the effort to
                                assure Yugo-slavia’s military defense against attack from the East
                                in the early years after the break with Moscow, nor was mention made
                                later on of the fact that the absence of such an attack could be
                                listed among the achievements of U.S. policy. How great the danger
                                of military attack really was, and to what extent our military aid
                                served as an effective deterrent, will never be fully known.
                                Certainly this was one of the purposes which our military aid was
                                originally conceived as serving, and to the extent the danger was
                                real this aid must be considered to have been useful and
                                effective.</p>

                            policy toward Yugoslavia which raises critical questions about our

                        <p>In essence, he charges that our policy toward Yugoslavia has been
                            basically revised not by design intention but rather by a series of
                            separate steps, unrelated to foreign policy consideration, and, in his
                            view, the end result has been that our present stance is “contradictory,
                            unproductive and unsatisfactory.” He feels (and in this he is generally
                            supported by the Executive Departments most directly concerned) that
                            U.S. interests would be served better by reverting to the policy lines
                            first formulated during the Truman Administration than by adhering to
                            the present course brought about by recent Congressional action.</p>

                                more than detached interest. People have long speculated whether
                                Yugoslav practices and institutions could be brought sufficiently
                                into conformity with those of bloc to permit Yugoslavia’s
                                reintegration. That such reconciliation should be effected, in part
                                at least, by bringing bloc practices and institutions into greater
                                conformity with those of Yugoslavia presents new and interesting

                            <item>Central purpose of <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>, in
                                these discussions in Russia, must be to achieve elimination from
                                binding resolutions of Russian Party Congress and of international
                                body of communist parties of postulate that dogmatism and
                                revisionism are both dangers but revisionism is greater of two. He
                                surely desires to see revisionist portion of this formula junked
                                entirely and to have it formally acknowledged that Yugoslav
                                socialism represents neither revisionism nor any other sort of
                                deviation but merely a respectable variant of Marxist-socialist
                                practice, properly tailored to specific needs and possibilities of
                                Yugoslav people. Presumably, such doctrinal readjustment could be
                                formally effected only by new international gathering of communist
                                parties and by new Russian Party Congress. So far as Russian Party
                                concerned I assume that in light recent events prospects for
                                elimination of offensive formula at a new congress would be more
                                favorable today than they were last year, though there would still
                                be bitter opposition. Such change in Russian Party doctrine would in
                                any case be neither fitting nor effective unless it occurred in
                                harmony with and pursuant to, similar readjustments of doctrine on
                                part of bloc as whole. However, to convene new gathering of parties
                                with view to eliminating this formula would, as things stand today,
                                surely be to invite open and final split with Chinese over this
                                issue. To convene a rump meeting without Chinese group would be to
                                acknowledge and formalize split before Congress ever convened. And
                                if formula should be altered or removed, further question would at
                                once <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312" facs="0334"/>arise as to
                                relationship of Yugoslavs, now formally recognized as respectable,
                                to future international communist gatherings. Yugoslavs would be
                                unlikely to resubmit themselves to bloc discipline and to bind
                                themselves in advance to respect and implement collective decisions
                                sight unseen. Yet if revisionism were no longer “greater danger,”
                                would there be adequate rationale for their exclusion from regular
                                gatherings to which dogmatist Chinese were being admitted? Role
                                Yugoslavs were permitted to play at recent Italian Party
                                    Congress,<note n="3" xml:id="d142fn3">At the December 2–8
                                    Italian Party Congress, the Yugoslav delegate was invited to
                                    address the meeting and received prolonged applause.</note>
                                where concept of “observers” was apparently stretched quite far,
                                illustrates urgency this problem. In short, <persName

                                independence of policy strikes at heart of present ambiguities in
                                intra-bloc relationships and may operate to heighten still further
                                present divisive tendencies.</item>

                            <item>Yugoslav desires do not necessarily run to producing a split
                                between China and remainder of bloc. One should not be misled by
                                anguished Yugoslav reactions to Chinese attacks. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> admires Chinese Communists and
                                would like, for his part, to have had good relations with them. His
                                response to Chinese hostility has not been lasting embitterment or
                                even appreciation for imperialistic and misanthropic nature of
                                Chinese Communist regime, but something more like the disappointment
                                of unrequited love. In his eyes cruelest and most Marxist-Communist
                                regime remains more attractive than most liberal non-Communist
                                government. Were Chinese to turn around and treat him well, as
                                Russians are doing, he would glow with satisfaction; and it would
                                cost him no more to forget their previous insults than it does to
                                forget, as he speaks today in Volgograd of wartime Soviet-Yugoslavia
                                collaboration, the countless slights and atrocities suffered by
                                Yugoslavs at hands of Red Army Forces on Yugoslav soil in

                                red-carpet treatment and applause of multitudes in Russia,
                                Yugoslavia’s relations with the West, marked by effects of US
                                Congressional actions, renewed strain on relations with Germany
                                resulting from attack on Yugoslav mission in Godesberg, cold
                                shoulder presented by Common Market, and growing indifference of
                                that portion of Western public opinion which is not actively
                                hostile, are at lowest ebb in years. Obviously, one could conceive
                                of no situation better designed to facilitate reconciliation of
                                Yugoslavia with bloc. It is clear that burden of maintenance of
                                Yugoslav independence vis-à-vis Moscow has now come to rest
                                primarily on sense of self-interest of Yugoslavs themselves, in
                                sense that for first time since 1948 it is scarcely supported by any
                                counter-attractions in field of Yugoslav relations with <pb n="313"
                                    xml:id="pg_313" facs="0335"/>the West. It has been proven that
                                Yugoslav independence can be maintained in face of reasonable
                                balance in potential advantages of friendship with the two sides.
                                Whether it can be maintained when scales are sharply tipped in favor
                                of East, when West has little to offer and Russians much, is now
                                being tested. Perhaps it can. <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                    >Tito</persName> will of course see no reason to make
                                concessions at expense of his independence where he has won so much
                                without them. But situation is still precarious. If in these
                                circumstances present clarification of Yugoslav relations with bloc
                                ends in manner not detrimental to Western interests, Western powers
                                will deserve credit for luck rather than for effort.</item>

                            <item>Seriousness this situation is heightened by fact that effect of
                                recent events, as I see it, can only be to cause further
                                deterioration in climate of Western opinion concerning Yugoslavia.
                                In light of Cuba and Indo-Chinese conflict, Yugoslavia’s claim to be
                                simultaneously non-aligned and socialist, non-aligned for benefit of
                                West and socialist for benefit of East, is wearing dangerously thin.
                                Yugoslav position was revealed in each of these cases as distinctly
                                more socialist than unaligned. At same time, these same conflicts
                                tended to spotlight certain major elements of fraudulence in
                                Marxist-Leninist socialist doctrine: Among others, theses that true
                                socialist country cannot be author of aggression, that socialism is
                                interested only in peace, and that triumph of socialist cause is
                                inevitable and inexorable. All this is bound to stimulate increased
                                impatience even in liberal circles abroad for professed Yugoslav
                                adherence to these principles and skepticism as to its sincerity—a
                                skepticism which will be misplaced primarily only in case of
                                    <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> himself and a few
                                ossified followers and I see therefore a further widening of gap
                                between <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s outmoded
                                attachment to Marxism-Leninism and needs of Yugo-slavia’s

                            and intentions with which he returned from Moscow. After careful study
                            his various statements, we are forced to conclusion that what is implied
                            does indeed represent in several respects an essential change in Yugo
                            relationship to bloc. This is first time we see evidence of intention to
                            make important changes in internal Yugo practices (crackdown on Western
                            cultural influences, increased pressure for collectivization, et cetera)
                            with view to aligning them with those of bloc and thus narrowing
                            ideological differences. This is first time we hear it suggested that
                            Soviet armed forces have role in defense of Yugo socialism. This is
                            first time we note disposition, at least on part of <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> personally, to back off from use of
                            term “nonaligned” with reference to Yugo itself. We cannot ignore fact
                            failure to join bloc formally now publicly motivated not by alleged
                            iniquity of Soviet bloc politics, as in previous <persName
                                corresp="#p_KE1">Kardelj</persName> thesis, or by concern for
                            maintenance acceptable relations with West, but by tactical
                            considerations pertaining to relations with Afro-Asian states, which
                            considerations <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> indicates also
                            serve Soviet interests. Cracks against West are not new, but failure
                            throughout series of statements to balance them with even most
                            perfunctory phrases of reassurance re future course Western-Yugo
                            relations contrasts sharply with <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName>’s behavior when he returned from Moscow in 1956 and
                            is flagrant and provocative, especially when taken with his contemptuous
                            repudiation of Western sympathies for Yugo system.</p>
                        <p>It is clear <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> does not have in
                            mind any normal reassociation with bloc at this stage. What he does
                            contemplate is heightened moral and political support for USSR in
                            international arena, farreaching effort to narrow ideological gap
                            between the two systems, and gradual shifting Yugo position from that of
                            nonaligned country cooperating closely with <pb n="316" xml:id="pg_316"
                                facs="0338"/>nonaligned group. These changes, if followed, would
                            leave Yugo’s independent status drained of a good portion its previous
                            value for us, and would oblige us, in my opinion, to revise assessment
                            of Yugo’s position on which our policy has rested to date.</p>
                        <p>Department will please bear in mind that in absence any effective US
                            press reporting from Yugo facts on which this judgment based are wholly
                            unknown to US and large parts of world public, but they are familiar to
                            all thoughtful observers here.</p>
                        <p>In deciding on this turn of policy, <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName> must have been guided by any or all three of
                            following considerations: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>(A) That US aid and friendship no longer vital to his regime, (B)
                                    that our motives in giving aid are so subjective and our fear of
                                    Yugo’s formal return to bloc so great that we will continue to
                                    extend certain programs and favors (notably PL 480) regardless
                                    of his stance, (C) that value of collaboration with US has been
                                    greatly reduced any way by virtue its unreliability in light of
                                    US Congressional and public opinion.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Probably all three considerations play a part, but I suspect (A) would be
                            valid for him personally, even if others did not apply. This would not
                            be true of many in his entourage, who are well aware of vital importance
                            of continuation of PL 480.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s new line has been sprung
                            unexpectedly on country. No evidence prior consultation or discussions
                            in senior party XV [<hi rend="italic">or</hi>?] governmental bodies.
                            Obviously no preparation public opinion. Press and Foreign Office
                            apparently left flatfooted. No evidence that story [<hi rend="italic"
                                >effort</hi>?] has even been made at working out coherent rationale
                            on various informational fronts. Until this process undertaken and
                            completed situation in policy making echelons will continue be one of
                            considerable uncertainty and disarray.</p>
                        <p>We cannot tell at this stage to what extent <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName>’s line will be actually implemented. It will arouse
                            much discontent and opposition within hierarchy. In past, there has been
                            tendency to let him talk but to go on with business as usual in absence
                            specific instructions. It is significant that since his return from
                            Russia Yugo press has treated his statements and whole subject
                            Soviet-Yugo relations with stony editorial silence. Obviously, recent
                            statements were intended for Russian ears, not ours. Tanyug agency, in
                            putting out English text of New Year’s message, has already made
                            significant change involving flat mistranslation, designed to conceal
                            from unaligned and Western public full sharpness his original remarks.
                            Possible much of his intent may be sabotaged, compromised, or glossed
                            over in practice. However, previous experience suggests that some will
                            stick. In any case, he is Premier, President, and Party leader and mere
                            utterance by him of such sentiments represents political act of high
                            importance.</p>

                            <item>To date I have tried to work here only through <persName
                                    corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>, appealing to his own sense of
                                self-interest and making it apparent he could have our friendship if
                                he wanted it and was prepared to reciprocate. So deep is now his
                                commitment against us that I feel we have no choice, while not
                                making personal issue of it, but to strive for intensification of
                                forces which oppose his new line. We now have little to lose. Danger
                                of pushing him back into bloc no longer has same significance as
                                before. His reasons for not formally sacrificing his independence at
                                this time have much less to do with us and our aid than was
                                previously the case. On other hand, he proposes, if undeterred, to
                                take his country on path which would in any case cause that
                                independence to lose much of its value for us. For example important

                                    pressure on Yugos is PL-480 agreement, which we have legal right
                                    to suspend or cancel at any time. No evidence Yugos care about
                                    other aid programs. They have no prospect getting new ones
                                    anyway in present circumstances. Continuation PL-480 over coming

                                    procedure should be as follows: I should go to <persName

                                    form, but his recent statements arouse doubt whether this is
                                    still case. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                                        >Kennedy</persName> has instructed me, I should say, to

                                        corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>, would make early public
                                    statement to this effect, making it clear Yugoslavia is not
                                    morally or politically aligned with any outside bloc or
                                    political force. I should insist we can not be satisfied with
                                    private and unpublished assurances. Carefully refrain from
                                    giving any indication what we would do if he fails to make such
                                    statement. Simultaneous and similar statement would be made to

                                    one), President would draw attention publicly to unsatisfactory
                                    implications of <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s
                                    recent statements, would explain that we had waited some time
                                    for some more reassuring word from him but none had been heard,
                                    and would say that he had therefore ordered thorough
                                    re-examination of premises our policy toward Yugoslavia in light
                                    recent events. He would add that pending completion this

                                    would be better to throw them into balance now, while they still

                                    since reasons for Yugoslav’s abstention from formal association
                                    with bloc no longer derive mainly from considerations of
                                    relations with us, I doubt this factor would be decisive. Effect
                                    this action would be to heighten greatly distrust here of

                                    into honorary Presidential position, which could only be in our

                            strikes at the heart of United States policy maintained for over 14
                            years with productive results for the furtherance of United States
                            national interests. <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0342"/>United
                            States policy during the last three Administrations has been based on
                            the conviction that more active relations in economic, cultural, and
                            political fields with the regimes and with the peoples of Eastern Europe
                            can be exploited to increase the presence and influence of the United
                            States within the communist world and, therefore, to support, stimulate
                            and exert some directing force on courses of action more favorable to
                            us. Section 231 repudiates this long-standing policy and leaves as the
                            alternative a policy of isolating Eastern Europe and withdrawal by the
                            United States from the area, abandoning the field to whatever forces may
                            be at work there. Such a policy would be the antithesis of our current
                            policy and the opposite of our national need. A policy of isolation and
                            withdrawal might be appropriate if the United States were faced with a
                            violent solution to the problems between East and West; one in which
                            hostilities were inevitable if not imminent. In any situation where the
                            United States stake must be protected over the long run, however, in
                            circumstances which more closely resemble peace than war, a policy of
                            withdrawal which attempts to isolate the communist world as a whole
                            would be defensive, barren and destined to fail. This judgment is
                            supported by the developments in Eastern Europe over the past decade and
                            a half, as well as by the increasingly apparent opportunities for
                            Western influence in the communist world.</p>
                        <p>Yugoslavia’s defection from international communism in 1948 was a
                            landmark in post-war history. This event was a severe blow to the myth
                            of the monolithic unity of communism and demonstrated that despite
                            Marxist theories and Soviet repression, the Soviet Empire was highly
                            vulnerable to nationalistic forces among the countries under its
                            domination. The effects of Yugoslavia’s defection were immediate. From a
                            strategic viewpoint, the Soviet salient to the Adriatic was pushed back,
                            Soviet pressure on Italy and Greece was relieved and the threat to
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>’s Southeastern flank removed.
                            Politically, Yugoslavia’s defection produced a profound effect within
                            the communist world, the repercussions of which are continuing at the
                            present time. The ability of the Soviet Union to hold together its
                            Empire was called into question, and nationalistic forces within the
                            Soviet bloc were given courage and strengthened.</p>
                        <p>Freed from the necessity to imitate the Soviet system, and exposed to the
                            contagion of Western influences, Yugoslavia has substantially and
                            significantly altered its own economic and political practices. Its
                            unique internal system as well as its position of international
                            independence is at the root of the unbridgeable ideological differences
                            between Yugoslavia and the Sino-Soviet bloc. There is no evidence
                            arising from the latest attempt at a Yugoslav-Soviet rapprochement to
                            indicate that these basic differences can be resolved. On the contrary,
                            the consequences of these differences continue to operate as a divisive
                            influence in the Sino-Soviet <pb n="321" xml:id="pg_321" facs="0343"
                            />bloc. The events of 1956 in Poland and Hungary, Albania’s present
                            defiance of the USSR, and the current Sino-Soviet dispute are all
                            directly traceable in significant measure to Yugoslavia’s independent
                            course since 1948.</p>
                        <p>After the Yugoslav break in 1948, the United States in concert with its
                            Western allies moved quickly to exploit the windfall to Western
                            interests represented by Yugoslavia’s defection from the Soviet bloc.
                            Yugoslavia was given material and psychological support which assisted
                            it in establishing firmly its national independence. Similarly, when in
                            1956 Poland embarked on a more independent, albeit circumscribed, course
                            of action, the United States and other Western countries demonstrated by
                            their support that there was a clear alternative to complete dependence
                            upon, and consequent domination by, the USSR.</p>
                        <p>It is the essence of our policy toward Eastern Europe that those
                            countries which have a will and a capacity to assert and defend their
                            independence can have normal and fruitful relations with the United
                            States. A major instrument of our policy toward such countries has been
                            the provision of assistance, principally in surplus agricultural
                            commodities. Our policy looks forward to the early replacement of such
                            assistance by normal trade and financial relations. It is clear, in any
                            event, that aid is not an acceptable alternative to trade over the long
                            term, either to the United States or to Yugoslavia or Poland. If the
                            past gains of our policy are to be maintained, then we will have to
                            build significant and lasting trade relations with these countries.
                            This, however, will be impossible without authority to extend
                            most-favored-nation benefits.</p>
                        <p>The denial of most-favored-nation benefits will have a serious effect on
                            Yugoslav and Polish trade and economic relations with the United States.
                            Analysis of trade statistics with Yugoslavia indicates that more than 90
                            percent of its exports to the United States would be subject to
                            significantly higher duties. Poland has enjoyed <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >MFN</gloss> benefits since the end of 1960 and thus has only
                            recently begun to develop a market here. The loss of trade with the
                            United States, taken in conjunction with the likely adverse effects of
                            the Common Market on their trade with Western Europe, will leave
                            Yugoslavia and Poland with little confidence in the possibility of
                            relying on fruitful economic relations with the West. We will thus have
                            narrowed their possible courses so that they will be driven back toward
                            economic dependence upon or close association with the Soviet bloc. We
                            will thus have contributed to a goal neither Stalin nor <persName

                            the unity of the communist world.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, by denying Yugoslavia and Poland the ability to earn dollar
                            currency, we will make it impossible for them to service their
                            substantial financial obligations to this country. Yugoslavia’s dollar
                            obligations will increase to $13 million annually beginning in 1964.
                            Poland’s <pb n="322" xml:id="pg_322" facs="0344"/>obligations over the
                            next several years are in excess of $10 million annually, including $2
                            million to be paid to American nationals for claims compensation. In
                            this latter connection, it should be noted that <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >MFN</gloss> benefits were restored to Poland late in 1960 following
                            its agreement to pay $40 million over a twenty-year period to American
                            nationals whose property was nationalized in Poland. Termination of
                                <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> benefits should call into
                            question the continuation of these payments.</p>
                        <p>We have every reason to be greatly encouraged by events in Eastern Europe
                            which are unquestionably running in our favor. There are innumerable
                            evidences that in each of the countries of the European Soviet bloc
                            there are mounting pressures for liberalization, for more nationalistic
                            courses, and for better relations with the West. International communism
                            is being subjected to major centrifugal forces which invite our efforts
                            to increase our presence and influence in Eastern Europe. This is not
                            the time for us to write off our extensive investment in Eastern Europe
                            and to ignore thereby our vital national security interests there. Only
                            Moscow could profit from such action.</p>

                        <p>Soviet-Yugoslav ideological conflict has not been resolved. Measured
                            against backdrop acute Sino-Soviet dispute, it appears to have been
                            reduced to secondary importance in the interests of common anti-Chinese
                            attitude. Such compromise likely to last as long as both sides find it
                            convenient. In contrast to 1956, no agreement on inter-Party affairs
                            announced, nor has there been any claim to agreement beyond field of
                            general foreign policy where Yugoslavs previously admitted substantial
                            identity or similarity of views with USSR. Neither <persName

                            existence of differences although in larger interest common anti-Chinese

                            to make these differences obstacles to increased cooperation. Contrary
                            to Yugoslav hopes, neither Soviet credits nor associate status CEMA
                            obtained; however, these subjects may still be under discussion by
                            economic delegation apparently still in Moscow. In our analysis, from
                            information gathered here from Intelligence and other sources, we see no
                            clear-cut indication at this time that <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"

                            discussions have deflected Yugoslavia from its now long-established
                            internal and foreign policies. Belgrade still appears to have high
                            aspirations to a prominent role among non-aligned nations, and does not
                            appear to have altered its hitherto staunch determination to preserve
                            its independence and to refuse subordinate Yugoslav national interests
                            to foreign alliances or other demands.</p>

                            find their state interests better served by common anti-Chinese
                            attitude. There seems little doubt that Soviet-Yugoslav relations have
                            improved measurably, but this appears to have been largely at Soviet
                            initiative. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s apparent

                            expansive and more imprecise in his public utterances than usual.

                            <item>I consider that the <gloss target="#t_MFN1">m.f.n.</gloss> issue
                                should not be linked in any way to the ups and downs of Yugoslav
                                policy and of <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s
                                statements. The <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0347"/>denial of
                                    <gloss target="#t_MFN1">m.f.n.</gloss> to Yugoslavia was a
                                senseless, destructive action. It was justified neither by the
                                circumstances of the moment at which it was decided by Congress, nor
                                by the circumstances of the present moment. It poisons our entire
                                relationship with the Yugoslavs; no effective constructive action
                                can be taken by either side so long as this restriction remains on
                                the books. It is up to us to get it removed at the earliest possible
                                moment. I hope that the President will see fit to make it known
                                publicly in the very near future that he is asking the Congress to
                                remove it, and I urge that he do so. In so doing, he should make it
                                clear that this has nothing to do with Yugoslav actions or
                                statements of the moment; that the denial of <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                    >m.f.n.</gloss> was itself not in the national interest; and
                                that he cannot take responsibility for handling effectively our
                                relations with this country, which plays so crucial a role in
                                relationships within the communist bloc, unless he can have free
                                hand to guide our economic policy in essential respects as the
                                situation may require. He should emphasize that it is essential to
                                him to have this freedom not just in the present situation but in
                                any conceivable situation.</item>

                            <item>Should the President be disinclined to ask at this time for the
                                removal of the <gloss target="#t_MFN1">m.f.n.</gloss> restriction,
                                then I should like it understood that I am firmly opposed to our
                                undertaking any active diplomatic steps vis-à-vis the Yugoslavs—both
                                now and so long as this situation prevails. This applies to the
                                effort to put pressure on <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>
                                recommended in my recent telegrams. It applies to any other variants
                                of the idea of attempting to communicate with the Yugoslavs in the
                                coming period concerning the state of our mutual relations. So long
                                as the President has not called, clearly and publicly, for a removal
                                of the <gloss target="#t_MFN1">m.f.n.</gloss> restriction, any
                                initiative of this sort would be bound to be misunderstood. It would
                                also be quite inappropriate, in this case, to attempt to implement
                                the ideas of the long airgram I submitted at the beginning of
                                December.</item>

                            <item>This is a very late and crucial moment in our relations with the
                                Yugoslavs. If no initiative is taken by us in the <gloss
                                    target="#t_MFN1">m.f.n.</gloss> matter, we must expect early
                                retaliatory action by the Yugoslavs, which will inflame tempers here
                                and will probably cause the situation to become wholly out of hand.
                                I should not expect, in this case, for example, to see our <gloss
                                    target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> libraries last the winter; and I
                                am sure this would not be the only means found to harass us.</item>

                            <item>Should the President at this time make the request for removal of
                                    <gloss target="#t_MFN1">m.f.n.</gloss>, and in such way that it
                                would be clear to the Yugoslav leaders that he is doing all in his
                                power to achieve the elimination of this restriction, then I
                                continue to favor the use of whatever other cards we have in our
                                hands with a view to putting pressure on <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                    >Tito</persName> and embarrassing him in his effort to lead his
                                country along an anti-Western, anti-liberal, and exclusively
                                pro-Soviet course. But I do not consider that the decision whether
                                or not the President should take this action, or when, <pb n="326"
                                    xml:id="pg_326" facs="0348"/>should be permitted to become a
                                matter of discussion, or bargaining, with the Yugoslavs. We made the

                            <item>I can see no more suitable way for the President to ask for the

                                than in the State of the Union message. Should he wish to broaden
                                this into a request for authority to dispose of his own discretion

                        <p>Yesterday, on January 16, I spoke with the President on the subject of
                            our relations with Yugoslavia, and particularly the question of the
                            denial of most-favored-nation treatment to Yugoslavia. I explained to
                            him that so long as this latter issue remained unresolved, the effect of
                            the Congress’ action was to paralyze our policy towards Yugoslavia and
                            to make it impossible for us to undertake useful initiatives.</p>

                        <p>The following is my understanding of the President’s views as expressed
                            in this conversation: <list>
                                <label>(a)</label>
                                <item>There has been suggested to him some sort of a scheme whereby
                                    action to achieve the removal of the <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                        >m.f.n.</gloss> denial would be initiated not in connection
                                    with the Trade Bill but rather in connection with the new Aid
                                    legislation. This proposal was not explained to me in detail,
                                    but I gained the impression that the initiative was to be taken
                                    by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The President, as I
                                    understand it, is favorably disposed towards this suggestion,
                                    and means to pursue it.</item>

                                <item>With a view to facilitating this procedure, he wished me to
                                    see Senators Fulbright and Mansfield and to present to them my
                                    views on the effects of the <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                        >m.f.n.</gloss> denial.</item>

                                <item>The President considered that if this procedure were
                                    successful, action could scarcely be expected in less than 5 to
                                    6 months.</item>
                                <label>(d)</label>
                                <item>The President was prepared to consider making a public
                                    statement about the <gloss target="#t_MFN1">m.f.n.</gloss>
                                    problem in reply to a question at his press conference. He
                                    desired that I should submit to him a suggestion for wording he
                                    might use in this connection.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The President said he thought he had been told he had sixteen months’
                            grace in denouncing our Treaty with Yugoslavia on the basis of which
                                <gloss target="#t_MFN1">m.f.n.</gloss> treatment is extended, and he
                            was not sure what this meant. I told him my impression was that the
                            wording of the Trade Act made it incumbent upon him only to give notice
                            “as soon as practicable” of our intention to terminate operation of the
                            Treaty, and that one year would have to elapse, after such notice was
                            given, before the Treaty would cease to be in effect. He asked me to see
                            to it that he was put right about it in case my understanding was not
                            correct.</p>
                        <p>I gave it to him as my opinion that if the new Congress was in any way
                            seized of the question of revoking the <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >m.f.n.</gloss> denial, or if this was the subject of active
                            consideration by any Congressional committee, he would be justified in
                            finding that this was not a “practicable” moment for giving notice of
                            the termination of the Treaty.</p>
                        <p>I believe the President understood, and concurred in, my view that while
                            a statement by him in press conference would, of course, be helpful in
                            steadying the reaction of the Yugoslavs, the latter cannot be expected
                            to be fully reassured until it becomes clear that favorable action is to
                            be taken by the Congress; and that in the meantime no major initiative
                            by us, designed either to deflect the Yugoslav President from his
                            present political course or to achieve a better understanding in
                            American public opinion of the Yugoslav situation and the requirements
                            of a constructive American policy there, could be expected to be
                            useful.</p>

                            to what this means from the standpoint of our relations with
                            Yugoslavia.</p>
                        <p>It is clear that the President, for reasons we must all respect, is not
                            disposed to make a major head-on issue with the Congress of <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">m.f.n.</gloss> for Yugoslavia. A reply to a press
                            question will be helpful, but there is no reason to hope that this alone
                            will serve to deflect <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> in any
                            appreciable degree from the line of independent alignment with Moscow,
                            on which he is embarked. At the best, we face five or six months of
                            uncertainty as to whether the <gloss target="#t_MFN1">m.f.n.</gloss>
                            denial will or will not be rescinded. During this period, we can
                            undertake no major initiatives. We cannot undertake a wide domestic
                            program to improve U.S. opinion with regard to Yugoslavia, for <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> is apt to trip us up at any time
                            with new unfriendly gestures or statements which appear to belie our
                            thesis. We cannot, on the other hand, take a hard line towards <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> to any good effect; for its impact
                            on the Yugoslav public would be confused by the <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >m.f.n.</gloss> issue, and it could easily come to be regarded here
                            as inconsistent with the effort to get the <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >m.f.n.</gloss> denial rescinded.</p>
                        <p>This spells, as I see it, a further period of enforced inactivity on our
                            part. It is very likely that in the course of this period our relations
                            with Yugoslavia—and indeed the latter’s relations with the West in
                            general—will continue to deteriorate. <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName>’s public support of Soviet positions may now be
                            expected to be intensified, and this will continue to give offense here
                            insofar as it becomes known to our public. There may very well also be
                            increased pressures against our personal contacts in Belgrade,
                            harassment of our reading-rooms and other <gloss target="#t_USIS1"
                                >USIS</gloss> facilities, and a general effort to break up the
                            positions and the influence we have won over the course of the years in
                            Yugoslavia. I hope it is understood here that there will be very little
                            we can do, in the present circumstances, to resist these attacks.</p>
                        <p>What has been at stake in our relations with Yugoslavia in recent years
                            has been the question whether a socialist country which had rendered <pb
                                n="329" xml:id="pg_329" facs="0351"/>itself independent of Moscow’s
                            control might be persuaded that it could have, on the basis of
                            nonalignment, a relation with the West which offered possibilities
                            greater than those of a renewed association with the bloc. It was
                            important for us to document the positive answer to this question, not
                            only for its meaning to Yugoslavia itself, but also for the lesson it
                            would carry to other countries of the communist bloc, or to countries
                            which might contemplate joining it.</p>
                        <p>Up to 1960, we were doing quite well in this effort. The overwhelming
                            majority of the Yugoslav people, and I think the preponderant portion
                            even of the party and governmental leaders, were persuaded of the
                            desirability of maintaining a relationship with the West at least as
                            good as that with the East. We were, in fact, close to complete success
                            except in the case of <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> himself
                            and a few of his associates; and there was reason to hope that it would
                            be only a short time before <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>
                            would be obliged, by age and infirmity, to yield to younger people who
                            had a more realistic concept of Yugoslavia’s true interest.</p>
                        <p>These trends of Yugoslav opinion notwithstanding, <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> has been making a determined
                            effort, ever since mid-1960, to lead his country back to a position
                            which would be one not of disciplinary subordination to Moscow, but of
                            such close intimacy and partnership with it that the implications would
                            be scarcely more favorable from our standpoint. The immediate impulse to
                            this effort came, no doubt, from the growing rift between Moscow, on the
                            one hand, and Communist China and Albania on the other, which appeared
                            to <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> to offer favorable
                            possibilities for accommodation with Moscow on his own terms.
                            Ideological prejudice, and a decline in the need for Western aid also
                            played a part. More recently, the tendency has been greatly stimulated
                            by the advanced stage of the Soviet-Chinese conflict, by <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s embitterment over the <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">m.f.n.</gloss> action and other developments in
                            Western policies, and by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s clever and receptive treatment of him
                            personally.</p>
                        <p>We do not know how successful <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>
                            will be in this effort. It is widely unpopular in his entourage, as well
                            as with the Yugoslav public at large. Liberal practices and approaches
                            have now taken such root in Yugoslavia that it will not be easy to do
                            away with them. The effort to find a place for Yugoslavia as an <hi
                                rend="italic">independent</hi> entity within the moral and political
                            framework of the bloc will raise, furthermore, difficult problems of
                            precedence for <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. For
                            these reasons, <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s undertaking
                            will no doubt encounter many difficulties. It may even have serious
                            repercussions on the unity of the Yugoslav state. In any case, what
                            emerges from the effort is not apt to be entirely what <persName

                        <p>I am not, therefore, predicting certain disaster, in the sense of a total
                            and final return of Yugoslavia to the bloc. But there are three points
                            about which we ought all to be clear at this stage: <list>

                                    It holds, in fact, real dangers for us. Yugoslavia’s geographic
                                    position is a highly strategic one. Any return of Soviet
                                    military influence or activity to this area would represent a
                                    basic deterioration of the strategic situation of the <gloss

                                    affect Yugoslavia’s relations with Italy, Greece and Austria. If
                                    Yugoslavia, furthermore, after fifteen years of experimentation
                                    with liberalization and free association with the West, decides
                                    nevertheless to sacrifice her Western ties in favor of a close
                                    and, in the political sense exclusive, association with the
                                    bloc, this is bound to have an important effect on other bloc
                                    countries, discouraging any tendencies there towards greater
                                    independence, lending strength to Moscow’s position that there
                                    is no acceptable place for a socialist country between the
                                    Western and Eastern political worlds.</item>

                                    may be in his effort to carry Yugoslavia to a position of
                                    independent association with the bloc, the very effort is bound
                                    to take place at the expense of Yugoslavia’s relations with the
                                    West, generally, and particularly with us. This represents for
                                    us a loss in itself. We have a stake in our relations with that
                                    country measured by the investment of more than two billion
                                    dollars in the various aid programs and—more important still—the
                                    effective effort, over the course of the years, of a great many
                                    able and devoted people. Whether <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                        >Tito</persName> succeeds or does not succeed with what he

                                    the exchange programs, the entire progress made in opening up
                                    Yugoslavia to Western influences—are apt to become a casualty to

                                    attitudes of the West Germans and the Common Market deprives the
                                    Yugoslavs of any favorable prospects in the development of their
                                    economic and political relations with the West. This
                                    predetermines, in a manner highly unfavorable to the West, the
                                    background situation in the face of which the differences of
                                    policy as between <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> and
                                    much of the hierarchy have to be resolved and Yugoslavia’s
                                    choices arrived at. It can only be said that if, in present
                                    circumstances, the Yugoslavs stop short of a complete
                                    realignment with the bloc, this will be due almost solely to
                                    internal forces of resistance within Yugoslav society (greatly
                                    stimulated and strengthened to be sure by our efforts in
                                    previous years) and not to any favorable immediate prospects in
                                    Western-Yugoslav relations. If Yugoslavia remains nonaligned in
                                    these present circumstances, I am afraid it will be largely in
                                    spite of, rather than because <pb n="331" xml:id="pg_331"

                        <p>I would make these observations because to remain inactive in these
                            circumstances represents a certain historic responsibility. I do not
                            mean to plead here for the alteration of our stance; I have made my
                            recommendations from Belgrade and, as far as I am concerned, they stand.
                            I do wish to make sure, before returning for this further period of
                            service as Ambassador in Yugoslavia, that there is a full awareness on

                                    (Russian term he used means literally “unengaged”) no longer was
                                    accurate as description of Yugoslav position; Yugoslavia was
                                    “committed” to support peace-loving forces everywhere; it was
                                    inaccurate to say she was not committed.</item>

                                    lengthy argument, in recent Berlin speech, against
                                    identification of Warsaw Pact with various free world pacts, by
                                    “leaders of certain countries which call themselves unengaged,”

                                <item><persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> spoke disparagingly
                                    of the Warsaw Pact as no longer fitted to modern conditions. He
                                    expressed hope that it would be soon possible to dispense with

                                    vis-à-vis Moscow, he replied by voicing opinion that satellite
                                    countries were themselves rapidly losing quality of dependence
                                    on Moscow and were beginning to show real independence of policy
                                    in many respects (please note my 743,<note n="2"

                                <item><persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> spoke at length
                                    about US aid. He said (as in Skoplje speech last year) that
                                    Yugoslavs had felt themselves entitled to material aid on a
                                    major scale from other allies as consequence of their great
                                    material and human losses in the war; that they had been greatly
                                    disappointed in what they got out of Germany by way of
                                    reparations; that they had therefore regarded our aid as
                                    something they were really entitled to; and that they were weary
                                    of constant reproaches of ingratitude on our part. They were
                                    anxious to dispense with our aid. He himself had given orders
                                    two years ago that they were to free themselves from it as
                                    rapidly as possible. He hoped they would not have to ask for any
                                    further wheat under PL 480; from now on they expected to buy it
                                    in normal fashion. Once they were no longer taking aid from us,
                                    there could be no further <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334"

                                <item>He entered into usual “plaidoyer” about <persName
                                        corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s love of peace and
                                    objected violently when I pointed out that <persName

                                    >Khrushchev</persName>’s side in intra-Bloc differences,
                                        <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> stated outright
                                    what we have long suspected was his position, namely: that he
                                    did not feel, in view of importance of what was at stake, that
                                    they could afford to be unduly influenced by reactions of
                                    Western opinion in rendering such support.</item>
                                <label>7.</label>
                                <item>He went over usual list of grievances against Western policy:
                                    Notably <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>, unprohibited
                                    Ustashi activities, coldness of Germans and Common Market to
                                    Yugoslav trade requirements (characteristically, he even
                                    included our unwillingness to give further aid, although a
                                    moment later he was saying they did not want it). He said
                                    Yugoslavs were obliged to strengthen economic relations with the
                                    East because we were undependable. He never knew at what point
                                    they would get hit by some whim of the Congress. In addition to
                                    going over usual explanations about <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                        >MFN</gloss>, I told him that in other circumstances by
                                    Government might have felt itself in a position to make major
                                    effort to correct misunderstandings and prejudices about
                                    Yugoslavia in American opinion but that in light of uncertainty
                                    concerning Yugoslavia’s future relations with Soviet Union it
                                    was difficult for us to take such responsibility. Mentioned
                                    particularly in this connection <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                        >Khrushchev</persName>’s forthcoming visit. He reacted
                                    strongly to this last, denying we had anything to fear; but when
                                    I reiterated that we could not afford to encourage our public to
                                    believe things which might be changed in near future, he
                                    replied, significantly, with suggestion we might limit ourselves
                                    to trying to give them a true picture of situation as of

                        <p>In November 1962, a group of Croatian nationalists attacked the Yugoslav
                            Trade Mission office in Bad Godesberg, firebombing the office suite.
                            Yugoslavia, although without diplomatic representation in the Federal
                            Republic, launched a strong protest of German handling of the incident.
                            On March 12, 1963, the Federal Republic dissolved the Croat organization
                            “Brotherhood of the Cross” as the agency responsible for the attack.
                            Twenty-five Croats were tried and convicted for roles in the attack in
                            June 1964.</p>
                        <p>Department appreciated Yugoslav consideration informing this Government
                            in advance Yugoslav action. Yugoslav foreign policy, including policy
                            toward Germany, is of course for Yugos to determine. Decisions, however,
                            of such great importance and fraught with such dangers that we feel
                            obliged as friend Yugoslavia most earnestly to urge reconsideration.</p>
                        <p>We recognize that Yugoslavia acting out of disappointment and frustration
                            that its complaints against Germany have not yet been answered. Would
                            hope however Yugoslavs would weigh carefully whether a policy of
                            retaliation would contribute better results and whether Yugoslav
                            interests in long term served by such policy. We feel certain Yugoslav
                            interests would not be so served. On contrary, retaliatory policy
                            regardless of true motives would be widely interpreted abroad as related
                            primarily to Yugo-Soviet rapprochement and calculated serve Soviet
                            objectives. Yugoslav position in US, in West and indeed in non-aligned
                            world would suffer. And the greatest danger of all is that Yugoslav
                            retaliatory policy can only serve to set in motion a series of actions
                            and counteractions from which retreat may be difficult or
                            impossible.</p>

                            forums. US for example took lead in organizing financial <pb n="336"

                            exchange reform. US was instrumental in facilitating Yugo presence in

                            problems in concrete terms. <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> has
                            agreed do so. US has argued with <gloss target="#t_FEDREP1"
                                >FedRep</gloss> on behalf Yugoslavia and not without results. We
                            have taken these measures despite our awareness not only of Yugoslav
                            complaints against Germany but also of German dissatisfaction certain
                            Yugoslav policies. We are prepared to continue our efforts to facilitate
                            and improve Yugoslavia’s relations with <gloss target="#t_FEDREP1"
                                >FedRep</gloss> as well as with <gloss target="#t_OECD1"
                                >OECD</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. Yugoslavia
                            cannot suppose however that the US could continue its efforts in the
                            face of a new Yugoslav policy which certain to be interpreted in West
                            not so much the result of aggrieved Yugoslav feelings toward Germany but
                            directed against interests West.</p>

                                    directed to highly developed or to underdeveloped republics, it
                                    also raises basic political issue of dictatorial centralization
                                    versus liberal decentralization in political sense, and thus
                                    produces growing bitterness and divergence between hard-line
                                    Communists on one side and liberal Marxists on other. This
                                    conflict is probably intensified by everyone’s awareness of

                                    higher than at any point since World War II. So acute is this
                                    situation that Slovene ComParty finds itself faced which choice
                                    between identifying with Slovene national feeling or losing most

                                    ways, he favors old-fashioned Communist approaches, but on vital
                                    issue of investment policy, his mind appears to be moving
                                    towards concept which would give communes and enterprises wide

                                    investment capital within country. This would, if realized,
                                    constitute important shift of Yugo economy in Western

                                    Yugoslavia, he said, could not as socialist country show itself

                                    me that Yugoslavia will not enter into any military pacts with
                                    anyone. (Whether this would preclude less formal arrangements of
                                    military collaboration, is another question. His silence on this
                                    point did not reassure me.) He professed himself well aware of
                                    dangers implicit for Yugoslavia in any composition of
                                    Chinese-Soviet differences. He did not know what would happen in
                                    such an event; Yugoslavia would in any case not allow herself
                                    “to be put into circulation like a coin.”</item>

                                        >Tito</persName> has unquestionably been stung personally by
                                    anti-Yugoslav outbursts in our public discussion, by what he
                                    considers our government’s general complacency in face of
                                    boycott movements and Yugoslav emigre activities, and by

                                        >Kennedy</persName>’s position vis-à-vis public opinion. He
                                    knew, he said, that there were things President was not in
                                    position to say, and that President could not give guarantees to
                                    US public for Yugoslav behavior. He only wished that President
                                    would also show understanding of his own problems as a

                                    unimportant ways. I have impression, however, that behind him
                                    there are certain other highly placed figures who are even more
                                    hostile to good relations with us and are doubly dangerous
                                    because they act anonymously, are hard to identify, and cannot
                                    be led into open and responsible discussion on
                                    government-to-government level.</item>

                        <p>I urge that before finally acting on the proposed determination
                            permitting military sales to Yugoslavia under section 620 (f),<note

                            explicitly in our own thinking to the potential effect on the foreign
                            aid legislation now before Congress and to the request of the President
                            for restoration of the <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> clause to
                            Poland and Yugoslavia.</p>
                        <p>I recognize that the pending military sale to Yugoslavia is only for
                            spare parts in connection with previous sales to that country, and the
                            precedent is well established in both a legal and political sense. At
                            the <pb n="340" xml:id="pg_340" facs="0362"/>same time, the action could
                            trigger serious Congressional repercussions.</p>
                        <p>The point will almost certainly be made by Congressional critics that if
                            the Administration is not willing to make the necessary finding under
                            the 1962 authorization bill that the extension of foreign aid to
                            Yugoslavia is in our national interest, how can we nevertheless justify
                            the delivery of additional military supplies at this time to the
                            Yugoslavs? The military sale, of course, is not subject to the provision
                            requiring the finding necessary before aid can be extended—but most
                            members of Congress will consider that this fact is an idle legalism,
                            and that if we are not ready to provide the necessary finding to justify
                            “soft” aid, we can hardly justify, as a matter of policy, further
                            military assistance. As a political matter, it seems to me to be dubious
                            to refuse to take the political heat of making a finding on foreign
                            assistance while being willing to take the much greater heat likely in
                            connection with the military sale.</p>
                        <p>The mere fact of extending more military hardware for Yugoslavia will be
                            used by opponents of foreign aid as an added excuse to urge that aid of
                            any kind to communist countries be prohibited in the aid bill this year.
                            The attendant stir will also be used to oppose restoration of <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> to Yugoslavia.</p>
                        <p>I urge that if all possible the pending military sale be delayed until
                            next October after Congress has adjourned.</p>
                        <p>More fundamentally, I believe that the Administration needs to pull
                            together a more coherent aid policy towards Yugoslavia. We apparently
                            are going to provide military assistance but not make the finding
                            necessary to make “soft” assistance. I would think that underlying
                            political and economic objectives toward that country would require more
                            consistency and coherence as among these various types of aid. Certainly
                            our critics in Congress will club us over these contributions.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MV2">Micunovic</persName> thanked the
                            President for the early appointment. He reported to the President that
                            during his consultation in Belgrade from March 13 to April 14 he had met
                            with President <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> and other
                            leaders of the Yugoslav Government, and had brought with him to
                            Washington a personal message from <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName> to the President. The Ambassador pointed out that
                            the Serbo-Croatian text of the letter was the original and that the
                            English translation accompanying it should be considered an unofficial
                            translation.</p>
                        <p>The President read the message from <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName>, thanked the Ambassador and said he would respond
                            to the letter. He expressed his appreciation for <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s remarks. The President said we
                            are going ahead with our efforts to amend the most-favored-nation
                            legislation [Section 231 of the Trade Expansion Act]<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d156fn1">All brackets in the source text.</note> but noted
                            that the Ambassador was aware of the legislative difficulties. Our
                            efforts to amend the legislation offers an opportunity for some members
                            of Congress to be unhelpful. We will know later what our legislative
                            chances are.</p>
                        <p>The President also said he was gratified that on the basis of <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s trip to the Soviet Union the
                            Yugoslav President feels that the Soviet leadership wants peace. The
                            President pointed out that we want peace too. We are moving ahead on
                            these matters. We are working hard on the non-diffusion of atomic
                            weapons, for example, and the situation is more normal in the
                            Caribbean.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MV2"
                                >Micunovic</persName> for his opinion on the possibilities for a
                            resolution of the Sino-Soviet dispute. How would such a resolution
                            affect Yugoslavia?</p>
                        <pb n="342" xml:id="pg_342" facs="0364"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador replied that it is difficult to see what realistic
                            possibilities there are for a resolution of Sino-Soviet difficulties.
                            Efforts have been made to ease Sino-Soviet tension and some alleviation
                            is possible, but the basic differences will remain. The Ambassador also
                            agreed with the President that it was difficult to see how good
                            relations could exist on all sides of the Sino-Soviet-Yugoslav
                            triangle.</p>
                        <p>The President asked if <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> would
                            visit Mexico and the Ambassador replied in the affirmative. The
                            Ambassador said invitations had been received also from Brazil, Bolivia,
                            and Chile and that it is expected that <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName> will visit all of these countries in the autumn.
                            The Ambassador noted that in the Yugoslav view the visit of the Mexican
                            President was very successful. The Yugoslavs were very pleased.</p>
                        <p>The President asked the Ambassador for his assessment of current
                            difficulties within the USSR, noting that although <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> had been there, his visit was
                            several months ago. The Ambassador replied by noting that for quite a
                            number of years the Yugoslavs had attempted to improve their relations
                            with the USSR on the basis of the Yugoslav policy of independence and
                            non-alignment. The Ambassador had tried to further these Yugoslav
                            efforts when several years ago he was his country’s ambassador in
                            Moscow, but he had not been successful. However, significant changes
                            have taken place in the USSR. There is evolution everywhere, and the
                            evolutionary developments in the Soviet Union made it possible for
                                <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s recent visit to be
                            successful. But as a result of these changes in the Soviet Union the
                            Sino-Soviet conflict has grown as well. Yugoslavia as a socialist
                            country is vitally interested in these developments and wishes to
                            support progressive evolutionary tendencies everywhere—the Yugoslavs
                            support negotiated settlements on the basis of mutual concessions and
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>In that respect Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s speech of 12 December, delivered in the
                            presence of President <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>, went
                            as far as the Soviets had ever gone before in advocating these
                            progressive evolutionary tendencies. The Ambassador expressed his
                            understanding, therefore, of President <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName>’s sincere belief that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> is interested in peace and negotiated
                            settlements. At the moment <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s words have become “harder”, but his intent
                            remains the same as during <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s
                            visit.</p>
                        <p>The President asked the Ambassador for his view on the pressures on
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> from Stalinists
                            and others within the Kremlin.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador saw the pressures on <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> as falling into two categories. First, there
                            is <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s lack of success
                            in achieving significant accomplishments vis-à-vis the West. Second,
                            Communist Chinese positions have been strengthened as a result of the
                            cold war. In the absence of success on either of these fronts the
                            pressure on <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is
                            great.</p>
                        <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0365"/>
                        <p>There was great hope in Yugoslavia that when <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> accepted the principle of on-site inspection
                            that an agreement between the Soviets and the US would follow. There had
                            been hope also that after the Soviet [rocket] withdrawal from Cuba there
                            would be some lessening of Cuban problems in and outside the US. The
                            Yugoslavs had hoped that some gains for <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> on the second front [vis-à-vis the Chinese]
                            would occur. There had been some disappointment in Yugoslavia that these
                            positive developments had not produced more significant results.</p>
                        <p>The President concurred that there had been no spectacular agreements. On
                            the other hand we have a situation which is not war, which is less
                            tense, and which is not as dangerous as last fall or during the fall of
                            1961. The very lack of greater danger is a form of success. Agreements
                            themselves are not always so satisfactory. We have an agreement on Laos
                            but we do not have a satisfactory situation there.</p>
                        <p>The President assured the Ambassador again that he would respond to
                                <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>, and he expressed a
                            desire to see good relations with Yugoslavia. The President said good
                            relations between the US and Yugoslavia contribute to stability in that
                            area, and he hoped that Yugoslav influence in other areas such as Africa
                            and the Middle East will be in the right direction. The President
                            expressed the hope that our bilateral problems, in particular <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> and sales of military spare parts, will
                            be resolved. He said he appreciated President <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName>’s letter, and also the courtesies the Yugoslavs
                            have extended to our Ambassador in Belgrade.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MV2">Micunovic</persName> associated
                            himself with the President’s hope for a solution to our particular
                            problems, and said that beyond this goal, the Yugoslavs also hoped to
                            build a firm basis for a continued expansion of good relations with the
                            US. He wished to assure the President, in closing the discussion, that
                            Yugoslav policies would remain non-aligned and independent, as stressed
                            in President <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s letter.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then informed the President that he had been instructed to
                            invite Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> to visit
                            Yugoslavia and hoped that it was not inappropriate to so inform the
                            President before he saw the Secretary tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed his confidence that the Secretary of State would
                            be pleased to receive an invitation and a visit would be a good
                            thing.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: I avail myself of the
                                opportunity offered to me by the return of our Ambassador, Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MV2">Veljko Micunovic</persName>, to
                                Washington, in order to address you this message and to set forth my
                                views on certain current aspects of our mutual relations, in the
                                belief that this can be beneficial to future relations between our
                                two countries.</p>
                            <p>Certain difficulties have arisen in our relations in the past year
                                and have caused concern to the Yugoslav Government. All the more so
                                as the relations between Yugoslavia and the United States were
                                acquiring the character of an even more positive tradition and,
                                within this context, were also providing an encouraging example of
                                successful co-existence and friendly co-operation among countries
                                with different social and political systems. In our view, this
                                positive tradition was built by mutual efforts and in the mutual
                                interest over a number of years and it successfully weathered the
                                periods when the general pattern of international relations was not
                                always the most propitious. We are convinced, for our part, that
                                there exist both a need and conditions for a further successful
                                development of such relations.</p>
                            <p>This view of ours is based on the principles by which the foreign
                                policy of Yugoslavia is guided. The post-war period and the
                                experiences gained by the peoples and the Government of Yugoslavia
                                during this time have strengthened our belief that the policy best
                                suited to our country is that of co-operation with all States on the
                                basis of independence, equal rights and non-interference in internal
                                affairs and mutual respect. We are convinced that our independent
                                and non-aligned policy has proved to be not only the best suited to
                                our national interests but Yugoslavia has thus also done its utmost
                                to promote general international cooperation, peace and progress in
                                the world. If we glance today at the rather long and arduous road
                                that we have traversed during this period and at the results we have
                                achieved, we have sufficient reason for remaining firmly convinced
                                as to the correctness of such a policy.</p>
                            <p>Last year’s new Trade Act, which deprived Yugoslavia of the
                                most-favoured-nation treatment, existing between our two countries
                                for almost a century, has in our view opened the way, in the United
                                States, to the aforementioned difficulties. This has been also
                                followed by other negative manifestations resulting, in one way or
                                another, in a further <pb n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0367"
                                />narrowing of the framework of mutual co-operation. At certain
                                moments, in the past, uncertainty concerning Yugoslavia’s future
                                policy has been expressed by the American side. Here in Yugoslavia,
                                too, a similar feeling of uncertainty has appeared as to the future
                                policy of the United States towards us. My associates and I,
                                departing from the belief that occurrences harmful to the interests
                                of the two countries and contrary to the intentions of both
                                Governments were involved, have endeavoured not to allow matters to
                                be dramatised as often happens under similar circumstances.</p>
                            <p>I am certain, Mr. President, that it is in the interest of Yugoslavia
                                and, I believe, also in the interest of the United States that the
                                Governments of our countries should do all that is indispensable in
                                order to check this process of weakening and deterioration of our
                                relations, to prevent the further weakening of what has been
                                achieved by our common efforts in the course of the past years. The
                                peoples and the Government of Yugoslavia have appreciated every
                                effort exerted by your Government to that end. I have learnt with
                                particular pleasure the news of the step that you personally
                                undertook recently in the United States Congress with a view to
                                restoring normal terms of trade between Yugoslavia and the United
                                States. We believe that the results of your positive initiative will
                                not only favourably affect further relations between our countries
                                in the field of trade but also that the whole matter has a broader
                                political significance. I feel, as I have already told your
                                Ambassador Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KGF1">George F.
                                    Kennan</persName> on several occasions, that it is possible to
                                further expand our economic relations on a commercial and business
                                basis and that these relations will be placed, in this way, on more
                                realistic and stable foundations.</p>
                            <p>In my opinion a great part of difficulties in co-operation among
                                States, especially among those holding different views on major
                                international problems, is also due to insufficient mutual
                                acquaintance and understanding. Thus, for instance, we are under the
                                impression that Yugoslavia’s policy concerning some current issues
                                is not always correctly understood in your country and that some
                                people interpret it sometimes as being directed against the United
                                States. I do not wish to exclude that in our country, too, there is
                                sometimes a similar lack of sufficient understanding.</p>
                            <p>I wish to point out that our views of principle on these and similar
                                questions proceed from the assumption that our relations with
                                individual countries should not develop to the detriment of
                                relations with third countries, as this would directly undermine the
                                foundations on which the general principles of international
                                co-operation should be based. On the contrary, we are convinced that
                                the improvement of our relations with an ever broader circle of
                                countries can only contribute to the strengthening of international
                                understanding and co-operation in general. <pb n="346"
                                    xml:id="pg_346" facs="0368"/>We feel that the improvement of our
                                relations with the USSR and the majority of socialist countries,
                                which has taken place recently, serves the same end. I can tell you,
                                Mr. President, that I have convinced myself, on the occasion of my
                                last visit to the Soviet Union also, that the Soviet leadership and
                                the Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">N.S.
                                    Khrushchev</persName> are profoundly interested in the
                                preservation of world peace and that they wish to pursue a policy of
                                negotiations and peaceful co-existence. In our opinion all this
                                deserves special attention, especially at a time when various
                                efforts—which are being exerted in the world with a view to easing
                                international tensions and in which the activities and relations
                                between your and the Soviet Government play such an important
                                role—are, it seems to me, nevertheless producing some initial
                                positive results.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, Mr. President, I wish to emphasise our belief that the
                                obstacles which have made their appearance in the relations between
                                our two countries will be overcome by our mutual endeavours and that
                                our relations, placed on a sound and realistic basis, can and will
                                develop to the mutual benefit and to the benefit of international
                                co-operation and world peace.</p>
                            <p>Wishing you, Mr. President, and the people of the United States all
                                the best, I beg you to accept the assurances of my high
                                consideration.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>I was very pleased to have your message of April 7 from Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MV2">Micunovic</persName>.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d159fn1">Attachment to <ref target="#d156">Document

                        <p>I too have been concerned by the difficulties which have arisen over the
                            past year and a half, and particularly by the fact that these problems
                            were sharpened to some extent by a lack of understanding on both sides.
                            It is true that in addition to misunderstandings there have been some
                            real concerns among my countrymen that the legitimate security interests
                            and the deeply peaceful purposes of the United States might not be fully
                            recognized in Yugoslavia. We think that mutual recognition of such
                            interests and purposes is of high importance in our relations.</p>
                        <p>One thing which has been most helpful in improving the levels of
                            understanding has been the work of the very able representatives of <pb
                                n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0371"/>your country here in
                            Washington. We greatly appreciate the efforts you and they have made to
                            remove some of the misunderstandings. For our part, I know that
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KGF1">Kennan</persName> and his staff
                            have consistently and constantly pursued these same goals in
                            Belgrade.</p>
                        <p>I share your belief that through efforts on both sides, we can and will
                            succeed in removing many of the difficulties that have arisen. It
                            remains my objective to maintain and improve our relations. My recent
                            request to the Congress to amend the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, so
                            that the United States will be able to continue to extend <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> benefits to Yugoslavia, reflects my
                            confidence in our ability to eliminate many of the problems that have
                            arisen and to strengthen the friendship and cooperation between our two
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>I carefully noted your comment to the effect that the Soviet leadership
                            is profoundly interested in peace and the policy of negotiated
                            understandings. I am sure you are aware that the United States has
                            consistently sought peaceful solutions of international problems through
                            negotiation. However, where the security of the nation and the peace of
                            the world are at stake, it is important that good will and peaceful
                            intentions be reinforced with workable agreements on basic outstanding
                            issues, equitably arrived at.</p>
                        <p>Let me emphasize again that the goals of this Government in our relations
                            with Yugoslavia remain constant. We want to cooperate in every
                            appropriate way. We respect Yugoslavia’s unaligned role and your belief
                            in the importance of maintaining national independence and sovereignty.
                            It is my desire and hope that in our unflagging effort toward
                            international cooperation and the achievement of world peace, we may
                            have the full support of Yugoslavia and that our relations may be
                            maintained on the sound and realistic footing which has generally served
                            our countries well.</p>

                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName>. Also present
                            were Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Nikezic</persName>,
                            Assistant Secretary Lekic and Director Petric. Meeting lasted one hour
                            and half.</p>
                        <p>After agreement discuss bilateral and then broader international issues,
                            Secretary began by stating US Government had serious desire steadily
                            improve our relations with Yugoslav Government. While recognizing there
                            are and will continue to be differences in points of view some
                            questions, it was our hope that each side would work toward resolving
                            them. Immediate problem of <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> was
                            before Congress and it was our hope that discussion there would help
                            clarify our relations. Secretary said he could not give any clear
                            assurances at this time what Congress would do but President and he had
                            talked with congressional leaders and there was reason to expect that
                            some who had been unhelpful in past might be silent this year. He
                            pointed out we had not carried out the provision in the Trade Act Law
                            withdrawing <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> and would not as long as
                            Congress has the matter under consideration. Secretary said it would
                            assist us in handling matter on Washington scene if matter of public
                            statements and exchanges between governments could be avoided.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> replied he did not have
                            much comment now; history of matter well known; Yugoslavs regarded it as
                            an important problem not because of economic substance but because it
                            was a political problem which until solved threatens the whole fabric of
                            our relations. He knew it was not an act by US Government and recognized
                            difficulties in correcting matter. Yugoslavs were encouraged by
                            information they had received that difficulties might be less than
                            before, which they attributed to efforts of most authoritative members
                            US Government. Expressed optimism that matter was on way to be solved.
                            Pointed out that Yugoslavs had refrained from too negatively presenting
                            matter before Yugoslav public opinion. They had congressional problem
                            much in mind and would continue to show restraint in hope problem can be
                            solved.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> then raised question of
                            Yugoslav emigre activities in US noting that US had already taken some
                            measure to ameliorate situation. Yugoslavs were not asking for an unreal
                            maximum and recognized that under American law the US restricted as to
                            what could be done. However, Yugoslavs hope that most extreme actions
                            can be discouraged in <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0373"/>order
                            that relations not be affected in a negative manner. Solution of this
                            problem could only help both sides.</p>
                        <p>Secretary commented he aware of incidents in past for which we had
                            expressed regrets. We would continue carefully follow this matter but
                            there was limit to what we can do not only because of constitutional
                            provisions but because US was nation of emigres. Within range of free
                            speech and freedom of press, we will take action to prevent anything
                            harmful to Yugoslav officials or property or which could injure
                            relations between two countries.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> then raised question sales
                            military spare parts. Pointed out there had already been failure to meet
                            certain contractual obligations and this created difficulty for normal
                            function Yugoslav Army. Secretary replied he was familiar with this
                            problem and hoped a solution can be found. Pointed out that this
                            solution for US has two points: the technical legal point under the law
                            of certain findings which the President must make but it was also a
                            political matter as we must consult with congressional leaders and thus
                            it has some political connection with problem <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >MFN</gloss>. Promised to take up question when he returned
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>Discussion then turned to international issue with Secretary remarking
                            that we were trying to reach agreement on one of two points with Soviet
                            Union though we don’t see any possibility of a broad detente. Secretary
                            cited outer space, recent message to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> from Macmillan and President on nuclear test
                            ban, non proliferation and Berlin.<note n="1" xml:id="d160fn1">Dated
                                April 15; for text, see <ref target="frus1961-63v06#d93">vol. VI,
                                    Document 93</ref>.</note> With regard to nuclear test ban
                            expressed belief that number of inspections should not be allowed to
                            stand in way of achieving agreement. Until we could obtain agreement on
                            character of inspections it relatively meaningless to discuss number.
                            Believed this could be worked out so that espionage would not come into
                            question. Described dangers of armaments race and thought agreement on
                            ban still in national interest of three countries. Secretary stated we
                            had been disappointed that temperature of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s interest in nuclear test ban seemed to have
                            fallen since last December.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> noted Yugoslavs were not so
                            well qualified to talk about this question. Said they were not enough
                            acquainted with latest proposal to have definite opinion. Yugoslavs
                            appreciated dangers in sense Secretary spoke about arms race and danger
                            of other nations arming themselves with nuclear weapons. Yugoslavs had
                            impression that Western side insisted too much on inspection and USSR
                            too much on espionage.</p>
                        <p>They were hopeful two sides could find basis for agreement but had
                            impression both sides seemed to be more rigid than warranted. Yugoslavs
                                <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0374"/>unable judge Secretary’s
                            estimate Soviets had cooled off on test ban treaty.</p>
                        <p>After brief general discussion disarmament Secretary brought up question
                            of Cuba pointing out potential dangers as long as Soviet forces present
                            on island. Observed there were two non-negotiable points, i.e., military
                            and political connection of Cuba with Moscow, and illegal intrusion of
                            Cuba into affairs of other LA countries. Reviewed history of Castro
                            movement and commented Castro appeared to have abandoned his original
                            commitments and turned revolution into something else. We did not oppose
                            Castro just for historical reasons but problem related to present
                            security needs. So long as Soviet troops are there Cuba will continue to
                            be a difficult question.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> expressed recognition
                            importance US attached to Cuban question and as unresolved question it
                            constituted threat to peace not only in that region but to world.
                            Yugoslavs considered real social revolution had taken place in Cuba and
                            that the regime there represents basic aspirations of Cuban people.
                            Recognized this viewpoint different from Secretary’s. Pointed out that
                            even before Soviet troops or arms were introduced into Cuba differences
                            between US and Cuba were great. Asked if modus vivendi could not be
                            found which might then eventually lead to a solution.</p>
                        <p>Secretary replied though we did not know too much about attitude and
                            thinking present Cuban regime, we knew that there were those who
                            believed Cuba should have close ties with Soviet Union while others
                            believed that ties should be with Peiping. What US did not find were
                            those who want reconciliation with the other LA countries. Hence the
                            Secretary was not hopeful of a solution particularly in the light of two
                            non-negotiable points he had mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KGF1">Kennan</persName> pointed out US
                            had never made an issue of nationalized properties in Cuba and that it
                            was not question of social revolution but rather a question of Cuban
                            attitude toward the US and toward their responsibilities to other
                            countries in Western hemisphere. Secretary noted 1959 Castro visit to US
                            and our attempt to establish good relations. However, by May 1960 it was
                            evident Castro rejected all overtures and a great many of Castro’s old
                            associates in revolutionary movement had abandoned him. Cuba was a
                            highly exposed nerve to the American people and the Yugoslavs should
                            know that last October was a unique moment on two counts, i.e., for the
                            first time US and Soviet forces confronted each other and for the first
                            time their leaders faced the possibility of general nuclear war.
                            Emphasized this could not help but affect all our relationships until
                            problem was solved.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PK1">Popovic</persName> said Yugos properly
                            appraised dangers in this situation. Noted that US making efforts calm
                            situation which had not been accepted by “certain circles” in US.
                            Secretary replied it was true President <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353"
                                facs="0375"/>was trying to keep country calm and realistic on these
                            matters but this was not easy on issue which struck so deep in American
                            opinion. Emphasized that Yugoslavs should understand depth of feeling in
                            US on Cuban question.</p>
                        <p>Discussion ended with the brief description at request of <persName

                        <p>1583. Paris for <gloss target="#t_USRO1">USRO</gloss>. We believe that
                            dominant mood of <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> and leading
                            advisors in confrontation with problems of Yugoslavia’s international
                            position must today be one of much uncertainty, sensitivity, and
                            indecision. <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s Moscow visit
                            last December, and reflection it found in his subsequent statements,
                            caused some consternation and alarm within party and population, where
                            it was feared he had been swept by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s charm, by deference of Soviet officialdom,
                            and by his own strong desire to influence outcome of bloc differences,
                            into sacrificing relations with unaligned group and with West and thus
                            forfeiting what had become traditional balance of Yugoslavia’s position.
                            When, in January and February, Russians showed signs of raising price
                            for continued support of Yugoslavia in face of Chinese opposition, this
                            alarm was not only heightened but came, we suspect, to be shared in some
                            degree by <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> himself. We view
                            obvious Yugoslav eagerness for <persName corresp="#p_RD1"

                            of <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>’s desire not only to
                            reassure his own followers but actually to give some reassurance both to
                            unaligned group and to West that he had not sacrificed balance of
                            Yugoslavia’s position.</p>
                        <p>Today, great and disturbing uncertainties are still visible here on
                            eastern horizon. Yugoslavs probably know little more than we do
                            concerning <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s personal
                            position. They will have noted in recent weeks, and particularly in last
                            few days, evidence that attitude toward Yugoslavia is coming more and
                            more to constitute touchstone of Chinese-Russian differences, with
                            Chinese showing every sign of regarding <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354"
                                facs="0376"/>rejection of Yugoslavia as sine qua non of any
                            reconciliation. Yugoslavs will note with interest and some apprehension
                            that Russians are plainly reluctant to hold Central Committee meeting
                            and to redefine their ideological line before they have talked with
                            Chinese. In all, Yugoslavs are well aware events could easily take a
                            turn which could put them back in position not dissimilar to that which
                            they occupied after 1958 differences. Faced with these uncertainties
                            they are obviously trying to hold all lines open and to reserve to
                            themselves widest possible latitude of choice in reshaping their
                            international position if this becomes necessary.</p>
                        <p>Question of course presents itself as to how Western circles can exert
                            most useful influence in this highly fluid situation. They cannot hope
                            to change in any brief space of time ideological convictions of Yugoslav
                            leaders or their insistence on clinging to their image of themselves as
                            important contributors to international socialist cause and to
                            “struggle” of developing nations against colonialist and neo-colonialist
                            pressures. What Western governments can do in these circumstances is to
                            shape their policies in such way as to demonstrate daily to Yugoslav
                            regime and people that Yugoslavia always has option of economically
                            fruitful relationship with West, on terms not dangerous to stability of
                            regime, if it wishes to make reasonable effort in this direction. I must
                            reiterate, at cost of repetition, that unless such prospect of open
                            Western door is maintained, friends of Western orientation, and even
                            those among Yugoslavs who fear closer relationship with East, have no
                            effective arguments.</p>
                        <p>This means that if there was ever a time when it was folly for Western
                            countries to confront Yugoslavs with attitude of emotional rejection or
                            indifference, and above all with seemingly impenetrable economic
                            restrictions and barriers, concerning which there appears to be no
                            possibility of useful discussion, it is this present moment. So long as
                            and to extent that this situation endures, Western countries can expect,
                            in development of Yugoslav policy, almost any eventuality except those
                            most favorable to Western interests.</p>
                        <p>I must again emphasize heavy responsibility now being taken upon
                            themselves by those congressional figures who insist on confronting
                            Yugoslavia through this present period not only with <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> denial specifically but with angry and
                            vindictive posture generally. Yugoslavia’s problem is a complex one.
                            Outlook and behavior present governmental leaders will never be such as
                            to permit wholly untroubled and satisfactory US-Yugoslav relationship.
                            On contrary, we must expect that so long as present uncertainties
                            endure, <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> will continue to
                            accompany his efforts at reassurance of West and nonaligned with other
                            efforts designed to emphasize to Eastern eyes Yugoslavia’s socialist
                            quality and thus to help <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> defend Yugoslav tie against Chinese attacks.
                                <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0377"/>This will inevitably
                            continue to place restrictions on conceivable intimacy of Yugoslav
                            relationship with West. Nevertheless, even within these narrow limits
                            there are possibilities of variations in Yugoslav conduct in coming
                            period which are of considerable importance not only to us but to
                            Western security in general, particularly in view of Yugo-slavia’s
                            status as a strong and independent military factor in this area. To
                            ignore these possibilities, or to play fast and loose with them, and
                            thus to leave to the Russians exclusive privilege of trying to influence
                            and manipulate them (and this is implication of certain of attitudes we
                            have recently encountered in congressional and public opinion) strikes
                            me as clearly indefensible, particularly from standpoint of advancement
                            of Western interests in face of international communism. I would deeply
                            hope that one more effort could be made to explain, where explanation is
                            due, need for sober and considered approach to Yugoslav problem coupled
                            with greatest possible flexibility of action for executive branch in
                            handling relevant problems, and that as consequence these explanations
                            something more encouraging than anything yet visible could be caused to
                            appear for Yugoslavs on Western segment of their complex horizon.</p>

                                left Belgrade on July 27.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> said he wanted to tell the
                            President that the basis of Yugoslavia’s policy was to seek cooperation
                            with others on the basis of no discrimination on either side. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> referred to “even Stephen
                            cooperation.” He said Yugoslavia wanted to increase her economic
                            exchanges and to abandon old forms of economic relations such as those
                            based on aid from other countries. He said Yugoslavia was growing
                            industrially and agriculturally. In a few years’ time Yugoslavia would
                            be able to satisfy all her needs. She was already doing so with regard
                            to corn. Soon she would be able to switch from extensive to intensive
                            agriculture. This year Yugoslavia would have one million tons more wheat
                            than she had last year (4.4 million tons instead of 3.4 million tons).
                            Corn had not done quite as well this year. He said that Yugoslavia
                            wanted to trade as much as possible with the United States on a basis of
                            nondiscrimination. There should be a new basis of relations. Yugoslavia
                            was not asking for anything. He said that the United States had given
                            Yugoslavia a great deal when she needed it. Now she wanted to stand on
                            her own feet. He had explained all this to the Soviet Union which also
                            saw it this way. He repeated that Yugoslavia was not asking for
                            anything. He said that the Most Favored Nation clause amendment in US
                            legislation posed difficulties.</p>
                        <p>The President outlined the United States Government position against the
                                <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> amendment. He said that the
                            Trade Expansion Act was a very important measure, so it had to be signed
                            although it included that particular amendment. The President hoped that
                            perhaps in the next two weeks the Senate would restore <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> treatment to Presidential discretion.
                            It was a sensitive matter because every member of Congress wanted to
                            avoid being called pro-Communist. He said it was hard for Congressmen to
                            distinguish among the Soviet Union, Communist China, Poland, Yugoslavia,
                            and Albania. The President said he hoped that things would turn out all
                                right.<note n="2" xml:id="d162fn2">Congress was then considering
                                legislation restoring <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> status to
                                Yugoslavia. The legislation passed and was signed into law as

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> said Yugoslavia was having
                            difficulties with the Common Market, and would like to work something
                            out. There was great interest in finding some way of improving
                            commercial relations with Western Europe.</p>
                        <p>The President said he would like to clarify the United States position on
                            certain other matters. There had been very difficult moments with the
                            Soviet Union over Cuba last fall. This had been almost a disaster for
                            the United States. The memory of those events had rendered passage of
                            the Test Ban Treaty difficult, and had reduced the prospects of making
                            progress or having any faith in the Soviet Union. He said that <pb
                                n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0379"/>every effort Yugoslavia made to
                            show that she wanted to live in peace with the United States, and to
                            maintain her own independence, the easier it would be for the United
                            States to cooperate with Yugoslavia. <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName> said that the wheat sales to the Soviet Union
                            showed that discrimination can be surmounted and gotten rid of. He said
                            that economic exchanges were one of the most important factors for the
                            promotion of political agreements. The elimination of discrimination
                            made the solution of political issues much easier. He said he was glad
                            to have had the chance to present some of his views to the President,
                            and hoped that the President realized that he believed that US-Yugoslav
                            relations could evolve positively. The President said that the
                            experience of last fall with regard to Cuba had made us somewhat
                            cautious “before we embrace the bear.”</p>
                        <p>The President said he was interested in <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName>’s statement that he has confidence in the peaceful
                            objectives of the Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName> said he was confident that he was not wrong. He
                            said he knew the whole situation. He had known it several years ago, two
                            years ago, and today. Small steps should be taken and we could thus move
                            forward. There had already been the UN resolution on prohibition of
                            putting nuclear weapons in outer space. It also would be useful to make
                            progress on disarmament. He had always been in favor of a gradual
                            approach. With progress in these fields, tremendous resources could be
                            made available for aid to the less developed countries.</p>
                        <p>The President asked <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> what he
                            thought of the political evolution with regard to Eastern Europe, and
                            whether there was less of an iron grip on these countries. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> said he thought that agreements
                            with the Soviet Union would help this process. The Eastern European
                            countries did think more of economic and less of political matters. He
                            believed that the great question today was the polarization between
                            those who want peace and those who want to continue the cold war. We are
                            dealing today with criteria which are different from those of the past:
                            today the question is not who is in the bloc and who isn’t, but rather
                            who is for peace and who is against peace. More and more countries are
                            interested in nonalignment.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> asked the President
                            what he thought about Yugoslavia and the possibilities of better
                            relations between us. He personally felt that there were great
                            possibilities, and that we should have greater confidence in each other.
                            The President agreed that relations had been improving. The low point
                            had been reached at the time of the conference of nonaligned countries
                            in 1961. Now relations had improved, and the US Congressmen who had
                            recently attended the Interparliamentary Union Conference in
                                Belgrade<note n="3" xml:id="d162fn3">September 12–20.</note> had
                            been able to see things for themselves and <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358"
                                facs="0380"/>had received favorable impressions. He said he thought
                            there had been a steady climb since the low point of September 1961. He
                            said that the reception for <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>
                            in the United States today was better than it would have been two years
                            ago. It was important to take into account US history and experience.
                            The President said he wanted relations between our two countries to
                            improve.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> expressed his great
                            thanks to the United States Government for the aid which it had given to
                            Skopje following the earthquake disaster there.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d162fn4">July 26.</note> The President said that we wanted
                            to do something more with regard to housing. He said we had some
                            prefabricated housing units stocked in France, capable of housing up to
                            10,000 people, and we would be glad to make these available if this
                            would be helpful. The President said he did not know how much time it
                            would take to get them down to Yugoslavia but thought this could be
                            within about a month or so. <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>
                            expressed his warm thanks for the President’s offer, which he accepted.
                            He stressed the great need for housing in Skopje and said that housing
                            for 120,000 inhabitants was needed before December and that ultimately
                            some 200,000 units of housing would be required.</p>
                        <p>The President said he was glad to have been able to repay some of
                            Yugoslavia’s hospitality to members of his family, to various government
                            officials and to Congressmen. He hoped that more tourists would go to
                            Yugoslavia. He told <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> that he
                            might get a few pickets on his way around the United States but he
                            wanted him to understand that the President himself gets picketed and
                            that Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> is also
                            used to this. <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> said he hoped
                            the President would one day visit Yugoslavia where he would be warmly
                            welcomed. The President said, “Thank you very much.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> recalled that when he
                            had visited him in 1951,<note n="5" xml:id="d162fn5">See <ref

                            <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> was gravely concerned that
                            Stalin would unleash an attack on Yugoslavia, and he wanted <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> to know how gratified we were to
                            see a change in his relations with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>. He said that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had said last June that things
                            would be much easier if each country were left to settle its own affairs
                            by itself. He hoped that <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName>
                            would use his influence with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> in this direction. <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tito</persName> said that things have changed very much since the
                            time when Stalin had said that he wanted to make Yugoslavia one of the
                            Soviet Socialist Republics, and that Yugoslavia firmly intended to
                            maintain her independence.</p>
                        <p>The President asked <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> how much
                            of an influence he thought Yugoslavia’s policy had had on other
                            countries in Eastern Europe to follow <pb n="359" xml:id="pg_359"
                                facs="0381"/>a more independent course, e.g., Bulgaria and Poland.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tito</persName> said he thought
                            Yugoslavia’s influence had been quite considerable. He said that in
                            spite of difficulties, Eastern Europe had prospered economically. The
                            Yugoslav people were proud and courageous people and he wanted the
                            President to know that they had great sympathy for the people of the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>The meeting then broke up at about 5 o’clock.</p>

                            the earthquake of July 26, 1963, the President wishes the Secretary of
                            Defense to take such action as is necessary, using military resources as
                            appropriate, to accomplish the shipment to and erection in Skopje or its

                        <p>The Austrian Ambassador opened the conversation by saying that general
                            US-Austrian relations were good and that there were no real problems
                            remaining now that the Vienna Memorandum<note n="1" xml:id="d164fn1">For
                                text of this memorandum, May 10, 1955, outlining protections

                                States and the United Kingdom, see 7 UST 803.</note> had been
                            settled. He said that the Austrian Government did hope that the US would
                            ratify the Austrian Assets Treaty but said he did not think his
                            Government would press this claim under current circumstances because
                            the Austrians were also delinquent in settling the Jewish claims matter.
                                <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0383"/>Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PW1">Platzer</persName> then said that his Government
                            hoped if the Geneva Nuclear Test Ban negotiations were to lead to the
                            conclusion of an agreement, that the US Government would support Vienna
                            as the location for the Nuclear Test Ban Control Agency. He noted that
                            the British Government had agreed to Vienna, as had the previous US
                            Administration. Therefore, he hoped that the new Administration would
                            also agree on Vienna. The Secretary said that he saw no reason to oppose
                            location of this institution in Vienna and said that the Austrian
                            request seemed a reasonable one.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then inquired as to the members and status of Hungarian
                            refugees in Austria. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PW1"
                                >Platzer</persName> said there were about 18,000 still there and
                            that these were mostly integrated into Austrian life. It was thought
                            that around 10,000 would remain permanently. He noted that in 1956 this
                            had been a great problem when there had been 200,000 Hungarian refugees
                            in Austria. The Secretary noted that he had been in Vienna at that time
                            and had gone to Budapest with the International Red Cross.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PW1">Platzer</persName> then said that
                            his Government hoped there could be a bilateral PL 480 loan<note n="2"

                            undertake. He said that this was now in the process of being drafted and
                            that we would be consulted further on this question. He said the
                            Austrian proposal would be to use counterpart funds accruing from PL 480
                            corn. He thought the total cost was in the vicinity of $12 million, of
                            which $1.6 million would be from US sources.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then noted that we had an extremely experienced and
                            distinguished diplomat in Vienna and we expected him to stay on
                            there.</p>
                        <p>The Austrian Ambassador then reviewed the South Tyrol problem briefly. He
                            noted that this had been raised in the United Nations General Assembly
                            last fall because up until that time there had not been any progress
                                achieved.<note n="3" xml:id="d164fn3">The Special Political
                                Committee of the General Assembly heard the issue at a special

                                urging Austria and Italy to resolve their differences through direct
                                negotiations. The General Assembly approved the resolution on

                            furthermore, that the Italian and Austrian Governments started from
                            quite different premises in approaching the question. He said that the
                            Italians spoke only of the implementation of the existing de

                                1947, see 61 Stat. 1245.</note> whereas what the Austrians had in
                            mind was local autonomy in the Province of Bolzano. He said the
                            Austrians were continuing to undertake bilateral talks with the Italians
                            because this was the sense of the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>
                            resolution. He added, however, that the UN resolution spoke of seeking a
                            settlement by other peaceful means if it were not possible through
                            direct bilateral talks.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he thought a solution of this problem would take
                            patience and a long time.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary inquired as to whether there were any contacts in Vienna
                            with Eastern Europe through students, etc. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PW1">Platzer</persName> said there were not many Eastern
                            European students in Austria but noted that some contacts did take place
                            during the Vienna Trade Fair. He then referred to Austrian efforts in
                            the cultural and other fields in underdeveloped countries. The Secretary
                            said that the help of all the European countries to the underdeveloped
                            countries is extremely useful and thought that countries such as Austria
                            should supply experts and technicians which were even more in short
                            supply than money.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PW1">Platzer</persName> then referred to
                            the Common Market–<gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> problem which he
                            said was a serious one for Austria. The Secretary said <pb n="362"
                                xml:id="pg_362" facs="0384"/>that we, of course, did not know what
                            the outcome of this problem would be but that we hoped the <gloss
                                target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> would be of assistance. He thought
                            the presence of friendly outsiders such as ourselves in the <gloss
                                target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> might be useful and that an ultimate
                            solution depended on time, patience, and hard work. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PW1">Platzer</persName> said that Austria’s problems
                            were made acute by the fact that fifty percent of her trade was with the
                            Common Market countries whereas only twelve percent was with the other
                            six <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> countries. Italy and Germany
                            were the main trading partners of Austria. He added that Austria also
                            imported wheat, cotton, and corn in large quantities from the United
                            States. The Secretary inquired if tourism was the main source of dollar
                            income for Austria. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PW1"
                                >Platzer</persName> said that Austria’s principal exports were iron
                            and steel products and other industrial products. He said that tourism
                            did definitely assist in the balance of payments field. For example,
                            Austria imported about $100 million a year in products from the United
                            States while exporting only about $50 million to us. Tourism largely
                            made up this difference so that the Austrian dollar position was not
                            unfavorable.</p>

                                >Waldheim</persName> called on the Under Secretary in the course of
                            a “get acquainted” trip to Washington. On the subject of the South
                            Tyrol, Dr. <persName>Steiner</persName> said that the Austrian
                            Government hoped that a final settlement acceptable to the people of the
                            area of the South Tyrol would result from the work of the Italian study
                            commission recently established under the aegis of the Italian Ministry
                            of the Interior. However, the work of this commission could hardly be
                                <pb n="363" xml:id="pg_363" facs="0385"/>completed before next March
                            at the earliest. In the meantime, the Austrian Government desired an
                            agreement with the Italians on peaceful methods of settlement to be
                            adopted should the commission fail to achieve a solution. Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName> had made two
                            specific proposals in this regard to Foreign Minister Segni in New
                                York:<note n="1" xml:id="d165fn1">The Foreign Ministers met during

                            up to deal with the substance of the dispute. He said there had been no
                            response from the Italians as yet to this proposal but that the Austrian
                            Government would be in further bilateral touch with the Italians before
                            the October 23 deadline when the “truce” on the General Assembly debate

                            relations and Common Market negotiations. He said he would send me
                            copies of the two speeches he had made in Finland during his recent
                            visit. I said I had already read with considerable interest his first
                            speech on Austrian neutrality transmitted by our Embassy in Helsinki. He
                            said that he felt his second speech was “even more anti-Communist” than
                            the first though the “young and inexperienced Austrian reporters” seemed
                            to have misinterpreted some of his major points. It was much more
                            important for him to make those speeches in Finland with Russians
                            present than here in Austria.</p>
                        <p>He then referred to his remarks concerning possible negotiations with ECE
                            which have been “misunderstood” in some circles here.“After sending our

                                n="364" xml:id="pg_364" facs="0386"/>he said. “The ECE is an
                            organization to which the Russians belong but in which the West can
                            outvote the Soviet bloc. The United States is likewise a full member. To
                            talk about trade or other economic questions in that forum seems to me
                            at least harmless even though it is mostly ‘bla bla’; it might even in
                            the long run produce some results.” In talking to Avilov latter had
                            complained that Austria only dealt with <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> or Western organizations, why not make some approach
                            to CEMA. <persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName> replied that
                            because of fact CEMA has many political provisions and implications with
                            which Austria could not be associated and its whole system is based on
                            state trading and controls with which Austria could not be associated,
                            this was impossible. He, <persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName>,
                            suggested ECE as a possible forum to which both United States and Soviet
                            Union belonged and he saw no objection to discussing Soviet proposals in
                            that forum. Avilov asked whether Austria would discuss all Soviet
                            proposals. <persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName> replied not all
                            but those which seem “reasonable”. Avilov, he said, seemed
                            interested.</p>
                        <p>In other words, <persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName> clearly
                            considers his ECE gesture as a demonstration of Austrian neutrality
                            between the two blocs which might lessen future Soviet pressure and cost
                            Austria nothing tangible. He hoped we would understand his motivation
                            and the need for some such gesture.</p>

                            insistence that Austrian negotiations with the Common Market must go on.
                            This was not only against the strong opposition of <persName
                                corresp="#p_GA1">Gorbach</persName>, Bock, etc. as well as Austrian
                            industrialists who were opposed to taking any steps at this time in fear
                            of offending the Soviets, but they had even sent some of his Socialist
                            friends to try to persuade him to agree. He said he had made it quite
                            clear that if the announced note were not sent he would resign and
                            publicly explain the reasons. It would have been a fatal invitation to
                            the Russians to step up their pressure. During his absence in Finland,
                            he said, “they made two changes weakening the original text in our note
                            to the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> which I would not have agreed
                            to had I been there, but they were very minor ones.” The Govt had also
                            agreed to substitute the word “arrangements” for “association”, though
                            he said the Russians of course “really understand the distinction
                            between association and membership, whatever they may pretend to the
                            contrary.” I inquired concerning a current rumor that the Chancellor and
                            some others in government circles would now like to withdraw the note
                            and he said this was not true.</p>

                        <p>After opening the meeting, Mr. <persName>Newman</persName> called on Mr.
                                <persName>Cross</persName> to comment on the practicability of the
                            Export-Import Bank as a source of credit for foreign arms purchases in
                            the United States. Mr. <persName>Cross</persName> said the EXIM Bank is
                            a possibility which should be explored, but he said the Bank does not
                            usually operate in the military field. Therefore, there is little past
                            history which would be useful in the present consideration. Ordinarily
                            the Bank extends credit for a maximum of five years, but somewhat longer
                            terms may be possible.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said the Austrian Government had agreed on an increase in
                            the military budget, but the rate and extent of the increase would not
                            be adequate for the quick buildup which is necessary. He stated that it
                            was his hope to obtain credit under the terms of the Mutual Security
                            Military Sales Program although it would be necessary to give it another
                            appearance. Mr. <persName>Newman</persName> said we would do our best to
                            meet the Austrian need. It is, however, a problem which requires further
                            study. He assured the Minister that we will seek to come as close as we
                            can to the requested solution.</p>
                        <p>The Minister repeated that it is his aim to acquire the equipment over a
                            three-year period, with payment stretched over a ten-year period. In
                            addition to ammunition, the Minister intends to acquire modern tanks,
                            communications equipment, and spare parts. Mr.
                                <persName>Newman</persName> inquired what the difference in interest
                            rates might be from the various sources. Mr. <persName>Cross</persName>
                            stated that, since there is no precedent, it would be impossible to
                            state what the EXIM Bank rate might be. The recent rate for export
                            promotion credits, which would be the most comparable, was 5–3/4 per
                            cent. However, the terms would, of course, depend upon further <pb
                                n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0388"/>negotiations. The Minister
                            interjected that such an interest rate would be unacceptable to the
                            Austrian Government as a basis for negotiations. He stated frankly that
                            he had hoped for no-interest credit under MSMS. Mr.
                                <persName>Barringer</persName> responded that the current MSMS
                            credit rate was 3–1/2 per cent. Non-interest terms applied only to
                            so-called cash sales, for which payment could be made in installments up
                            to a maximum of three years. Mr. <persName>Newman</persName> said these
                            were questions which could be studied further and negotiated later.</p>
                        <p>The Minister inquired whether, as a minimum, the way could be indicated
                            by which a solution to the problem might be achieved. Mr.
                                <persName>Barringer</persName> replied that, following the meetings
                            in the Pentagon this morning, Defense Department attorneys had been in
                            touch with both the Treasury and the EXIM Bank. He had been assured
                            that, if terms could be negotiated with the Austrian Government, the
                            problem of processing all documents and other formalities through the
                            EXIM Bank could be managed. Mr. <persName>Newman</persName> commented
                            that the Pentagon had obviously lost no time in exploring the matter. He
                            assured the Minister that we understood and appreciated the Austrian
                            position. The Minister expressed his thanks.</p>
                        <p>It was suggested that representatives of the interested offices meet in
                            the near future with Dr. <persName>Edgar</persName> Plan, Financial
                            Counselor of the Austrian Embassy, to continue the discussion. The
                            Defense Minister and Ambassador concurred in this proposal.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador inquired about the prospects for approval of Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_SK1">Schleinzer</persName>’s request for a $50
                            million credit to purchase US military equipment. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ1">Sulser</persName> replied that a further meeting of
                            representatives <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0389"/>of interested
                            offices had taken place on April 3, and we were proceeding to clarify
                            some of the problems involved. We hoped to be in a position to meet with
                            Dr. <persName>Plan</persName> and Colonel <persName>Rainer</persName>
                            soon. We were somewhat concerned that the Minister might have gotten the
                            impression from the sympathy and encouragement which he encountered on
                            all of his calls that the matter was simpler than in fact it would be.
                            The discussion on April 3 had revealed that there were several
                            substantial problems to be solved.</p>
                        <p>The Export-Import Bank appeared to be willing in principle to act as a
                            “front” or go-between to give the transaction a commercial appearance.
                            This might be relatively uncomplicated as far as items such as new tanks
                            and communications equipment, which could be procured directly from the
                            manufacturers. Certain items, however, such as ammunition, which could
                            probably be procured only from the Defense Department, would present a
                            problem of documentation. The Export-Import Bank would probably be
                            unable to accept title to any of the items involved in the transaction.
                            Therefore, if Ex-Im is to serve as the channel, some means of
                            “commercial” documentation will have to be found for items procured
                            directly from the Defense Department.</p>
                        <p>The problem of financing, of course, is the major hurdle. If Ex-Im and/or
                            private sources are to be used, the total cost, including guarantee
                            charges, would probably not be much under 6%. Military assistance funds
                            which would bear lower interest rates are extremely scarce.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, it seems likely that the transaction could not be realized in
                            one piece with a single source of financing and a single agreement.
                            Particularly because of the financing problem, it might even be
                            necessary to space the various pieces of a “package deal” over a period
                            of time.</p>
                        <p>Provided that the total cost could be held to a reasonable figure and the
                            commercial appearance maintained only through several apparently
                            separate transactions, the Ambassador said he thought this would be
                            acceptable to the Austrian Government. Furthermore, since delivery of
                            the equipment was desired only over a three-year period, he also thought
                            it would be acceptable to have the various agreements spread over a
                            similar period of time. He said the Austrian Government sincerely
                            appreciated the obvious desire of the U.S. Government to meet the
                            Austrian request.</p>

                            CM, why important competitive products like steel and machinery would be

                        <p>Bielka said general agreement had been reached at the expert level during
                            harmonious Geneva talks on definition of limitations imposed by
                            neutrality on Common Market participation, and he expected paper thereon
                            would be approved by Ministers at Stockholm. Agreement was likewise
                            reached on very general paper setting forth objectives of three neutrals
                            and contributions they expected to make in Common Market arrangements.
                            This will likewise come before Ministers at Stockholm.</p>
                        <p>There have been suggestions from Brussels that the CM commission could
                            meet with representatives of three neutrals in May for exploratory
                            talks. Bielka feels strongly that this should be preceded by opportunity
                            for Ministers of three neutrals to present their general “statement of
                            intent” to Common Market Ministers. Statement will be designed reassure
                            Soviet bloc re maintenance neutral status but at same time assure West

                        <p>Austrians had approached both Schroeder and Fayat during their recent
                            visits here and found them both receptive to this idea. Similar
                            approaches are now being made to Italians, Dutch and French. He sensed
                            certain embarrassment on part of CM members that nearly six months have
                            passed without any gesture toward neutrals by CM other than
                            acknowledgment of December note.</p>
                        <p>Austria recognizes it cannot expect real negotiations until conclusion of
                            British talks but does feel it important to make such an approach before
                            summer holidays. It fears also that any exploratory talks by experts not
                            preceded by Ministerial presentation would arouse further Russian
                            suspicions and opposition where Ministerial presentation would confirm
                            and clarify December approach.</p>

                            United States sought to postpone a visit until 1963 because of President

                                Delay in getting the talks started had been due to the technical

                            talks, and later confirmed in Embassy talk with Harrer, that <persName

                                corresp="#p_SK1">Schleinzer</persName> implied to ARMA that a credit

                            negotiations. Finance Minister had indeed operated on assumption loan
                            would carry no interest. As things now stand <persName corresp="#p_KJ2"
                                >Klaus</persName> had not approved accepting credits under terms
                            provided proposed US package. Harrer had prepared report for Fin Min
                            based on info just received by him from Defense Ministry confirming that
                            about four percent interest involved and repayment of about seven years.
                            Claimed that such terms could not be approved by Fin Min. Harrer’s
                            report included certain recommendations for counterproposals which Fin
                            Min had not as yet acted on. Harrer departing for US on assumption that
                            counterproposals would be approved early next week and serve as basis
                            negotiations. Implied he would have some sort of limited signing
                            authority but could not at present be more specific about
                            counterproposals. Embassy officer remarked that trip to US on assumption
                            non-interest loan achievable would be waste of time. Harrer admitted
                            this but reiterated suggested repayment period much too short and
                            suggested interest rate considerably too high.</p>
                        <p>Embassy has been in frequent touch with Harrer, and upon return ARMA from

                            after peace treaty, Austrians have since followed consistent policy
                            making only token purchases from East bloc. At time visit several years
                            ago, Soviet Defense Minister Malinovsky urged Austria request Soviet
                            equipment. No action taken on this offer but it can be anticipated
                            similar and perhaps more specific offer would now be made to <persName

                            (perhaps mainly through Czechs or Poles) repeat attractive credit
                            proposals we know have been made in past. Having gotten nowhere with
                            Raab government on matter, they will now try hard test <persName

                            Perhaps source was simply forewarning us that our credit proposal would
                            have to be sufficiently favorable to avoid easy rejection by Chancellor
                            on purely financial grounds but in any case developments suggest some

                            Avilov October 16. Avilov, speaking for his government, gave stern
                            warning (but no ultimatum) about Soviet disapproval “negative attitude”
                            of Austria on question <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. Avilov
                            brushed aside <persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName>’s familiar

                            “beitritt” (joining) and “anschluss.” Demarche was verbal, but Avilov
                            implied formal note would follow.</p>
                        <p>Soviets expressed astonishment at public Austrian statement optimism

                            position very clear. Austrian neutrality and state treaty prohibited
                            formal ties with Common Market and Soviet relations with Austria would

                            should understand Soviets view Common Market as economic base for <gloss

                                >NATO</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName> alluded
                            to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khru-shchev</persName>’s statement during
                            Moscow visit that Soviets also want agreement with <gloss

                            denied same privilege. Avilov answered difference great. Soviets simply
                            wanted trade with <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> whereas Austria
                            wanted integration. When <persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName>
                            pointed out Austria proceeding jointly with Swiss and Swedes, Avilov
                            off-handedly replied Soviets no longer view Swiss and Swedes as true
                            neutrals. (Kriesky put this down as impulsive personal response rather
                            than official government position.) Avilov then berated Austrians for
                            participating European Space Agency (ESRO), stating that this too was
                            program serving Western military objectives and not consonant
                            neutrality. <persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName> said anything,
                            including telephone, can be instrument of war. Austrians cannot deny
                            themselves right benefit from participating peaceful rocket research any
                            more that they can on communications research. Otherwise country would
                            be relegated backwater in keeping up with technological change.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName> cautious about assessing
                            reasons for Soviet approach at this time. He thought it was part of
                            basic campaign against <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> but also
                            beginning of intensified bloc pressure on Austria. He repeated his views
                            of Moscow’s proliferation of trouble spots during periods tension. In
                            Embassy’s view, Soviets may also have been encouraged by Moscow trip
                            Vice Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_PB1">Pittermann</persName> and his
                            recent ill-timed and partially misinterpreted public statements on
                            “economic neutrality”. Soviets also of course aware Austrian Government
                            in midst heated political campaign and unable take strong coordinated
                            government action until after November 18 elections. Also may hope
                            renewed threats, combined with existing internal opposition to <gloss

                            reconsider Austrian position re <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName>, however, foresees no shift

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName> said Austria had settled
                            its differences and established good working relations with all of its
                            neighbors. After working well with Bulgaria and Rumania, they were now
                            taking up Hungary and perhaps ultimately would take on Czechoslovakia.
                            He felt it Austria’s political task to keep the region calm, and felt
                            that they were having reasonable success. They were also collaborating
                            closely with the church and had been able to assist in its concerns in
                            Hungary. In a way, they were achieving a certain “liberation” of the
                            area and it was now possible for thousands of people from the Communist
                            countries to come to Austria where they could see a free, prosperous and
                            happy society where people were “free to complain”.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName> said there was a certain
                            disintegration in process in the Bloc. For the present, it was largely
                            economic. If Moscow could not put pressure on Albania, the satellites
                            had to realize that Moscow certainly could also not push them around.
                            The opportunity to choose either of two leaders gave satellites a
                            certain freedom of action. For example, Rumania refused to take sides
                            until it had what it wanted from the Soviet Union in economic questions.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> badly needed the
                            support of all European Communist parties and in each of them there were
                            nuclei of doctrinal opposition.</p>
                        <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0405"/>
                        <p>The Secretary asked about the iron curtain on the Hungarian border and
                                <persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName> said they were moving
                            cautiously to weaken it. They were proposing a treaty with Hungary for a
                            mixed commission which would deal with frontier incidents on the spot
                            rather than involving the two governments at top levels. They were
                            working out an exchange of farmlands on both sides of the frontier which
                            had been troublesome.</p>
                        <p>To a question from the Secretary, <persName corresp="#p_KB1"
                                >Kreisky</persName> replied that he saw no reduction of fear of
                            Germany in Eastern Europe. It might not be so evident now, but it was
                            always an important imponderable.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAEIII1">Stevenson</persName> asked
                            about internal shifts in Czechoslovakia and said they had recently shown
                            some interest in increased trade with us. <persName corresp="#p_KB1"
                                >Kreisky</persName> said Czechoslovakia was the most reactionary (in
                            the Communist sense) of the satellites. They had left it to the
                            Stalinists to liquidate Stalinism. This had not been possible and
                            therefore, they were only now moving in that direction. He suggested it
                            would be best to stand off for several weeks or months to see how things
                            go. It seemed unwise to deal with people who might soon depart.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName> said that minorities from
                            the satellite nations living in Austria were loyal to Austria and that
                            no efforts were being made to use them to stir up trouble in Austria.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName> said Ulbricht was an
                            arch Stalinist. He remained in power as a figurehead and as a matter of
                            prestige. With <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s
                            departure, perhaps this would change.<note n="1" xml:id="d181fn1"
                                    ><persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>, who had
                                announced his intention to step down in September 1962, resigned as
                                German Chancellor on October 11.</note> Ulbricht was known to be
                            disagreeable and inflexible and had no political sense at all. The
                            Communists needed a man more adequate to their present policies.</p>

                            work with a group of 4 rather than a group of 18 and that problem was
                            procedural rather than substantive. France’s cooperation in <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and UN was similarly limited.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> was coming
                            in October and we hoped for some improvement. The Secretary said the
                            question was how Europe is to be organized. Closer cooperation might
                            have been possible if a directorium had been accepted in 1958, but
                            Europe would not accept it. There was not now even a consensus as to how
                            we should consult. <persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName>
                            summarized by saying that in the past France had had a policy of
                            presence; now they had a policy of absence.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary turned to the prospects for the <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                                >Kennedy</persName> Round. <persName corresp="#p_KB1"
                                >Kreisky</persName> said he thought there was a good chance for
                            success if discussions were kept on purely economic grounds. Success was
                            favored by the probability that by the time of the negotiations the
                            position of “outsiders,” like Austria and the Scandinavians, would be
                            improved. Austria, together with Denmark and to some extent Norway,
                            wanted to stay out of political complications. He did not believe
                            Erhardt would change the structure of German policy, but he was an
                            economic man and talked in those terms. DeGaulle was always interested
                            in economic matters—although for him agriculture was not an economic
                            matter. <persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName> agreed with the
                            Secretary that a political will for successful negotiations was
                            essential but he considered that the discussions and the agreements
                            themselves should be economic in nature. The Secretary said <persName
                                corresp="#p_HW1">Hallstein</persName>’s views were similar.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName> said for DeGaulle it was
                            absolute doctrine to prevent political influence of the Anglo-Saxons in
                            European affairs. He was hard and inflexible and just would not change.
                            DeGaulle saw the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> as a delicate
                            balance based on Germany and would not let it be disturbed.
                            Nevertheless, we should always seek new approaches and new points of
                            departure. For the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> this would be
                            natural and easier after their elections. In the long run, the problems
                            would be solved.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName> said Austria had the
                            warmest feelings of friendship for Italy and wants very much to settle
                            their differences by negotiation. On the South Tyrol he saw two
                            differing approaches in Italy. There were those, more toward the Right,
                            who wanted to settle it internally by dealing with powerful interests in
                            the Tyrol. This would only lead to new discontent and disorder and, in a
                            few months the Austrian Government would again be involved. The other
                            group, rather to the Left, favored agreement with Austria which would
                            obviate further Austrian intervention. At present everything in Italy
                            was in flux and they are not now ready to talk seriously. It was too
                            late to have polite conversations about procedure, they had to get down
                            to substance.</p>
                        <p>The Rossi Commission Report<note n="1" xml:id="d183fn1">A report prepared
                                by a committee of Italian parliamentarians, chaired by Social

                            points, <persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName> said. Austria felt
                            it necessary to reach an agreement in which the Italians would say how
                            they would deal with problems which might arise in the future. Austria
                            believes the best procedure for this would be agreement by the Italian
                            Government to deal with the Senators from the South Tyrol as the true
                            representatives of these people. This was the way the Italians dealt
                            with other internal problems. The Austrian Government wants a formal
                            document, perhaps an annex to the Paris Accord, and would also want to
                            report any agreement to the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. Such a
                            formal agreement would include provisions for treating any breach of the
                            agreement. For this purpose Austria was not averse to the International
                            Court’s acting.</p>
                        <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0408"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName> said there were minorities
                            in many European countries and there were satisfactory arrangements for
                            all except for those in the South Tyrol. He warned that there was real
                            danger in the situation. If Italy and Austria reached no agreement this
                            would become a German/Italian issue. This was already true in part of
                            German public opinion. He did not welcome the engagement of the German
                            press in the problem and wished above all to avoid its becoming a
                            pan-German issue. Within the CDU in the Federal Republic, there were
                            strong nationalist elements and exile German groups with great influence
                            who were pressing to make the Brenner boundary an issue like the
                            Oder-Neisse boundary. <persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName> said
                            Italy had failed to heed his warning about terrorism and the center of
                            these activities had now shifted to Munich.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName> complained that the
                            Italians kept finding pretexts to cancel meetings with the Austrians. He
                            said the U.S. had not been able to accept his proposals several years
                            ago that we tell the Italians they must cope with the problem and offer
                            our assistance, as had been done successfully in Trieste. The Secretary
                            noted the great and numerous burdens which we have in the world. He
                            implored <persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName> to save us this
                            one and to work it out with the Italians.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName> said they did not intend to
                            ask for <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> action this year. They had to
                            keep the pressure on Italy and, therefore, he had reported on the matter
                            in his address to the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>Turning to the subject of relations with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                                >EEC</gloss>, Minister <persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName>
                            said that exploratory talks between Austria and the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> had started. So far as the economic
                            matters to be discussed were concerned, he thought it would be possible
                            to find a common ground with the Commission. However, this might not be
                            possible with the Council. The French, for example, would want an answer
                            soon on Austria’s attitude toward <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss>.
                            To this the Austrian Government will reply that it cannot take a
                            position before seeing what sort of an arrangement is worked out with
                            the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_KB1"
                                >Kreisky</persName> noted a dilemma here, with France pressing for
                            Austrian withdrawal from <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss>, while
                            the Dutch, he thought, would not want to see <gloss target="#t_EFTA1"
                                >EFTA</gloss> weakened at this stage by such a move. The main
                            problem, however, was what Austria could actually do, and this will
                            require that the Austrian Government come to an internal agreement on
                            this. He noted that Austrian trade within <gloss target="#t_EFTA1"
                                >EFTA</gloss> had increased from 11.5% to 16.8% without any loss of
                            trade with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. This growing <gloss
                                target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> market had considerable appeal to
                            Austria and it would be reluctant to take any steps which would damage
                            this trade. Moreover, the Socialist Party and elements within the
                            People’s Party would both be unhappy to leave <gloss target="#t_EFTA1"
                                >EFTA</gloss> so long as the other two neutrals were still members.
                            In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>’s query
                            whether membership in both <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> was not an unrealistic goal,
                            the Minister agreed that it was, but he still favored such a
                            “multilateral” solution, even if it were unrealistic. Moreover, at the
                            present time matters in Europe were perhaps on the verge of change with
                            Erhard coming to power in Germany and with the strong possibility that a
                            Labor Government would soon take over in the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss>. However, he agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> that things would not change very fast.</p>
                        <p>In response to the Minister’s question of what he thought about the
                            possibility of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> association with
                            the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> replied that he had spoken to French Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> about
                            this a few days ago, and <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName>
                            gave the impression that the French were not serious in this and that
                            even a trade arrangement between the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                            and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would be impossible unless the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> were to give up its special
                            relationship with the United States and the Commonwealth. Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName> added that he thought
                            perhaps a Labor Government might be more receptive to the idea of
                            association—that oddly enough, a Labor Government would be more Anglo
                            Saxon than the Conservatives. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> agreed except that it might be difficult for Labor
                            to deal with a Gaullist Government in France. Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName> thought this would be no more
                            difficult than for the United States to deal with Spain.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName> went on to note
                            that the neutrals were of course no problem for <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. The problem was, as he had
                            stated earlier, what the Austrian Government could do. Turning to the
                            present attitude of the neutrals, <persName corresp="#p_KB1"
                                >Kreisky</persName> said that while the Swiss had initially been
                            very <pb n="388" xml:id="pg_388" facs="0410"/>strong in their support of
                                <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss>, they were now less favorably
                            disposed. This was because the Swiss industrialists were concerned about
                            the Socialist complexion of <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss>. With
                            Socialist Governments in the Scandinavian countries, with a Labor
                            Government probable in England, and a half-Socialist Government in
                            Austria, the Swiss were worried that <gloss target="#t_EFTA1"
                                >EFTA</gloss> might rely too much on government planning. Sweden,
                            while in favor of association with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                                >EEC</gloss>, was unwilling to leave <gloss target="#t_EFTA1"
                                >EFTA</gloss>. The presence of the two neutrals and their continued
                            support of <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> led <persName
                                corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName> to want to have Austria remain
                            in <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss>. In passing, he thought the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> under a Labor Government would be
                            positive towards <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss>, which was, in
                            fact, a sort of European Commonwealth.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> asked how
                            Austrian trade with its Eastern European neighbors was going, to which
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName> replied that at
                            the moment it seemed stabilized. The problem, as always, was what could
                            the Bloc sell Austria in order to enable the Bloc to buy from it? While
                            the USSR was presently able to purchase for cash, he thought that it
                            would not be long before it would be pressing for credit. The meeting
                            closed with a brief discussion of the present grain crisis in the USSR
                            and of the USSR’s intention greatly to expand its fertilizer output.</p>

                        <p>The President greeted the Foreign Minister and said that he had heard
                            that President Truman had admired very much the speech that <pb n="389"
                                xml:id="pg_389" facs="0411"/>the Foreign Minister had given in
                            Kansas City. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_KB1"
                                >Kreisky</persName> said he had enjoyed talking with the former
                            President and had received a fine lesson in modern American history. He
                            had met many, many businessmen and other civic leaders.</p>
                        <p>The President said we were having some difficulties with the Soviets on
                            the autobahn. Our convoys were still being held up. We did not know what
                            this development indicated as far as the Soviets were concerned. Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName> said he had just
                            heard of this development. He had just told Mr. <persName

                                found.</note> that the real problem was that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was very popular with the
                            Soviet people because he stood for two things—peace and
                            de-Stalinization—but having popularity with the Russian people meant
                            nothing to the Communists. An outstanding German Communist had once told
                            him that Stalin thought he could build up the same apparatus in China as
                            they had developed in the Soviet Union. The German Communist was asked
                            if this were done what would happen if there had to be a choice between
                            the support of the majority of the people and support of the people in
                            the hierarchy. He replied he thought in any event the decisions must
                            conform with the pressures of convictions of the hierarchy. This
                            conformed to the Communist pattern.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_KB1">Kreisky</persName> said that
                            as far as he could see there were only two individuals in the Soviet
                            Union who might be in a position to succeed <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>. There was no doubt in his mind but that the
                            Soviet leaders were already preparing for the period after <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. These two men were
                                <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> and Malinovskiy. He
                            did not include Malinovskiy as one of the two because he was important
                            as a Marshal of the Soviet Union but because he was important as a
                            Communist leader. The Foreign Minister had known Malinovskiy personally
                            right after the war in Vienna and said he thought he was intelligent.
                            Malinovskiy had served in the French army during the First World War and
                            spoke French. He thought Malinovskiy was a brilliant man. He said
                            Malinovskiy had told him a story that shortly after the war when the
                            Soviets were occupying Austria Stalin had received a message from the
                            then Austrian President <persName>Karl Renner</persName> to say that the
                            people had nothing to eat and Stalin had telephoned from Moscow to
                            Malinovskiy and had asked him what he could do. Malinovskiy said he
                            replied that he could provide 20,000 tons of wheat. Stalin expressed
                            surprise at this relatively large amount. Malinovskiy said he wanted to
                            tell Stalin a story and he told the story of <persName corresp="#p_VP1"
                                >Peter</persName> the Great who had received a delegation of Germans
                            who had asked for some material assistance. <persName corresp="#p_VP1"
                                >Peter</persName> the Great had reportedly replied that he would not
                            give them the material assistance <pb n="390" xml:id="pg_390"
                                facs="0412"/>they required but would give them a whole city. When
                            one of his ministers started to protest, he told him to shut up and said
                            he was giving them their own city.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said he thought Kozlov was out of everything because
                            he was a very sick man. Mikoyan was not a Russian and the other leaders
                            such as Suslov were basically technicians.</p>
                        <p>The President said he thought the timing of the recent Soviet action on
                            the autobahn was quite curious. The Foreign Minister said he was certain
                            that this action did not have the approval of <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. Also he was convinced that
                            it could not be said that this development was caused by a lack of
                            communications or bad organization. The Soviets might have their
                            problems but they were not in the organization or communications of the
                            Soviet army.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> might have a great deal of popular support
                            and have a commanding position within the Politburo but there were two
                            areas which gave evidence that he did not have complete control. One was
                            Albania and the other was Molotov. Albania was a relatively small
                            country and if <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> wanted
                            to, the Russians could take it over in two hours. The Albanians had more
                            people in their Embassy in Vienna than there were in the Austrian
                            Embassy in Washington. These people distributed booklets against the
                            Soviet Union. As for Molotov, he was still walking the streets of
                            Moscow. The Foreign Minister said he was convinced that the leaders of
                            the Communist parties in Europe and Asia were continuously working to
                            overcome the Peking–Moscow split.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said in his opinion the President’s policy was the
                            only possible one at this time. We had to be responsive to the Soviet
                            approaches. We could never find out how far the Soviets might be
                            prepared to go unless we were willing to meet them. He personally
                            believed that a policy could only be built through direct conversations.
                            The Foreign Minister said in this context he had been in favor of Mayor
                            Brandt of Berlin meeting personally with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>. To make it a question of policy whether to
                            meet with the Soviets or not would always be doomed to failure. It was
                            important to meet.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said he thought that the role of Germany in
                            East-West relations would be easier after <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                                >Adenauer</persName> had stepped down. Erhard would be more in favor
                            of dealing with the Soviets. On the other hand <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> would use his power against
                            such dealings and he would use it with all the resentment of an old man
                            but in a short time the <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Christian</persName>
                            Democrats would react against him. The party would soon decide in favor
                            of the new Chancellor. It would be an extremely difficult situation.</p>
                        <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0413"/>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that German Foreign Minister Schroeder was a
                            much more intelligent man than Erhard. Erhard was not a very clever man.
                            He was not a man to handle political power and would have a lot of
                            difficulties. Erhard had had to wait a long time before becoming
                            Chancellor and <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had done a
                            great deal to undercut him by making such remarks as saying that
                            Professor Erhard believed he was a German miracle. The Foreign Minister
                            felt that Erhard would not be Chancellor for a long period of time.
                            Foreign Minister Schroeder was a coming man and former Defense Minister
                            Strauss was not dead politically. The Foreign Minister said he
                            personally believed that if a coalition government was formed with the
                            Socialist Party, Strauss would be in the government. The situation after
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> was really not a very
                            clear one but any real political change could only emerge from a great
                            coalition. Neither party could run the risk of making a major move
                            vis-à-vis the Soviets for fear of being accused of treason against
                            Germany.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said he thought the next election in Germany might
                            see an increase in Socialist strength by about three percent. He felt
                            that personalities could only affect the vote by some two to three
                            percent. Below that was a hard core of votes which would not change.</p>
                        <p>The President asked for the Foreign Minister’s judgment regarding Europe
                            and the United States. He pointed out that our policies toward Europe
                            were based on past as well as present policies. The Foreign Minister
                            replied that to speak of Europe as a unit was unrealistic. He felt there
                            would be no unified Europe. Rather Europe would be divided into two
                            major groupings. One would be the Europe des patries and the other would
                            be a Europe des affaires. Europe would not be a unit because <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> detested integration and
                            there was no real desire among the Six to integrate with France. The
                            second point he wished to make regarding Europe was that one must
                            understand that there was a real divergence between generations. The
                            younger generation was for the unity of Europe and was not for <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>. The Foreign Minister said
                            that if one compared the crowds in Germany that greeted <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> with the crowds that had
                            greeted the President you would find that those who cheered <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> came from the middle
                            generation and those that cheered the President were predominantly from
                            the younger generation. The younger generation was now extremely tired
                            of the old man who was in power. They were attracted to the President
                            because he represented a young nation and was himself young. The Foreign
                            Minister said he was not saying this out of flattery but that this was a
                            fact. The whole way of living of the younger generation in Europe was
                            nearer to the younger generation of America in such things as clothes,
                            dances, newspapers, etc. He could see it in his own children. The
                            American way of life had had a lot of influence on European youth. The
                            Foreign Minister said he had also noticed during his visits around the
                            United States <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0414"/>that Europe had
                            had an influence on American youth. This was not a political fact but it
                            was the basis for political conclusions.</p>
                        <p>As far as <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> was concerned
                            the Foreign Minister said that no one could change him. He was an old
                            man and he had made his policies with a view to history. He ignored
                            Parliament. It was an ironic fact that the one party in France which had
                            always been against Parliament, namely the Communists, had lost out
                            because Parliament had no power. By liquidating the French Parliament,
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had made the French
                            Communists powerless. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                            was following a policy of absence.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said he thought the only way to handle <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, if it was possible to do so,
                            was to ignore him and not to provoke the French. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> was a great man for France
                            and he was a great man in his own right. He believed that the
                            Anglo-Saxons had to be kept outside of Europe. Swiss Foreign Minister
                            Wahlen had told him that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> should have said that the United Kingdom could
                            join Europe but they would have to come “naked as a worm”.</p>

                            two governments together again in reasonably cordial atmosphere. More
                            important consideration is what contents Rossi Commission report will

                        <p>From <persName corresp="#p_WK1">Waldheim</persName>’s comments we gather
                            that Austrian Foreign Office, at least, fervently hopes Rossi report
                            will be accepted by Italian Government and that political leaders South
                            Tyrol can muster necessary support for it. If this should happen,
                            Foreign Office envisages Austrian-Italian agreed report to UN and

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName> had invited Ambassador
                            Bielka to lunch. A member of the Austrian delegation to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>, Bielka had come to Washington for a
                            three-day visit.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName>Bielka</persName> said that some of the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> countries had been pressing Austria for
                            a commitment to leave the <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> if an
                                Austrian-<gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> arrangement were
                            successfully negotiated. French Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> was one of those
                            insisting that Austria make such a commitment. Austria, however, did not
                            wish to commit itself, no matter how informally, until it had a much
                            clearer idea than now of what kind of an arrangement it would be able to
                            work out with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. Austria’s trade
                            with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> had not suffered to date as
                            result of the increased <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                            discriminatory tariffs, but some manufacturers and exporters were
                            complaining that, in order to compete in the Common Market, they had to
                            reduce their profit margins and even sell at a loss on occasion. It was
                            extremely difficult to ascertain how much truth there was in these
                            complaints.</p>
                        <p>Turning to Eastern Europe, Dr. <persName>Bielka</persName> said that
                            there were indications that important changes were taking place there.
                            He referred specifically to the recent relaxation of travel regulations
                            by Czechoslovakia and Hungary and to the apparent attempts by the
                            satellites to gain a greater degree of economic independence from the
                            USSR. He knew of no recent developments concerning Cardinal Mindszenty.
                            Cardinal Koenig, who had seen Cardinal Mindszenty at the U.S. Legation
                            in Budapest several months ago, had been attending the Ecumenical
                            Council in Rome during the past two months.</p>
                        <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395" facs="0417"/>
                        <p>In reply to a question, Dr. <persName>Bielka</persName> said that Otto
                            von Habsburg had publicly denied recent reports in the Vienna press that
                            he would attempt to enter Austria during the Christmas season. Bielka
                            thought that the Government controversy over Habsburg’s attempts to
                            return to Austria, which reached a crisis stage just before the summer
                            holidays, had subsided markedly since then and that it was unlikely to
                            pose a serious problem for the coalition again in the near future.
                            Agreement of the coalition partners on the budget was a good sign.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName>Bielka</persName> asked about the future of U.S.–USSR
                            relations, the Sino-Soviet controversy, the situation in Laos, and the
                            possibility of a President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"

                                Gaulle</persName> meeting. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR1"
                                >Tyler</persName> thought that Mikoyan’s thumbs-up gesture at the
                            Moscow airport upon his return from President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>’s funeral was significant. The
                            Russians were not given to making such gestures lightly. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had stressed to
                            Mikoyan that he would make unremitting efforts to continue President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>’s policy of seeking
                            peaceful solutions to outstanding problems in U.S.-USSR relations.<note

                            Sino-Soviet differences, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR1"
                                >Tyler</persName> said it was difficult to foresee what the outcome
                            might be. However, he thought these differences involved something more
                            than ideological interpretations. He saw no indications that the gap
                            would be closed appreciably in the near future. With regard to Laos, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName> said that he was not
                            fully current on the situation there since he did not normally have time
                            to read the cable traffic on this subject. So far as he knew, there had
                            been no significant changes in the Laotian situation recently. As for a
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>–General
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> meeting, agreement
                            had been reached in principle that there should be such a meeting, but
                            no details were settled regarding the time or place. President Segni of
                            Italy would pay an official visit to Washington in January and meet with
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>. This visit had
                            been scheduled before the death of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                                >Kennedy</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Replying to a question by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR1"
                                >Tyler</persName>, Dr. <persName>Bielka</persName> said that he had
                            no matters relating to U.S.-Austrian bilateral relations to discuss.
                            When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName> said that he also
                            had no bilateral matters to raise and in passing mentioned the assets
                            problem, Dr. <persName>Bielka</persName> merely nodded. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_PW1">Platzer</persName> asked if Mr.
                                <persName>Mansfield</persName> (IGA) had returned from Europe, where
                            he had gone to investigate the grain diversions. He said that Mr.
                                <persName>Plan</persName>, the Embassy’s Financial Counselor, would
                            like an appointment with Mr. <persName>Mansfield</persName> to be
                            briefed on the progress of the investigation. There followed a brief
                            discussion on the possibility of lifting the suspension on PL480 feed
                            grain shipments to Austria. The recent press articles on the diversions
                            and the interest of Congress in the irregularities, as well as the fact
                            that the investigation had not yet been completed, were cited by <pb
                                n="396" xml:id="pg_396" facs="0418"/>Department officers as
                            impediments to an early lifting of the suspension. Further on
                                Austrian-<gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> relations, in reply to
                            questions by Mr. <persName>Porter</persName>, Dr.
                                <persName>Bielka</persName> said that there were some Austrians who
                            were willing to make a commitment now to the <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                                >EEC</gloss> that Austria would withdraw from the <gloss
                                target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> upon entering an arrangement with the
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. Others, however, were opposed
                            to making such a commitment, in part because they feared it would entail
                            a progressive decline in Austria’s exports to the <gloss
                                target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> countries while the Austrian-<gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> negotiations were still in progress.
                            They feared permanent loss of <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss>
                            markets if the negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                            were unsuccessful. As for the USSR’s attitude toward an Austrian-<gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> arrangement, Dr.
                                <persName>Bielka</persName> said that although it was true that the
                            USSR had not recently reiterated its earlier warnings, there could be no
                            doubt that the Soviets took a serious view of Austria’s entering an
                            arrangement with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. Their recent
                            silence stemmed from the realization that an arrangement was not
                            imminent and their warnings would undoubtedly be resumed if the
                            prospects for an arrangement improved.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary of State opened the meeting by outlining the Berlin problem
                            as it stands today. He said that while there had been talks with
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> there was as yet no
                            blue sky to be seen. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            was continuing to call into question our vital interests on which we
                            could not yield. The Secretary said that if <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> were to continue to press on these vital
                            points, then we were all in for trouble.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said he had the
                            opportunity of hearing Soviet views on Berlin since January 1959, when
                            he talked with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. Since
                            then, he said, he had met <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> again once and had talks with President
                                <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d189fn1">Soviet Premier <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                    >Khrushchev</persName> visited Finland September 2–4, 1960, and
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> visited the
                                Soviet Union November 21–24, 1960.</note> He had tried to find some
                            evidence of change in the Soviet attitude, but in vain, which was no
                            surprise to him.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said there had been some clarification on two procedural,
                            not substantive, points: (a) the Soviets had indicated they were
                            prepared to consider a four-power agreement on access which would not
                            require negotiations with the GDR; (b) they had said there was no
                            “fatal” date for signing a peace treaty. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> had also told him that the
                            Soviets were not prisoners of their own timetable, if there were to be
                            real <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0420"/>negotiations which were
                            not merely a pretext for further delay. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said he had the impression that
                            the Western Powers have not taken the Berlin problem as seriously as
                            they should have since 1959, because <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> had given up his first six-month ultimatum.
                            He said that West Berlin, as such, was not of great importance, but that
                            it was the German question as a whole which was involved. He said he had
                            gained the strong impression, from what <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName> said about the Germans, that the Soviets in
                            fact do fear Germany very much, though they don’t use the word “fear”,
                            and that they are apprehensive about the Germans unleashing another
                            war.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, who joined the
                            conversation at this point, summarized the importance of the German
                            question for the West. He said we had done all we could to integrate the
                            Federal Republic into the rest of Europe, and whatever the outcome of
                            the present crisis, Germany’s ties to the West must not be impaired. On
                            no account should West Germany be neutralized. Thus, said the President,
                            West Berlin was not the sole issue.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said it was easy
                            for Finland to understand the US point of view in this matter. If the
                            West were to give up its position in West Berlin, the result, in so far
                            as Germany was concerned, might well be along the lines mentioned by
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>. He said he had
                            tried to find out from <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>
                            what advantage a separate peace treaty held for the Soviet Union, in
                            view of the fact that it was not possible for it to apply to the whole
                            of Germany. <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> said that
                            one could not be sure, but that he thought there was a 50% to 60% chance
                            that after a separate peace treaty had been concluded, conditions would
                            be clarified in such a way as to lead toward the consolidation of
                            Germany. President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> had
                            then pointed out that the West considered access to Berlin vitally
                            important. <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> had said that
                            the Soviet Union was prepared to guarantee access but that the Ulbricht
                            regime would have to be associated with such a guarantee, since the GDR
                            was a sovereign state.</p>
                        <p>The President pointed out the very great difficulties that lay in the way
                            of recognizing or dealing with the GDR, due to the fact that the Germans
                            would then feel that the prospects of reunification had been fatally
                            impaired. He said our hope was that it might be possible to reach an
                            agreement with the Soviets under which our rights would be
                            unimpaired.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> referred to the
                            difficulties of relations with Eastern Europe. He recalled that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, at the
                            start of his administration, had spoken of liberation of Eastern
                            European countries. However, Germany could not be reunified by
                            force.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> said we could
                            not recognize the GDR. To do so would provoke a very strong adverse
                            German reaction. This could be seen from the effect of the creation of
                            the wall in Berlin on German opinion. <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399"
                                facs="0421"/>He said we did not want a revival of nationalism in
                            Germany. Germany should not be allowed to become isolated, for this
                            would lead to the destruction of freedom in Europe. He said he hoped
                            that the Soviets would be prepared to reserve our rights to access in
                            any agreement, otherwise there might be war.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said the Soviets
                            always use the argument that the West doesn’t really want the
                            reunification of Germany. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                                >Kennedy</persName> said this might be largely true in the case of
                            individual countries, but that it was not the point. He said that
                            Germany was now divided, and that this was a fact. The Soviets were
                            taking an unnecessary risk in trying to force us to associate ourselves
                            formally with them in proclaiming this. To do so would bring about the
                            end of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and of the European
                            Community, and this would mean the end of freedom in Europe. We were of
                            the opinion that a strong Europe was of great help to Finland and that
                            if the West collapsed this would be very harmful to Finland’s own
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said he had been
                            passing on to the President what he had been told from the Soviet side
                            because he thought this would be of interest to us. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> had told him at the conclusion
                            of their talk that when the Soviets had signed a peace treaty with the
                            GDR, the Allies would have to reach an agreement with Ulbricht,
                            otherwise, should they try to pass, the Soviets would shoot down their
                            planes as they did the U–2.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> said we had
                            every intention of upholding our rights. If the Soviets were to follow
                            the course just described, this would mean war. This issue was not like
                            the Laotian problem, for example. It was at the heart of our vital
                            interests, and we could not give way, for if we did, Europe would be
                            gone.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> noted that both
                            sides had remained exactly on the positions they had taken at the start,
                            and that there had been no move forward by either side.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> referred to his
                            talk with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d189fn2">For the memorandum of the President’s conversation

                            the phrase “respect of the sovereignty of the GDR.” He had not defined
                            this further, but this should be looked into to see what it meant. The
                            wall in Berlin had worked to the advantage of the GDR since it had put
                            an end to the flow of refugees. What was needed now was some leadership
                            from the West Germans. This should come from the new government which
                            they were about to form, so that the Germans should themselves accept
                            and share the responsibility of new terms for an agreement, without
                            being able to claim that they had been let down by their Allies.</p>
                        <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0422"/>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said that time
                            was short. He referred to a maxim by Clausewitz to the effect that when
                            there is an issue between one power and a group of Allies, the single
                            power has the advantage because it can decide by itself which
                            concessions it is prepared to make.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> said we were not
                            prepared to grant concessions, in return for which we would merely be
                            given that which we already enjoy, i.e., our rights. Otherwise we would
                            be giving away such things as the Oder–Neisse territories, and the ties
                            of the West with Berlin; and then Soviet pressures would start all over
                            again. This would not be a bargain. As the Secretary of State had said
                            to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, we would be buying
                            the same horse twice. The problem was a difficult one because of the
                            peculiarities of the location of Berlin, but we had to stay there and we
                            hoped the Russians knew it.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said that a
                            foreign newspaperman, who had interviewed him, had blamed him for
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> having become more
                            recalcitrant. He added that, as an outsider, he thought the situation
                            was a terribly difficult one. The question was how could progress be
                            made.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> said that if the
                            Soviet Union would agree to take steps which would improve our rights,
                            we would see on what points we could meet them. He hoped that the
                            Soviets would see this and would agree to reserving Allied rights under
                            any new peace treaty they signed instead of turning them over to
                            Ulbricht. President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName>
                            observed that the Soviets could not fail to go ahead and sign a peace
                            treaty. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> agreed,
                            but said the point was whether the Soviets would reserve our rights in
                            so doing.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said the Soviets
                            frequently defend their position in terms of international law,
                            referring to the sovereign right of nations and to the precedent of the
                            peace treaty with Japan.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> refuted both
                            arguments, saying that the Soviets had no right to give parts of Germany
                            sovereignty. With regard to Japan, the case was entirely different.
                            Japan was not divided and had its own government. If Germany and Japan
                            were to be overrun, the road would lie open to the Soviets and this we
                            could not permit.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said he felt he
                            was in an awkward position because he had been relating what he had
                            heard the Soviets say and it might be thought that this represented his
                            own views, which was not the case. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                                >Kennedy</persName> reassured him. He added that he wished to stress
                            the necessity of the United States meeting its commitments, otherwise it
                            would mean the destruction of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and
                            create a dangerous situation for the whole Free World.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said it was
                            interesting that the United States also believes that the Soviet Union
                            will in any case sign a separate peace treaty with the GDR. The question
                            was: What happens afterwards?</p>

                        <p>Turning to the subject of Soviet resumption of nuclear testing, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said he had told
                                <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> of the bad effect
                            throughout the world which this had created, and had asked him why the
                            Soviet Union had resumed tests. <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName> said that the Soviet Union knew that this was
                            an unpopular thing to do but that it had been considered necessary, and
                            that 30% of the tests (the 13th had just taken place at the time) had
                            now been carried out. President <persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                >Kekkonen</persName> said he had the impression that the resumption
                            of tests had a connection with the German problem. When he had seen him
                            in 1960, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> seemed
                            self-assured and conscious of Soviet power. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said he had the impression that
                            the Russians suffer from an inferiority complex and feel they are not
                            always treated in a manner appropriate to their power and their
                            importance.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> said that in his
                            talks with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> he had
                            sensed two contradictory feelings and attitudes on his part: first, a
                            feeling of not being quite sure of himself, and, second, a feeling of
                            great superiority. It was difficult to balance these two.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> mentioned that
                            the Soviets had been at pain to impress Finnish politicians visiting
                            Russia with the improvement in their conditions of living, and often
                            asked their visitors to see for themselves whether their homes were
                            really as described by the West.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> asked President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> how he saw the future
                            of Finnish relations with the Soviet Union. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said that the economic
                            relationship with the Soviet Union was stable. Exports to, and imports
                            from the Soviet Union were balanced at about 15% of Finland’s total
                            trade. This figure had been made possible by a five-year trade
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what the effect would be on Finland if the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> joined the <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                                >EEC</gloss>. President <persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                >Kekkonen</persName> said that Finland had been satisfied by the
                            terms of her relationship to <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss>, but
                            that if the <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> countries were to join
                            the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, this would create a very
                            difficult situation for Finland. The problem appeared to be
                            insoluble—Finland would have to compete with her competitors on
                            intolerable terms. 35% of Finland’s exports now go to the Common Market
                            countries. In order to meet the competitive terms of the Common Market,
                            Finland would have to resort to measures which would lower her standard
                            of living.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> asked if Finland
                            was in a position where she could sign the Rome treaty now. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> did not reply
                            directly, but referred to difficult political conditions. He said the
                            Soviets had not exerted pressures on Finland.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> asked whether
                            the Soviet Union was satisfied with the present form of government in
                            Finland or would they prefer a <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0424"
                            />Communist regime. President <persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                >Kekkonen</persName> said he thought the Soviets were satisfied, and
                            that their primary consideration was one of security.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> listed the
                            reasons for United States support of the Common Market. He said that it
                            would cost us something in our trade, but would be a stabilizing force
                            for Germany and for Europe if the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> were
                            to join it. He felt sure that the countries involved would recognize the
                            special problems of other countries, for example, Switzerland and
                            Sweden.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said that there
                            was, of course, a great variety of interests involved, and that Finland
                            would have to look after her own. Finland faced the problem of coming to
                            terms both with the Common Market and with the Soviet Union—“That is our
                            Berlin”, he said.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> referred to
                            Finland’s most-favored-nation agreement with the Soviet Union, which had
                            posed a problem for <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. He said this
                            would be compounded if the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> joined the
                            Common Market.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said he hoped
                            the objections which had been formulated to the terms of Finland’s
                            agreement with the Soviet Union were more formal than substantial.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> reiterated the
                            unhappiness which granting <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> treatment
                            to the Soviet Union had created in the United States and said he hoped
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> would make use
                            of this in resisting any attempts at encroachment by the Soviet
                            Union.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the conduct by the Soviet Union of atmospheric nuclear tests,
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> said that it
                            was obvious that they had been preparing them over many months, during
                            which conversations had been going on in Geneva, between the West and
                            the Soviet Union. Being a free society, it was not possible for us to
                            test without inspection, whereas the Soviet Union could. We now faced
                            the situation where the Soviet Union might complete their current series
                            of tests and then call for an unpoliced moratorium on all tests. The
                            President said that the requirements of our security determined that we
                            could not accept this, nor would we go back again to negotiations under
                            a self-imposed ban on testing.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> described
                            Finland’s position today as a happy one compared with what it was in
                            1944. He referred to the agreement reached at Yalta that countries that
                            were neighbors of the Soviet Union should have governments friendly to
                            the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> recalled the
                            Soviet pressures on Finland in 1958, which the Finns referred to as
                            “frosty night”. He asked what the pressures were which the Soviets had
                            applied and what caused them to raise these pressures.</p>
                        <pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0425"/>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said that during
                            his visit to Leningrad in 1959 he had asked <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> the same question. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had said that Finland and
                            the Soviet Union had a common border of 1300 kilometers and thus there
                            was a substantial element of security in their relationship. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had said that certain
                            members of the then Finnish Government had been doing things which
                            impaired this element of security. President <persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                >Kekkonen</persName> said that Finland had complete freedom to
                            decide what government it should have, and that the Soviet Union had
                            made no demands on Finland. However, Finland must take the Soviet
                            position and attitude into account even when she disagrees with the
                            Soviet Union. This was a difficult position for Finland, which, before
                            1940, had always been fully armed to defend itself against the Soviet
                            Union.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> inquired what
                            methods the Soviet Union had used to express its displeasure with
                            Finland.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said that they
                            had recalled the Soviet Ambassador, who had left without saying
                            “good-bye” to the President. Also they had caused trade difficulties.
                            While Finland could have gone on this basis for some months, this would
                            merely have made matters worse economically. Finland’s internal
                            political problems were inevitably related to foreign policy
                            considerations.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> asked how
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> saw the
                            evolution of Communist policies in the next decade.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said that he
                            thought in 30 years time, the capitalist system would gradually be
                            transformed by various modifications and restrictions, and that the
                            Communist system would be progressively liberalized, to a point where
                            both systems would be so close to each other that it would be difficult
                            to know what to quarrel about.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> observed that
                            the problem was how to survive until then. He said he thought that we
                            had witnessed an increasing strength of nationalist sentiment since 1945
                            and that this would prevent a major change in balance of power in the
                            world, if we could prevent problems of the Berlin type from exploding.
                            He said that Central Europe was a vital area, and that the Soviet Union
                            should not push us too hard in such areas.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said he thought
                            the economic systems of East and West were getting closer to each other
                            but that Soviet support and exploitation of nationalist sentiment in
                            areas such as Africa had the effect of increasing Soviet political
                            strength.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> said he felt it
                            was important to support and encourage national sentiment in Africa,
                            even though this occasionally brought us into conflict with some of our
                            European Allies.</p>
                        <pb n="404" xml:id="pg_404" facs="0426"/>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said that so
                            long as countries like South Africa and Portugal pursue their present
                            policies, this conferred a great advantage on the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> said that the
                            problem was a very difficult one. For example, the Azores Base
                            Agreement, which was coming up for renegotiation soon, was of very great
                            importance to the United States, and this had to be borne in mind with
                            regard to Portugal.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said that Egypt
                            herself would not be able to do as much for the Soviet cause in Africa
                            as does Angola. He had become aware during the war how strongly United
                            States policy had worked against colonialism, and he thought this was a
                            wise policy.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> said he felt it
                            was important that the Soviet Union should distinguish between areas of
                            secondary importance and those of primary importance. Even though
                            Finland has problems, he hopes that she would realize that the object of
                            United States policy with regard to Berlin was to keep Europe free, and
                            that although Finland could not herself do much about it, she could
                            understand that her fate was bound up with the outcome of the issue.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said that
                            Finland had a special position with regard to the Berlin problem. The
                            Soviet-Finnish Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Aid of 1948<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d189fn3">For text of this treaty, see 48 UNTS 149.</note>
                            contains a clause whereby Finland was committed to accept Soviet aid, if
                            necessary, in order to repel any attack directed against the Soviet
                            Union across Finnish territory, from Germany or from any powers allied
                            with Germany.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> pointed out this
                            clause was not relevant to the situation with regard to Berlin.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> agreed, but said
                            that, as in the field of trade, we did not want to “anticipate events”
                            (as rendered by the interpreter—in the context the probable meaning is
                            “provoke” rather than “anticipate”). He said that it was an interesting
                            political situation.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> said that the
                            risks and the dangers were equal for all. Both the United States and the
                            Soviet Union were in very great danger. Finland could perhaps be said to
                            be in less danger than we were.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said that in
                            1939 the Soviets had asked for a strip of territory in East Finland in
                            order to safeguard the security of Leningrad. This showed the Soviet
                            Union’s concern for its security. He said that both great powers carried
                            enormous responsibility and that he prayed for success of the efforts to
                            find a solution.</p>
                        <p>The President outlined the various steps which the United States has
                            taken in order to create conditions of peace in the world. However, in
                            areas which were of vital interest to the freedom of the West and the
                                <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0427"/>security of the United
                            States, our stake must be recognized by the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> observed that it
                            was a great pity that the problem of Berlin had been created at the end
                            of the war. Otherwise, he said, the possibilities of stabilization of
                            the situation in Europe would have been greater.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> agreed and said
                            that the circumstances of access to Berlin posed considerable
                            difficulties.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said that the
                            Soviets have declared their plans openly and have committed themselves
                            to them.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> said that it was
                            perfectly possible for the Soviets to sign a separate peace treaty with
                            the GDR which would meet their commitment and would reserve our rights.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> could do this if
                            he wanted to.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said that
                            possibly one way out would be for the United Nations to play a role in
                            the solution. He had mentioned this to <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName>, who had agreed.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> said that when
                            the wall had been built in Berlin, we had not interfered because we
                            recognized that this was a matter of vital Soviet interest. The Soviets
                            had the power, if they so wished, to sign a separate peace treaty, and
                            to limit their objectives. He agreed that certain United Nations offices
                            could be set up in West Berlin, if this would help to bring about a
                            solution, but that we would not accept Soviet troops.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said that
                                <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> had used the phrase:
                            “If the West have ingenious proposals, the Soviet Union would always be
                            prepared to consider them”.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> said we were
                            fully conscious of the danger of the situation and were anxious to find
                            a solution.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said there was
                            at least some hope in the fact that the Soviets had stressed that they
                            were not prisoners of time.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> said he hoped
                            that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was sufficiently
                            interested in the race of production with the United States, which we
                            thought we would win in spite of his claim, to give us all the time in
                            which to decide the outcome. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                                >Kennedy</persName> then asked if there was anything which President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> thought the United
                            States could do to help Finland.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said there were
                            no concrete issues or proposals between us. He appreciated the sympathy
                            and understanding of the United States. He was going to say in his
                            speech at the Press Club on the following day that it was very
                            flattering to Finland to be front-page news.</p>
                        <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0428"/>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> said that he
                            knew that trade was a most important field for Finland.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said that
                            Finland was a capital-hungry country and when Finland accepts credits
                            and loans from others, the Finnish sense of honor requires that these be
                            repaid. As for Finland’s internal problems, he would also ask for
                            understanding with regard to them too. Finland’s wishes were modest; she
                            was not asking for dollars. She wishes to maintain good relations with
                            the United States and thought that the best way to do this was not to
                            take aid from the United States.</p>
                        <p>The President raised the point of certain limiting language in the aid
                            bill with regard to investment guarantees and asked whether there was
                            anything we could do to prevent its working against Finland.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SR1">Seppala</persName> then pointed out
                            that the agreement with Finland involving investment guarantees had been
                            signed just before the amendment to the bill had been introduced.</p>
                        <p>The President said we would look into the possibility of working
                            something out on this point.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said that
                            Finland was considering floating a $10,000,000 bond issue in New York.
                            He said that Finland also had plans to increase the capacity of her wood
                            industry by at least 40% and that this project was being financed
                            largely by Finnish capital. Finland was also receiving some
                            supplementary credits from the World Bank to the extent of
                            $25,000,000.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> turned once
                            again to the question of why President <persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                >Kekkonen</persName> thought the Soviets had not used pressure to
                            overthrow a free society in Finland on their own border when they have
                            repeatedly gone to such efforts and such lengths to expand throughout
                            the world.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said he was
                            convinced that for the Soviets the decisive factor was their security
                            interest. So long as the Soviet Union was satisfied that there was no
                            danger from, or through, Finland, the relationship between the two
                            countries would be stable. However, as soon as the Soviets felt that
                            they might be threatened from that quarter, they reacted.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> observed that
                            with regard to Finland, the Soviets seemed to be following a purely
                            nationalist rather than ideological line.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said that the
                            case of Finland was a special one which Finland herself could not always
                            understand. Ideological factors did not play a major role. For example,
                            the Soviets ignore the Finnish Communist Party and treat it
                            contemptuously. Certain Finnish Communist leaders had recently gone to
                            the Soviet Union and had talks with Suslov which had not gone well, and
                            had made them very unhappy.</p>

                        <p>In conclusion, President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName>
                            expressed his appreciation of this opportunity for a talk with President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, who told him he was

                            Hallama asked that release be postponed until <persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                >Kekkonen</persName>’s return, Finnish Ambassador Moscow failed
                            reach <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. Hallama heard
                            quite by chance through Stockholm that Soviets were releasing note
                            Monday night. He had to release information here regarding note at a
                            time when Finnish Foreign Office had only hastily made translation of
                            note.</p>
                        <p>Hallama has not had time think out implications note but believes it
                            motivated by something more than mere desire accomplishment Soviet aims
                            in Finland. He thinks it part of over-all efforts Soviet Union now
                            making. He notes that except for some criticism of elements in Finland
                            that are not friendly to Soviet Union (this criticism has been made
                            often <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0430"/>before and Finns take its
                            inclusion in note lightly) note contains no strictures against Finland
                            or its government and concentrates its main attacks on Germany, its
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Allies with special attention
                            to Scandinavia. Hallama does not think that Soviets now mean to push for
                            an occupation of Finland or even for bases in Finland. He thinks that if
                            something drastic with regard Finland had been intended it would have
                            been done suddenly when note was presented and points out that note sets
                            no deadline.</p>
                        <p>Hallama thinks Finland should go slowly and play for time while showing
                            enough activity to give Soviets feeling that matter not being taken
                            lightly. He advised President <persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                >Kekkonen</persName> by telephone not to return immediately but to
                            carry on planned program.<note n="2" xml:id="d190fn2"><persName
                                    corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> was in Los Angeles, the
                                final stop on his visit to the United States.</note> In Hallama’s
                            opinion speeding up of return of Foreign Minister, who will arrive
                            Helsinki five this afternoon, is enough evidence for Soviets feel
                            Finland taking matter seriously. Hallama added that he met yesterday
                            with Cabinet to present translation of text not then available and that
                            matter is being reported today to Parliamentary committees.</p>
                        <p>Hallama is convinced that Finland cannot refuse invitation enter into
                            conversations with Soviets or it must do so within framework of “policy
                            of friendliness”. He added that when 1948 Treaty was concluded President
                            Passikivi had said that Article Two would present difficulties of
                            interpretation that would cause problems if consultation were ever
                            demanded. Hallama believes however that accepting invitation consult
                            does not constitute automatic admission contentions of Soviet note.
                            Finns will insist that their territory is not menaced and that Soviet
                            Union is not menaced through Finnish territory. They cannot however deny
                            that war tension exists elsewhere. Hallama will advise President not to
                            go with Finnish delegation to Moscow but to send Foreign Minister and
                            not to include any military men in delegation. Hallama believes that
                            President should at least ini-tially in no way enter directly into
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Finland has been in consultation with other Nordic States and has asked
                            them in their reactions to the Soviet contentions, which it hoped would
                            be prompt and to the point, not to say anything with regard to Finland
                            until Finnish Government had itself made public statement. Hallama
                            expressed gratification with cooperation received this matter. He made
                            particular mention of excellent statement by Swedish Government.</p>
                        <p>Finland realizes that it will have to handle its problem with Soviet
                            Union alone and can hope for sympathy but cannot count on material
                            assistance from outside.</p>

                                specifically mentioned. (Ibid., 375/11–161)</note></p>
                        <p>Emphasizing that he was speaking personally, Mr.
                                <persName>Brimelow</persName> said he gives some credence to
                            reported leaks through Poland to the effect that the Soviets intend to
                            stage a series of crises. He suggested that the Soviets are endeavoring
                            to orchestrate increasing tension, one element of which is to
                            demonstrate a stronger conventional war posture by making troop
                            movements through satellites. He considers this important, and said that
                            the Soviets may wish to move troops into Finland as part of this effort
                            which is designed to bring about negotiations on Berlin. Continuing in
                            this vein, Mr. <persName>Brimelow</persName> suggested that the Soviet
                            note to Finland plays on Scandinavian nerves already frayed by fallout
                            fears, and takes into account lingering Scandinavian doubts and worries
                            regarding Germans. Mr. <persName>Brimelow</persName> suggested that even
                            though Finland may not agree on the alleged threat from the West, the
                            Russians would say that nevertheless they (the Soviets) consider the
                            threat real and accordingly need certain facilities in Finland. (Mr.
                                <persName>Brimelow</persName> was inclined to <pb n="410"
                                xml:id="pg_410" facs="0432"/>think, however, that the Soviets have
                            not made up their minds on how far to go.) Mr.
                                <persName>Brimelow</persName> suggested that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> could reason that, in order
                            to establish the credibility of his own deterrent vis-à-vis the build up
                            of Western conventional forces, he could not leave Leningrad undefended.
                            Thus, if one considers there may not be a nuclear war, it would make
                            sense for <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, in further
                            orchestration of tension, to move troops into Finland. Soviet emphasis
                            on West German militarization, continued Mr.
                                <persName>Brimelow</persName>, illustrates that the rearmament of
                            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is taken seriously by the
                            Soviets.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Brimelow</persName> suggested that the Soviets may wish to
                            do more than use the Note to the Finns for propaganda purposes. The
                            Note, he believes, may be part of a Soviet build up of tension in the
                            crisis on Berlin, and the Soviets probably feel that in this area they
                            can go far with little danger to themselves. Soviet concern with a
                            German threat may, Mr. <persName>Brimelow</persName> continued, be
                            emphasized through actions in Finland in order that the Scandinavians
                            will see that pressure on them, including Finland, can be relieved by
                            negotiations on Berlin. The Scandinavians will thus be induced to place
                            increased urgency on negotiations.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, Mr. <persName>Brimelow</persName> indicated that Prime
                            Minister Macmillan has had a longstanding personal interest in
                            Finland.</p>

                            be conducted.</p>
                        <p>The Finn Government has no idea at the moment what Soviets intend to
                            demand from it.</p>
                        <p>Finland does not feel it is menaced by <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> and does not accept the premises of Soviet note. It
                            does not feel it is militarily menaced by West Germany either, but the
                            “German problem has angles that must be considered in the light of
                            history”. The Germans are an active people and there have after all been
                            two world wars.</p>

                            and optimistic. He hopes that President’s optimism will be justified. As
                            all observers can see, the Finns are keeping cool and have genuine hope
                            that they can arrive at satisfactory solution.</p>
                        <p>I remarked that, as he could see from reception Finnish party received in
                            America, the American people have a very genuine liking for Finland and
                            wish it well and that the US wants nothing from Finland but a genuine
                            maintenance of its neutrality. In reply to this remark, he sighed and
                            said with real feeling, “that is exactly what we want to maintain”.</p>

                        <p>Final decision had not been taken as to how <gloss target="#t_GOF1"
                                >GOF</gloss> will reply to Soviet note, whether by written note or
                            orally through diplomatic channel. Decision will be taken tomorrow. He
                            favors reply by note. Present draft note is short, does not mention
                            Germany, or acknowledge validity Soviet contentions. He hopes that draft
                            will be accepted and that reply will be by note which can be published
                            and will record Finnish Government’s position for benefit other
                            countries and especially of Finnish public. Published note advisable in
                            view rumors to effect that there have been some secret exchanges that
                            are not known to public. If reply is made orally through diplomatic
                            channel, these rumors will tend find even more credence than at
                            present.</p>
                        <p>Finns under no condition refuse to talk but will send to Moscow only
                            small delegation headed by Foreign Minister and consisting entirely of
                            civilians.</p>
                        <p>With regard to source’s statement that no mention of East Germany would
                            be made in note, I remarked that, speaking without instructions and
                            entirely on a basis of personal opinion, I had wondered why reference to
                            West German rearmament and statement this “cause for worry on Finland’s
                            part” had been made in President’s television speech. That seemed rather
                            inconsistent with other statement in this speech that <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is founded on defensive intents. My
                            informant said he could tell me in very greatest confidence that this
                            reference had been added as an afterthought to speech almost at last
                            minute before it was delivered.</p>
                        <p>When taking leave I emphasized that my remarks had been merely personal.
                            He stated that his remarks are equally personal and expressed hope I
                            would not communicate anything we had talked about to anyone else in
                            Helsinki, adding that too many people were running around town repeating
                            things and contributing to increased tensions in atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>It most important that this source be protected.</p>

                                situation with regard to Germany and Berlin seemed to be worse.
                                (Ibid.)</note> Helsinki has been full today and yesterday of rumor
                            and conjecture regarding circumstance surrounding announcement
                            Parliamentary elections. Some persons have contended that main initial
                            purpose Soviet action initiated by October 30 note was to insure
                            re-election <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> and taken for
                            granted that arrangements had been made by him with Soviets before he
                            announced elections. This belief found some support attitude local
                            communist leaders and press who immediately express approval elections,
                            probably for primarily tactical effect locally.</p>
                        <p>Other persons have thought that elections were clever move that would
                            gain time for Finnish Government and have felt that Soviets had enough
                            faith in <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> to approve his
                            action or at least let him appear get away with move.</p>
                        <p>Wishful thinking has prevented most from facing possibility that Finland
                            might be on way to satellite status though some have expressed such
                            fears.</p>
                        <p>Until Wuori arrives and reports, no one here can know for sure precisely
                            what Soviets intend or how far and how fast they mean to go. I believe,
                            however, it unlikely that <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName>
                            had advance agreement from Soviets for Parliamentary elections. Soviets
                            are notoriously and from their point view rightly distrustful such
                            unpredictable things as free and uncontrolled elections.</p>
                        <p>Intention behind Soviet action may have included some small element of
                            desire to help re-election <persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                >Kekkonen</persName>, though that difficult believe in view
                            circumstance his re-election considered almost certain. Main intention
                            must be draw Finland closer into Soviet orbit. It hard to see how this
                            process can be begun without being carried on at accelerating speed.
                            Finnish efforts slow or stop process by holding Parliamentary elections
                            may have been futile and to Soviets provocatory action that may be all
                            more irritating to them because it undertaken by person hitherto
                            regarded as inclined take “realistic and understanding view” their
                            attitudes and wishes.</p>
                        <p>Since Soviet note became known Finnish public on morning October 31
                            sentiment has swung from deepest depression and conviction <pb n="414"
                                xml:id="pg_414" facs="0436"/>that “1939 is here again” to hopes that
                            somehow <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> would save the
                            situation. Reports that Soviets dissatisfied his action and attitudes
                            will send Finnish morale plummeting to bottom. With borders undefensible
                            by comparison with 1939 and an inadequate military establishment, all
                            Finns convinced there can be no question of repetition of 1939
                            resistance. All Finns subscribe to Paasikivi line. If this proves
                            insufficient satisfy Soviets, there is in reality nothing for the Finns
                            to do except realize that degree of independence, if any, that Finland
                            will be able maintain depends entirely on the Russians and not on
                            anything they or the most skillful of Finnish leaders can do.</p>

                            Moscow soon to begin consultations. Wuori asked about meaning of “soon”,
                            at what level the delegation should be and whether it should include
                            military members. Kuznetsov replied that Finnish Government should
                            determine how soon it could send delegation and whether delegation
                            should include military. Without specifying level delegation, Kuznetsov
                            left impression it should be headed by Foreign Minister.</p>

                        <p>Soviets had not given advance commitment to calling elections. Only

                                >Karjalainen</persName> conversations had been following: <persName
                                corresp="#p_KA1">Karjalainen</persName> had said Finnish Government
                            could give guarantee it would maintain present foreign policy up to time
                            of elections. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had
                            remarked with two elections coming up in Finland, one probably as late
                            as next summer, Soviet Government felt that it was being asked to wait
                            too long for definitive guarantee. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> indicated in no way any desire, however, for

                        <p>Hallama feels latest Soviet action should disprove unfair rumors that
                            have had wide circulation particularly in Helsinki that <persName

                            or tied to them by some secret agreements. He believes that it is high
                            time for other parties to rally around <persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                >Kekkonen</persName> and for Honka to withdraw his Presidential
                            candidacy.</p>
                        <p>Finns are faced with disturbing puzzle presented by enigmatic Soviet
                            statement that “if proper political guarantees are given” military
                            consultations may [be] avoided. As late as yesterday afternoon Hallama
                            made further unsuccessful efforts obtain definition this term from
                            Za-kharov. Zakharov implied that it was up to Finland to define terms
                            and to offer guarantees which Moscow would define as acceptable or
                            unacceptable only after they are offered.</p>

                                >Karjalainen</persName> hoped we would not make any strong statement
                            at this juncture. To do so would complicate Finland’s efforts to resolve
                            matters. We told Ambassador we did not contemplate issuing any press

                            Said <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Karjalainen</persName> had sounded
                            cheerful and told him he believed Finnish problem with Soviets could
                            still be settled satisfactorily. Ambassador noted that <persName

                            Ambassador Wuori who was returning from Moscow. Finnish Ambassador

                            seemed to him that Finnish talks with Soviets would have to continue
                            now. ForMin still felt it would be best for Finland to handle situation
                            alone, and that expressions of support from West might make it more
                            difficult for Finns.</p>

                            alone or in cooperation with friendly governments in the face of current
                            Soviet pressures on Finland.<note n="1" xml:id="d198fn1">The enclosures,
                                the paper entitled “U.S. Policy Towards Finland,” a proposed message
                                to President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName>, and a
                                Top Secret Appendix, are not printed.</note> The first and most
                            pressing action recommended is a message from you to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName>. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> is meeting Premier <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in Novosibirsk on November
                            24 and will be leaving Helsinki on November 22 or November 23. Therefore
                            the message should be transmitted today, November 20.</p>
                        <p>The conclusion of our study is that the Finnish-Soviet problem should not
                            be treated as an isolated bilateral matter. If we continue to maintain a
                            hands off position the Soviets are likely to achieve a good portion of
                            their objectives, that is, assuring effective control over Finnish
                            policies; weakening the determination of the Scandinavians to stand up
                            to them; and in general an impairment of free world resolve. Thus we
                            believe it is necessary to accept a confrontation with the Soviets in
                            Finland despite all the advantages the USSR possesses in that area. This
                            would involve a readiness to assist Finland in the political, economic
                                <pb n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0441"/>and propaganda spheres. We
                            believe the Soviets are unlikely in the Finnish context alone to resort
                            to military force. We would continually make clear that our only purpose
                            is to help Finland follow its chosen path of neutrality and
                            independence.</p>
                        <p>The message to President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName>
                            is intended to strengthen his internal fortitude prior to his meeting
                            with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. While he has
                            shown himself in our view overly pliable in the past in relations with
                            the USSR, there seems to be no alternative but to place reliance in the
                            first instance upon him.</p>

                        <p>“On the eve of your departure for Novosibirsk I am sending you this
                            private message so that you may not be in doubt of the position of <pb
                                n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0442"/>the United States. It will
                            receive no publicity whatever in my country, for I am mindful of your
                            desire not to be embarrassed by public comments from others which might
                            be misconstrued as infringements on Finnish neutrality.</p>
                        <p>In our joint communique of October 16 in Washington I expressed American
                            understanding for Finland’s policy of neutrality, our firm intention
                            scrupulously to respect that chosen course, and the necessity for all
                            nations to avoid interference in the affairs of Finland. This remains
                            the basis of the relations between the United States and your
                            country.</p>
                        <p>You will appreciate that our concern in this matter derives not alone
                            from our great interest in the welfare of your country. My Government,
                            and other Western Governments, have accepted Finnish neutrality in all
                            good faith. We have placed on ourselves a solemn obligation to respect
                            that neutrality at all times and in all ways. In our own national
                            interest we have to expect that in turn Finland will in fact be truly
                            neutral.</p>
                        <p>I realize the doubts and anxieties which you and the Finnish people are
                            now suffering as the memories of 1939 return to you. However, today
                            peace prevails and we have in the United Nations a forum where the
                            strength of world opinion is brought to bear against the employment of
                            force. Furthermore given the close interrelationship of all elements in
                            the present world situation, the overwhelming deterrent power of the
                            Free World, of which the Soviet Union is well aware, provides all
                            nations assurance against resort to arms.</p>
                        <p>I want to assure you of the readiness of my country to give Finland our
                            political and economic support. We stand ready to extend commercial and
                            economic assistance in the event of economic pressure against Finland
                            designed to secure political compliance. We are prepared, when
                            opportune, to speak out firmly in behalf of Finland’s security and
                            independence. We would be willing to carry to the United Nations actions
                            seeming to threaten your country’s independence, depriving you of the
                            right to follow your chosen course of neutrality.</p>
                        <p>I am sure that the unity of all patriotic Finns, irrespective of party,
                            when their country is threatened is a great source of strength
                            underlying Finland’s resolve to determine its own destiny.”</p>

                        <p>In US view Soviet objectives in exerting pressures on Finland appear to
                            fall in three general spheres: 1) to assure effective control of major
                            internal Finnish policies and actions; 2) to weaken determination
                            Scandinavian countries stand up to Soviets, in particular to reinforce
                            neutral and pacifist sentiments and to increase anti-German feeling and
                            acceptance of belief that <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is
                            becoming threat to status quo in Scandinavia; 3) to weaken free world

                            continuation policy of intimidation.</p>
                        <p>To accomplish its objectives in Finland Soviets are likely use variety of
                            pressures similar to those applied in 1958 “Frosty Nights.”<note n="1"

                                    because if press were to get wind of your message my position in

                                <item>As I said in my speech Sunday, I will leave with grave
                                    thoughts. We Finns are concerned about outcome of talks, but I

                                    />believe that situation is as serious as President <persName
                                        corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> thinks. Perhaps some of
                                    the press speculation about Finland’s difficulties may have
                                    influenced him.</item>

                                <item>All Finn actions taken since receipt of note have had one aim
                                    in which so far we have not been successful. We want to avoid
                                    military discussions according to Article II of the 1948 treaty,
                                    because that would be tantamount to agreeing that threat
                                    mentioned in note actually exists. That was why we sent
                                        <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Karjalainen</persName> to Moscow.
                                    We wanted to have civilian rather than military delegation, for
                                    latter would have been construed as tacit admission that threat
                                    exists. That was why we decided to dissolve Parliament. I
                                    figured that in this way we could gain a 3-month breather. That
                                    breather lasted only 2 days. Now only remaining alternative is
                                    to send me.</item>

                                <item>I hope that I have necessary arguments to use in my
                                    discussions with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                        >Khrushchev</persName> to convince him that it is in
                                    interests of Soviet Union to permit Finland to retain its
                                    present position. If I can convince him of this and avoid
                                    discussions under treaty, then we will have come out on plus
                                    side. Worst would be if <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                        >Khrushchev</persName> were to insist that Commies be put
                                    into positions of authority here in Finland. I do not think that
                                    this is realistic alternative, but in present situation all
                                    sorts of ideas go through one’s head.</item>

                                <item>If this were to happen, though, and if my policy were to be
                                    shown as unacceptable to Soviet Union, then I will not continue
                                    in this position. One of most difficult statements I ever have
                                    had to make was one in speech November 5 in which I said that if
                                    my policy is demonstrably unsuccessful, then I will resign. I
                                    have worked for fifteen years on assumption that my policy is
                                    right for Finland. If it develops that I have worked in vain,
                                    then I am not going to try to hold onto this job by hook or by
                                    crook. I would consider it my duty to resign and leave the area
                                    if my policy were to fail.</item>

                                    fact be required, because I do not expect any economic

                                    taken out of context, would be unsupportable, but I made them

                                <item>Actually, you know, there is genuine fear in Soviet Union
                                    regarding West Germany. They are afraid that if present
                                    development continues West Germany will be so strong that it
                                    will be able to do what it wishes without worrying about its
                                    allies. This is fear they have, and it is only being realistic
                                    to acknowledge its existence.</item>

                            </list></p>
                        <p>With reference President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName>’s
                            statement regarding West Germany, I remarked that US had not helped form
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and re-armed West Germany to
                            support any military adventures by West Germany or anyone else in <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. I added that West Germany was no
                            longer Germany of Hitler either in size or spirit and that it was
                            contained within framework of its Western alliances. I gave my opinion
                            that Soviets know this and that their expressions of fear represent
                            propaganda rather than reality.</p>
                        <p>I was impressed by real warmth and sincerity with which President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> expressed thanks for
                            attitude of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>.</p>
                        <p>At first glance President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName>
                            looked normal and reasonably cool. He began conversation in controlled,
                            calm manner. When I looked at him more closely, however, I was struck
                            with deterioration his appearance since I saw him at airport when he
                            returned here on November 3. He had obviously lost weight and his skin
                            looked slightly yellow. He looked drawn and heavily burdened with care.
                            As he unfolded his thoughts, particularly when he referred to possible
                            failure policy for which he has worked fifteen years, he revealed strong
                            undercurrent of emotion and some sense of desperation.</p>
                        <p>He aroused in both me and Youngquist of our Embassy, who served as
                            interpreter, feeling of sympathy for sorely tried man, who though he has
                            made mistakes, is nevertheless trying to do what he believes is best for
                            his country.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> is apparently
                            going on his mission intent on playing as his only card himself and his
                            past record of dealing with Soviets and their leader. It is to be hoped
                            that things go as he expects but in the light of the rebuffs experienced
                            by Finns within past two weeks it appears more likely that he may
                            encounter situation beyond his control.</p>

                        <p>Swedish Ambassador Jarring’s reaction was: a) great care must be
                            exercised in any public statements (as GOS is doing) to avoid
                            prejudicing Finland’s position; b) Secy <persName corresp="#p_RD1"
                                >Rusk</persName>’s press conference statement extremely well
                            balanced and widely appreciated in Scandinavia and Finland; c) <gloss
                                target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> already knows it could count on
                            Scandinavian and US support; and d) Swedish thought is to leave further
                            course of action to Finnish judgment.</p>
                        <p>Norwegian Ambassador Koht noted that authoritative comment GON must come
                            from Oslo. On question possible economic support for Finland not sure
                            Norway could help as in sense their two economies were competing ones.
                            Surely there could be no doubt among Finns they had support of their
                            Scandinavian friends. Norway felt that up to this point <gloss
                                target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> had stood up quite firmly to Soviets
                            and GON has had feeling Finns themselves could best handle matter.
                            Ambassador Koht confirmed fact Lange had long talk with <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and also seeing <persName

                        <p>274. Embassy has endeavored on basis information available in Finland
                            assess motives behind present Soviet action against this country. This
                            action might be result mere desire gain control all or part of Finnish
                            territory or at least establish directing influence over policies of
                            Finland. It may look opportune do so while world preoccupied with
                            Berlin, South Asian and other crises synthetically created by Soviets or
                            raised from minor to major scale by their fostering and under shadow of
                            multi-megaton bombs recently exploded. Cynical way in which Soviets
                            showed contempt worldwide public opinion by this latter act augurs ill
                            for Finland.</p>
                        <p>In order better understand what may be principal Soviet motive, brief
                            look at past history may be revealing. In 1939 Soviets using opportunity
                            created by their then ally Hitler began to move against former Russian
                            imperial possessions, Baltic states and Finland. Finns alone
                            successfully <pb n="427" xml:id="pg_427" facs="0449"/>countered this by
                            “winter war”. Following Finnish defeats this war and “continuation war”
                            Soviets probably found it inexpedient take over Finland completely as
                            they needed their forces elsewhere. At end winter war they distrusted
                            their ally Hitler. At end continuation war they were able use Finnish
                            army against Germans in northern Finland and free Soviet troops for
                            drive into Germany. In second instance Soviets were probably limited,
                            partly too by circumstance that British and other allied nations were
                            co-belligerents and parties to peace treaty.</p>
                        <p>That they did not subsequently lose their desire take Finland may be
                            assumed from efforts made 1948 to seize it from within by Communist coup
                            d’etat and by nature their continued support Finnish Communist Party.
                            They may have decided that time is ripe at least begin process making
                            good what they failed do in 1939 and 1948.</p>
                        <p>Following considerations may also have given Soviets motives for
                            action:</p>
                        <p>Prior October 30 principal topic in this part of world was how can <gloss
                                target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> members and affiliates, including
                            Finland, and other neutrals work out some method of association with
                            augmented Common Market. As one observer has said success already
                            attained and hope for future was “making even neutral flags blow
                            westward.” This must have created concern in Soviet Union which
                            doubtless fears integrated Western Europe both as economic power and
                            ultimately as military one. Since West is standing firm in Berlin,
                            Soviet-Finnish treaty may have seemed next best available instrument for
                            pressure on West in general and Scandinavia in particular and good point

                            that they considered the problem to be solved to their entire
                            satisfaction. There had been many interpretations in the press of the
                            results of the Fenno-Soviet talks, and these interpretations had not all
                            been correct. He understood that many journalists are friends of
                            Finland, but their conclusions, however, are not necessarily the right
                            ones.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of his telephone conversation with Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Karjalainen</persName> yesterday, Finland
                            considers the problem solved and does not agree with the point of view
                            expressed by many that the whole matter is still hanging over Finland,
                            so to speak. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SR1">Seppala</persName>
                            referred specifically to the penultimate paragraph of the Novosibirsk
                            communique where <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had
                            stated “that the Soviet Government finds it possible to postpone for the
                            time being the military consultations it had suggested”. Despite
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s use of the word
                            “postpone”, he wished to clarify the Finnish interpretation of this.
                            They interpreted this as meaning that the Soviets of course retained
                            their right to raise this general question again under the 1948
                            Fenno-Soviet treaty. There could have been no question of the Soviets
                            forever renouncing the right to speak of this matter—therefore <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s use of the word “postpone”
                            in the communique.</p>
                        <p>From the Soviet side there had been no pressure nor were there any secret
                            arrangements or requests. President <persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                >Kekkonen</persName> had stated this clearly in his November 26
                            speech to the people of Finland following his return from Novosibirsk.
                            The Finnish Ambassador went on to say that his Government feels that
                            this intermezzo has not changed Finland’s political situation nor has it
                            changed the policy of neutrality which they so sincerely wish to follow.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SR1">Seppala</persName> said that he
                            hoped this would be understood here and in other countries.</p>
                        <pb n="430" xml:id="pg_430" facs="0452"/>
                        <p>The Finnish Ambassador turned briefly to the Fenno-Soviet trade
                            negotiations which had been going on simultaneously. He noted that it
                            was a coincidence that the annual trade negotiations happened to be
                            going on at the same time as the Novosibirsk talks. He stated that these
                            trade negotiations were not at all influenced by the <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                >Kekkonen</persName> talks. There had been absolutely no pressure
                            from the Soviets and the trade arrangements were arrived at as before,
                            through normal negotiations. The Ambassador stated that Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Karjalainen</persName> had told him that
                            the 25 percent increase in Fenno-Soviet trade reported by the press was
                            a slightly high figure, though generally correct. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KA1">Karjalainen</persName> attributed little importance
                            to the “slight increase”. The Finnish Ambassador went on to say that
                            Finland’s trade with the Soviet Union varied between 14 percent and 15
                            percent of the total and has actually diminished in relation to
                            Finland’s over-all trade picture. He wished to make it perfectly clear
                            that the 25 percent increase in Fenno-Soviet trade meant in fact a 25
                            percent increase of 14 percent, and not an increase of 25 percent in the
                            total trade picture. The Ambassador went on to say that the 14 percent
                            size of Finland’s trade with the Soviets was useful, in his opinion. The
                            Ambassador referred very briefly to the Saimaa Canal, stating that these
                            negotiations were going along normally also. (<hi rend="italic"
                                >Note:</hi> This refers to negotiations for possible resumption of
                            Finnish use of this canal which was formerly in Finnish territory before
                            World War II.)</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SR1">Seppala</persName> next turned his
                            attention to the resignation of Mr. <persName>Honka</persName> from the
                            presidential race. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Karjalainen</persName>
                            had told the Ambassador that the Finns had known nothing of this in
                            Novosibirsk until the news came over the wires. Mr.
                                <persName>Honka</persName> had made his own personal
                            decision—admittedly arrived at on the basis of the situation as it
                            existed. Certain Social Democrats had seemed bitter about this,
                            especially as regarded the timing of their candidate’s withdrawal from
                            the presidential race. <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Karjalainen</persName>
                            did not know why he timed his resignation when he did actually—the
                            timing was unfortunate.</p>
                        <p>The Finnish Ambassador next turned to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s comments on certain rightist elements in
                            Finland. He admitted that one could interpret this as interference in
                            Finnish internal affairs. He noted that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> had also mentioned the matter
                            of rightist elements in his speech to the nation. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SR1">Seppala</persName> stated that he was sure we knew
                            who <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was referring to.
                            Mr. <persName>Vaino Tanner</persName>, Chairman of the Social Democratic
                            Party, was by no means a radical, or a Nazi, or anything else bad. He
                            recalled the important and patriotic role Mr.
                                <persName>Tanner</persName> had played during the war years.
                            However, he had come into bad grace—it was too bad but that was a fact.
                            What Finns might think of Mr. <persName>Tanner</persName> did not
                            matter, it was the opinion of their neighbor that was important. That
                            was the brief background to President <persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                >Kekkonen</persName>’s suggestion that certain political leaders
                            step out of the political picture.</p>
                        <pb n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0453"/>
                        <p>The Finnish Ambassador stated that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KA1"
                                >Karjalainen</persName> had told him that there had been no hint
                            whatsoever from the Soviets that they wished to have communists in the
                            Finnish Government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> thanked the Ambassador
                            very much for his extremely interesting presentation of the views of his
                            Government. It of course again raised the question what was the whole
                            purpose of the Soviet exercise. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SR1"
                                >Seppala</persName> answered that the Soviets had used the opening
                            the 1948 treaty with Finland gave them for this move to discuss the
                            threat of war, particularly as it involved Germany. The Finnish
                            Ambassador viewed the note as directed not so much against Finland as in
                            a larger context. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                            agreed, adding that it seemed that Finland was being used. The
                            Ambassador agreed. He noted that they had never expected the Soviets to
                            invoke the 1948 treaty until perhaps some actual shooting had started.
                            The fact that the Soviets had chosen to invoke it under these conditions
                            had admittedly come as something of a surprise to the Finnish
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>The Finnish Ambassador said that as to the communique wording about
                            Finland having to watch the situation in the Northern Europe and Baltic
                            Sea area, he did not believe this was necessarily to the disadvantage of
                            Finland. It could be interpreted that Finland as well as the USSR could
                            have something to say about the situation in the North. The Ambassador
                            again said that they were glad the problem had been settled.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> said that we were also
                            pleased, of course, but not as pleased as Finland seemed to be. He
                            realized that Finland must certainly be relieved. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SR1">Seppala</persName> wondered what we thought of the
                            recent happenings. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                            said that we were also of the opinion that the note had certainly not
                            been directed at Finland alone. It was his own reaction that the Soviets
                            had demonstrated that they could crack the whip. Every Finn, politician
                            or citizen, would have this in the back of his mind from now on. The
                            Ambassador agreed, adding that every responsible Finnish statesman would
                            now also have in his mind more than ever the need to get along with the
                            Soviets. He also agreed that something new had been added to Finnish
                            relations with the USSR.</p>
                        <p>In closing Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> once again
                            thanked the Ambassador for his frank presentation and told him that he
                            would see to it that the Secretary and the President heard of this
                            Finnish assessment of the situation, as they were both much interested
                            in Finland. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SR1">Seppala</persName>
                            said that he believed his account of the Finnish position to be quite
                            accurate.</p>

                        <p>Favorite Soviet tactic is to exert heavy pressure and present exorbitant

                        <p>According to <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName>–<persName

                            reduction in military preparations of Sweden, Norway and Denmark.
                            Warning thus served on Sweden, Norway and Denmark that unless they relax
                            their military posture and attenuate ties with <gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                            “proper” by Soviets.</p>
                        <p>Thus <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should not conclude matter may
                            be left at rest or that Soviets will not resort to further pressures on

                            juncture. Appearance of weakness will only encourage Soviets. Would be
                            grave error in our view to regard situation as hopeless (as done by
                            Boyesen, para 6(b) <gloss target="#t_POLTO1">Polto</gloss> 64). In
                            essential respects situation does not resemble that existing in 1939. We
                            doubt Soviets would be prepared to use military force in Finnish context
                            alone. Given close inter-relationship of all elements in present world
                            situation, overwhelming deterrent power of Free World, of which Soviets
                            well aware, provides all nations assurance against resort to arms. In
                            non-military areas <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> can do much.
                            Efforts will be greatly complicated unless Finns themselves are brought

                            are prepared to stand up to Soviets. Thus first task is to strengthen
                            Finnish resolve. We hope Norway, Denmark and through them Sweden will

                            real gratitude for it. He explained he had tried read it in <hi
                                rend="italic">New York Times</hi> but with his limited English had
                            to give it up. Finnish press coverage had been incomplete and
                            fragmentary.</p>
                        <p>We spent about one hour, mostly on what took place in his conversations
                            with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. Following
                            paragraphs summarize his remarks.</p>
                        <p>On future Finn-Soviet relations he reiterated previous statements that
                            nothing had changed except that deterioration of world situation is
                            reflected in pressure on Finland. If Berlin crisis for example could be
                            settled amicably, Finland could again perhaps live in peace.</p>
                        <p>At this point I remarked that the crisis had been created and was being
                            maintained by the Soviets. The President replied that he understands my
                            views and has heard those of the Soviets and that he in turn has his own
                            separate impressions which may or may not be correct.</p>

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> intimated that
                            he had been more optimistic about peaceful settlement when he spoke with
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and was less so
                            now. When I asked him why he was less so now, and whether it was because
                            of something said to him in Soviet Union, he dodged question and
                            returned to praise of thoroughly good [omission in the source text]
                            balanced and reasonable attitude in the interest of a peaceful
                            settlement of international disputes.</p>
                        <p>In his conversation with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>, Berlin crisis and Finland were not directly
                            linked, although <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> did
                            repeat practically the same words that <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName> used about West Germany and <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He added he had already reported
                            these remarks to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                                >Kennedy</persName> and to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1"
                                >Rusk</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Next he answered my direct questions about what, if any, commitments had
                            been made. First, he said no political commitments were made with regard
                            to Finnish internal affairs nor did he agree sign separate treaty with
                            Ulbricht regime or recognize it, nor were any these matters even brought
                            up by Soviets.</p>
                        <p>Second, no military commitments. President <persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                >Kekkonen</persName>’s tactical plan was to avoid any sentence with
                            the word military in it. If <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> had mentioned military topic he had planned
                            to change subject.</p>
                        <p>I asked him about part of communique which charges Finland with standing
                            on watch in Baltic. He replied that this topic was mentioned only in
                            passing by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. He was,
                            therefore, surprised when Soviets wanted insert it in communique.
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Karjalainen</persName>,
                            Ambassador Wuori and Minister Hallama had got together with Soviets
                            write up communique after talks. Minister <persName corresp="#p_KA1"
                                >Karjalainen</persName> came to President <persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                >Kekkonen</persName> to ask what should be done. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> told him if Soviets insisted on
                            proposal, accept it. His reason was that he felt this might imply Soviet
                            acceptance of Finnish interpretation Article 2 of friendship treaty.
                            Finns contend that both parties must agree that threat exists. Secondly,
                            this item which calls for Finland follow events in Baltic now leaves
                            initiative for military consultations up to Finns. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> considered this victory, but
                            added he knew there would be wrong interpretations in Scandinavia which,
                            he said, would disappear with time.</p>
                        <p>No economic matters were discussed.</p>
                        <p>He speculated on what might have been Soviet motive for sending October
                            30 note and said that he believes it directed against <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, Sweden and to lesser extent Finland.
                            If <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> just made a speech
                            or had directed some complaint to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>,
                            it would have been quickly forgotten. On contrary by directing request
                            for consultations to Finland they had aroused world attention. Article
                            II of the friendship treaty was <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438" facs="0460"
                            />available for use and they used it with unfortunate results for
                            Finland but <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> does not
                            care about those.</p>
                        <p>As to Finland’s future: Finland must continue to watch situation closely,
                            keep steady nerves and make each move with an eye to next one Soviets
                            may make and trust that its moves are the right ones.</p>
                        <p>I asked President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> if he
                            though Communists would be taken into next government. He said he does
                            not think so; but, whether they are or not, depends primarily on the
                            SKDL’s relations with other parties; that is, whether other parties will
                            cooperate with them.</p>
                        <p>I asked him whether the Communists lose votes next Diet elections. He
                            answered no, they have about one-half million votes upon which they can
                            count. These voters stuck with SKDL through Stalin’s time and Hungarian
                            revolution, so does not think note from Soviet Union will affect number
                            who turn out at the polls in February. He said Communists have profited
                            from nine months in which Honka was Social Democratic candidate because
                            they were able attack Social Democrats full force for nominating
                            reactionary. Situation is better with Social Democrats now that they
                            have a new candidate.</p>
                        <p>President was relaxed and friendly but not up to his top physical form as
                            he has just recovered from an illness which struck him immediately after
                            his television and radio speech. He attributed his illness particularly
                            to relaxation of nervous tension thereafter.</p>
                        <p>Frank Friberg who acted as interpreter and I believe that President

                            warranted. We believe his efforts explain and justify inclusion in

                            January 2 and we talked for about fifty minutes. Nothing of much
                            significance emerged, but there were a few points which give useful
                            indications of his thinking.</p>

                            <item>I began by stressing that I was not speaking on instructions but
                                wanted to review the situation with him. For the first ten or
                                fifteen minutes he said little more than his usual line in public,
                                and in describing his conversations with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                    >Khrushchev</persName> emphasized the hostility the Russians had
                                expressed to certain political circles in Finland. This was a fact
                                of life which he must take into account.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Ipressed him to say whether he expected the Russians to renew
                                their request for military talks. While admitting that they could do
                                so at any time (next time if they liked without a note), he
                                persistently expressed confidence that the request would not be
                                renewed in the near future at all events. He emphasized the value of
                                the last sentence of the Novosibirsk communique as leaving the
                                initiative with Finland, and he confirmed, when I asked him about
                                the point, that Finland could still contest whether a situation
                                justifying the formal invocation of the 1948 Pact existed. But he
                                admitted that next time, should the Russians really press hard for
                                military consultations, it might prove impossible to avoid
                                them.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>I asked him whether he was satisfied that the general line of
                                silence and official unconcern taken during November by friendly
                                Western governments had been the best from Finland’s point of view.
                                He said he was, instancing something he had said to Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> in America to the effect that
                                Finland must be left to deal with her problems alone. He referred
                                also to the Swedish Prime Minister’s statement about the maintenance
                                of Swedish neutrality. He knew that Mr.
                                    <persName>Erlander</persName> had been criticized for this
                                statement, and it had been argued that on the contrary Sweden should
                                have said that Soviet action against Finland would lead her to
                                abandon neutrality. But he thought this would have made things worse
                                not better for Finland. I said that while I understood his point of
                                view, if the world at large maintained an indifferent silence the
                                Russians might feel no one would object if they absorbed Finland
                                completely. The President said he was well aware of this
                                consideration.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>I told the President that all Finland’s friends realised the
                                difficulty of her situation and no-one could easily suggest a
                                satisfactory alternative <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440" facs="0462"
                                />policy. But I assumed that Finnish policy, while concerned not to
                                provoke the Russians, to conciliate them as far as possible and to
                                deserve their confidence, must nevertheless contemplate that there
                                was a certain point beyond which Finland would not be driven without
                                resist-ance. It seemed to me that Finland must be prepared to
                                contemplate the possibility of having a period of bad relations with
                                the Soviet Union. Other countries had had such periods of bad
                                relations and had survived them. The President replied that there
                                was indeed a point beyond which Finland could not go. But he hoped
                                and believed that the Russians would not press them as far as this
                                point.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>I reminded the President that I had been instructed in November to
                                inform him of my Government’s support for Finnish neutrality. For my
                                part, I felt it was essential that the nature of its neutrality
                                should be defined by a neutral government itself and by no-one else.
                                The President said that was indeed so, but the government then had
                                to satisfy itself that those concerned agreed with its definition. I
                                said this seemed to me dangerous. If under pressure from one side
                                neutrality were extended in one direction it might cease to look
                                like neutrality from the other.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>Turning to internal affairs, I reminded the President that in his
                                New Year speech he had said the country’s greatest need was for an
                                effective majority government after the elections. What kind of
                                Government did he think might then be formed? He said he believed
                                the elections would produce a bourgeois majority (i.e. a majority of
                                parties other than Communists, Social-Democrats and Skogists). From
                                his point of view the ideal government after the elections would be
                                one composed of the Agrarians and both the elements into which the
                                Social Democrats were now split. He agreed with me that Social
                                Democratic unity could not be established before the elections.
                                (What he has in mind, presumably, is the possibility that it may be
                                established after the elections by the withdrawal or ousting of the
                                group now in control of the Social-Democratic Party (i.e. Tanner and
                                his associates) and the emergence of a new dominant faction—perhaps
                                led by Paasio, now the Socialist candidate for the presidency—which
                                will be able to heal the breach with the Skogists.) The President
                                added that if such a Government could be formed, then he hoped it
                                would be possible to form a bourgeois coalition (i.e. Agrarians,
                                Conservatives and minor centre parties).</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>I told the President I was glad to hear what he said about a
                                possible future government, as naturally I shared the widespread
                                concern lest the next Finnish Government should include Communists.
                                If it did, then Finland’s relations with her Western friends were
                                bound to suffer. And once Communists got into a Government it might
                                not be easy to get them out. Finland had got Communists out of her
                                Government in 1948, but she might not be able to do so again. The
                                President replied with apparent <pb n="441" xml:id="pg_441"
                                    facs="0463"/>confidence that he did not think it likely there
                                would be Communists in the next Government. He did not expect a
                                Communist success in the elections. And even if they did win a few
                                seats this would not be of real political significance. Anyhow, no
                                other party was ready to collaborate with the Communists, and that
                                alone probably settled the matter.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>In thanking the President for receiving me I said I hoped that, if
                                difficult times for Finland should return, the Finnish Government
                                would be prepared to take friendly Western governments into its
                                confidence as to its hopes and fears. I felt sure he realised that
                                my Government at all events would treat whatever the Finnish
                                Government told us with discretion. The President replied rather
                                half-heartedly that he would always be glad to let us know about his
                                problems.</item>

                        <p>I lunched with the Finnish Ambassador at his invitation.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador indicated that he wanted to talk with me about
                            Finnish-Soviet relations on the basis of a personal letter from
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> and on the
                            President’s specific request that he relay these observations to “his
                            friend <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>.” Following are the
                            highlights of the fairly long communication as related to me by the
                            Ambassador.</p>

                            <item>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> had
                                appreciated Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GB1"
                                >Gufler</persName>’s call on him prior to his visit to the USSR, and
                                the US offer of help put forward by the Ambassador. However he had
                                felt it was essential that Finland stand on its own feet and try to
                                solve its own problems.</item>

                            <item>The President was rather upset that we had told the Swedes about
                                our demarche to him. [<hi rend="italic">2–1/2 lines of source text

                            <item>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> had made
                                practically a lifetime study of the Soviets and Soviet-Finnish
                                relations. He felt that he knew how to deal with them and was sure
                                that Finland was better off if it handled the problems connected
                                with this relationship alone.</item>

                            <item>The President was satisfied that the talks with <persName

                                for Finland. He wanted the point made that <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had not insisted on any
                                political changes inside Finland and had not told him to make the
                                statement which he did make in his TV address on his return about
                                other Finnish politicians stepping out of the way.</item>

                            <item>The President had been made aware of what the defector from the
                                Soviet Embassy in Finland had been saying and it was
                                nonsense.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>I replied at some length after expressing appreciation for the
                            President’s communication and my conviction as to his sincerity.
                            Following are the main points I made in response to the numbered points
                            above.</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>(1)</label>
                            <item>I pointed out that we had shown great restraint, even though the
                                Soviet communication to the Finns had contained malicious and
                                distorted statements with respect to <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                    >NATO</gloss> to which we would normally <pb n="443"
                                    xml:id="pg_443" facs="0465"/>have replied forcefully and
                                promptly. We had in fact refrained from doing so. Our offer to help
                                had been a very sincere indication of our interest and concern and
                                our desire to strengthen the Finnish position.</item>
                            <label>(2)</label>
                            <item>I pointed out that informing the Swedes had seemed most natural to
                                us. The Scandinavians themselves had set the pattern in this respect
                                by their close relationships and we made it a practice to inform
                                them of our moves in their area. Moreover I commented that even if
                                this had become known to the Soviets I found it hard to understand
                                why it would have embarrassed or weakened President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName>’s position to have it known
                                to the Soviets that outside powers were interested and
                                concerned.</item>
                            <label>(3)</label>
                            <item>Continuing this same line I pointed out that in fact a small weak
                                country like Finland was at a considerable disadvantage in
                                negotiatiating with a great power like the Soviet Union not renowned
                                for its restraint. It was dangerous to think that a small power
                                could in fact hold its own in this situation and I would think it
                                would welcome having its hands strengthened.</item>
                            <label>(4)</label>
                            <item>Repeating that I had great understanding for the difficult
                                situation Finland is in, I said I would again remind the Ambassador
                                of what I had often said to him. We did not object to reasonable
                                accommodation on the part of the Finns to the facts of this
                                situation. However we did beg them not to “kid themselves.” I did
                                not see how it could be denied that with this move the Soviets had
                                in fact interfered in a most serious way in Finland’s internal
                                affairs. Moreover President <persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                    >Kekkonen</persName> had gone quite a ways in his public
                                statement on his return toward accepting the thesis of the German
                                menace and agreeing to be responsible for keeping his eye on
                                developments in this connection. I then asked the Ambassador how the
                                acute German crisis portrayed in the Soviet note to Finland could be
                                reconciled to Moscow’s current flirtation with the Federal Republic
                                and desire to enter direct talks and improve relations—a point which
                                impressed him very much.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he would also be speaking to Deputy Under
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> on this
                                subject.<note n="1" xml:id="d211fn1">The Department of State

                        <p>Addendum—February 6</p>
                        <p>I called Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SR1">Seppala</persName> today
                            to express my pleasure and congratulations on the outcome of the Finnish
                            elections. He indicated that he was also pleased and greatly relieved.
                            He thanked me for the call and for the conversation yesterday.</p>

                        <p>Evidence suggests Bjorkenheim may well have approached Soviets on
                            question of raising these limitations. Finnish military has long had
                            this objective. This is first time Finnish purchases of Soviet arms
                            negotiated by Cabinet Minister. Moreover, we understand [<hi

                            that Bjorkenheim explored amendment of peace treaty military provisions
                            prior to his departure for Moscow.</p>
                        <p>Source may be correct regarding types of equipment to be purchased. No
                            previous indication here, however, Bjorkenheim group intended purchase
                            anti-aircraft guns and radar from Soviets. Finns have, however,
                            previously shown interest in anti-aircraft missiles.</p>
                        <p>Of $125 million Soviet credit, about 50 percent has been allocated
                            Finnish military. This includes latest $37.5 million allocation.
                            According best available information, approximately $25 million of
                            original $125 million credit remains unallocated and could be made
                            available for additional military or other purchases.</p>

                            government had acceded to request presented by President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> when he visited London last
                            spring that it “close its eyes to enlargement in size Finnish armed
                            forces above maximum fixed by Paris Peace Treaty”. British agreement
                            conditional on Finnish assurance that Soviets are also willing “close
                            their eyes”.</p>
                        <p>British Government has not, however, consented to <persName
                                corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName>’s other request that it permit
                            “re-interpretation of treaty to allow Finnish equipment with guided
                            missiles”. London felt last May and gives evidence of still feeling that
                            it would be contrary to principle of sanctity of treaties to acquiesce
                            to this request under fiction of “re-interpretation” of treaty. London
                            apparently believes that for this alteration in treaty Finns should
                            approach all signatories and secure proper legal waiver of
                            conditions.</p>
                        <p>British Embassy has been requested by Finnish Government consent to visit
                            to London by Bjorkenheim, Finnish Defense Minister, and has been told
                            that he will take up in London re-interpretation of treaty to permit
                            guided missiles to which Soviets have already given their consent during
                            recent Bjorkenheim visit in Moscow. (Soviets have also offered supply
                            missiles.) British Ambassador has forwarded Finnish request with
                            favorable recommendation.</p>
                        <p>He hopes that London will at least allow visit though it has shown itself
                            reluctant do so. He has no reason at moment to believe London disposed
                            change its attitude re guided missiles though he hopes it will. I
                            believe he may fear that if British consent is withheld, Finns will not
                            bother with lengthy and possibly complicated efforts revise treaty
                            legally with consent all parties but will, with Soviet connivance and
                            even maybe under Soviet pressure, simply ignore it.</p>

                                representatives explained their rationale for reinterpretation of
                                the 1947 Paris Peace Treaty with Finland. (Ibid.,
                                660E.611/2–2162)</note> Agree with reasoning of British Ambassador
                            Helsinki. Finnish military is firmly anti-Communist in sentiment. It
                            needs modern arms to make it even defensively effective and to maintain
                            its self-confidence.</p>
                        <p>Do not agree with British Ambassador Moscow. Evidence indicates
                            initiative for reinterpretation of treaty arms limitations came from
                            Finns. Finns have long been anxious secure modification arms limitations
                            in order build military establishment which they could convincingly
                            assert has capacity prevent use Finnish territory against USSR without
                            need of Soviet aid envisioned by Finno-Soviet mutual assist-ance treaty.
                            Finns have regarded Soviets as principal obstacle to modification arms
                            limitations and have several times sounded them out on matter. First
                            Soviet resort to mutual assistance treaty in October 30 note increased
                            Finns anxiety and, we believe, shocked them into approaching Soviets
                            again on revision of limitations.</p>
                        <p>Do not agree Finnish arms build-up would tend suggest Finnish concurrence
                            in Soviet thesis USSR threatened by West Germany via Finland. Finnish
                            effort to clear way for build-up preceded development Soviet thesis.

                            because of West German threat.</p>
                        <p>Possible Soviet pressure for incorporation of Finnish and Soviet early
                            warning systems unrelated to modification arms limitations, since early

                            consent, but believe it in Finns own interest to approach all treaty
                            signatories to secure proper legal waiver of limitations as British

                                    >Johnson</persName></hi>: The Department of Defense has reviewed
                            your letter of 1 March 1962, and its accompanying enclosure, concerning
                            possible revision of the Finnish Peace Treaty of 1947.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d217fn1">Not printed. (Ibid., 033.60E41/2–2662)</note>
                            Defense views on this general subject are as follows.</p>
                        <p>The basic objective of the United States with respect to Finland
                            continues to be an independent, democratic and Western-oriented Finland
                            as free as possible from vulnerability to Soviet pressures. Soviet
                            domination of Finland could put the USSR in control of advance air
                            defense and early warning positions and additional Naval bases in the
                            Baltic. In addition, such domination would be a heavy blow to Western
                            morale and could weaken the resistance of some other small Free World
                            nations to Soviet Bloc pressures. The continued denial of Finland to the
                            USSR thus is both militarily and psychologically important to the
                            West.</p>
                        <p>From the military point of view, the acquisition by Finland of guided
                            missile weapons and an early warning radar system is not in the best
                            interest of the United States. The Department of Defense, on the advice
                            of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, therefore recommends that Article 17 of
                            the Finnish Peace Treaty not be interpreted or revised to permit such
                            acquisition by Finland.</p>
                        <p>Specific answers to the questions raised in your letter, as well as a
                            strategic appraisal of the military importance of Finland, are attached
                                hereto.<note n="2" xml:id="d217fn2">JCSM–168–62, not

                            supporting amendment Finnish Peace Treaty.</p>
                        <p>Summary follows:</p>
                        <p>Subject has undergone serious study within US Government and views of
                            Defense Department and Joint Chiefs have been obtained on military
                            aspects. Central question is whether Finland’s independence and freedom
                            action will be enhanced or reduced by action taken on Finnish request
                            acquire modern guided weapons system either through Treaty
                            reinterpretation or amendment. Question also arises whether strategic
                            position USSR will be advanced by readier Soviet access to Finnish early
                            warning system and air defense capabilities. In Department’s view either
                            tacit or formal acquiescence in Finnish request could very well weaken
                            Finland’s position and offer USSR strategic advantages.</p>
                        <p>Finnish authorities both political and military assert that if Finland
                            better armed it could be argued Article 2 of 1948 Fenno-Soviet Treaty
                            need not be invoked since Finland would be capable taking care of its
                            own defense and maintaining its neutrality. This viewpoint rests on two
                            premises of dubious validity: first, Soviet motives for note October 30
                            were of purely military nature, and second that Finnish defenses could
                            be strengthened to point of reassuring Soviets re their allegations of
                            aggressive intent of West Germany and its allies.</p>
                        <p>There ample evidence that provision such highly sophisticated equipment
                            as presently envisaged would require considerable assist-ance to Finnish
                            military by Soviet technicians. Such system would not only be readily
                            adaptable for joint use but also increase dependence of Finnish armed
                            forces on USSR. Finns would accordingly be forced into closer military
                            relationship with USSR with resulting opportunities for greater Soviet
                            influence over Finnish armed forces.</p>
                        <p>Opportunities for development useful contacts between British and Finnish
                            military not present to same extent in terms British equipment <pb
                                n="452" xml:id="pg_452" facs="0474"/>in which Finns have expressed
                            firm interest. Radar to be purchased by Finns from United Kingdom
                            together with modern air defense weapons from USSR would give Finland
                            beginning of highly sophisticated air defense weapons system control of
                            which would be tempting political and military objective to USSR. USSR
                            would have opportunity extend its air defense system several hundred
                            miles westward to detriment <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. While
                            Finnish military authorities would probably resist such Soviet endeavors
                            Finnish political leadership would be determining factor. Events since
                            October 30 do not provide grounds for confidence in willingness or
                            ability present Finnish leadership withstand dangerous accommodations
                            with USSR. No assurance modern air defense weapons on Finnish soil would
                            not be used against West.</p>
                        <p>Possibility Finns may in any case purchase Soviet missiles in breach of
                            Peace Treaty cannot be excluded. However such step in complete disregard
                            views friendly Treaty signators would be drastic and would demonstrate
                            that Finnish independence and national will had already become seriously
                            compromised and weakened. This in itself would justify decision not
                            proceed favorably on Finnish request.</p>
                        <p>Department therefore believes reinterpretation or revision Peace Treaty
                            would not be in best interest of West and accordingly hopes <gloss

                                >Alex</persName></hi>: The Department of State has requested Defense
                            concurrence in the attached draft Presidential Determination<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d219fn1">Not printed.</note> authorizing expenditure of up
                            to $10 million to permit the armed forces of Finland to purchase United
                            States military equipment in FY 1962 at reduced cost.</p>
                        <pb n="453" xml:id="pg_453" facs="0475"/>
                        <p>The Department of Defense considers the provision of limited U.S.
                            military assistance to Finland, including classified equipment on a
                            case-by-case basis, to be militarily desirable. We are concerned,
                            however, that any U.S. military equipment provided to Finland should not
                            be of such a nature that it could be used to any significant extent
                            against the West. Accordingly, all sales should be effected on a
                            case-by-case basis, in light of security classification, availability,
                            and after a careful appraisal of the potential value of the specific
                            item in countering U.S. or Allied war plans.</p>
                        <p>It is now recommended, however, that the proposed assistance be funded in
                            FY 1963, rather than FY 1962 as originally suggested, since there is
                            little likelihood that any sales could be negotiated and completed
                            before 30 June 1962.</p>
                        <p>Subject to the foregoing qualifications, the Department of Defense
                            concurs in the draft Presidential Determination, dated 1 March 1962,
                            which has been forwarded to us. A copy is attached for your
                            reference.</p>

                            facilities which Finns now have or are acquiring would give Soviet Union
                            certain advantages, but <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> also notes
                            that acquisition such radar facilities and fighter aircraft not
                            prohibited by Peace Treaty. Question therefore is to what extent
                            acquisition of surface to air missiles, which are prohibited, would
                            enhance advantages to Russians and disadvantages to <gloss

                            of Finnish air defense system must be viewed with concern, <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> of opinion that effect of acquisition
                            even in worst case would be comparatively small. Furthermore <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> understands Finns plan purchase some
                            missiles from <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, thus providing
                            opportunities for establishment useful contacts between <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Finnish military which should help
                            counterbalance Soviet-Finnish contacts.</p>
                        <p>Regarding central political question of preservation Finnish
                            independence, Finnish case is simply that effective defense of Finnish
                            neutrality no longer possible without up to date defensive equipment.
                            Peace Treaty was signed at earlier stage of technological development
                            defensive weapons and includes provision for modifications. If matter
                            came up in UN many other governments might take view it unreasonable for
                            co-signatories refuse modification.</p>
                        <p>Not possible give definite reply to question whether Finland would ignore
                            a British refusal to agree to reinterpretation or amendment of Peace
                            Treaty. Finns might drop their proposals if British concurrence not
                            given and <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> now understands this is
                            their intention. Political consequences British refusal would be
                            serious. Such decision would seem unreasonable, would lead to loss
                            Finnish confidence in West, and would cause inevitable decline in morale
                            Finnish armed forces. Finnish Govt might however disregard <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> refusal particularly in event Soviet
                            pressure for consultation under 1948 Fenno-Soviet Agreement coupled with
                            pressure to integrate Finnish defense system with that of Soviet Union.
                            In <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> opinion it would be easier for
                            Finland to reject such demand if Finnish defenses already included some
                            modern equipment and if she retained some confidence in West which would
                            be gravely impaired by British refusal her present request.</p>

                        <p>6212. For Ambassador from Secretary. Deliver following personal message
                            from me to Lord <persName corresp="#p_HAFD1">Home</persName>:</p>
                        <p>“Dear Alec: As I promised in Athens, I have carefully looked into the
                            difficult question of permitting Finland to acquire guided missile
                            weapons through a revision of the Finnish Peace Treaty.</p>
                        <p>Although we are not a party to the Treaty, and your Government is the
                            principal Western signatory, I have appreciated the opportunities to
                            exchange thoughts on the subject with you. As you know my initial
                            reaction as expressed to Ambassador Ormsby Gore on March 10 was against
                            a Treaty revision. Now, after a careful reexamination of the subject, I
                            have again concluded that the proposed revision of the Finnish Peace
                            Treaty would be contrary to the best interests of the West. Officials in
                            the Department of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and I all take the
                            view that acquisition by Finland of guided missile weapons would be both
                            militarily and politically unwise. The military aspects strongly
                            indicate, in our opinion, that the strategic position of the West would
                            be adversely affected.</p>
                        <p>I am aware of how delicate a matter of judgment is involved in assessing
                            the political aspects of determining whether the Finns should have these
                            guided missiles. On the basis of all the information we have I am left
                            with no alternative but to conclude that the political results would not
                            be helpful to us. I question, on the basis of the review I have had
                            made, that the acquisition of a modern air defense capability would give
                            the Finns added confidence and political strength to resist
                            encroachments by the Soviet Union. I am not sure but that, on the
                            contrary, this might well give the USSR political as well as military
                            advantages.</p>
                        <p>If Finland were to acquire such modern weapons the political and military
                            position of our other friends in Northern Europe would be directly
                            affected. I understand that you have not discussed this matter with
                            Norwegian, Danish and Swedish authorities. I recall that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> told Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> at Novosibirsk last November
                            that a further build-up of armed forces in Northern Europe could be
                            avoided if the USSR withdrew its demands on Finland. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> thereupon temporarily
                            withdrew his demands.</p>
                        <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0478"/>
                        <p>I am informed that the Bloodhound I and Thunderbird I missiles contain
                            components incorporating United States classified information. I am
                            quite sure that we could not agree to making the classified aspects of
                            these weapons available to Finland.</p>
                        <p>Let me assure you that, although my conclusions differ from those you
                            have made, I have studied this problem thoroughly and carefully.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SR1">Seppala</persName> opened the
                            conversation by reading the text of a memorandum giving the
                            considerations which prompted the Finnish Government to seek a
                            reinterpretation of the Finnish Peace Treaty in order to acquire guided
                            missile weapons (a copy of the memorandum is attached).<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d222fn1">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SR1">Seppala</persName> commented that
                            Finland had available for military purchases a Soviet credit of some 12
                            billion Finnmarks, of which only a quarter, or 3 billion Finnmarks,
                            would be used for the purchase of Soviet guided missiles. The Finns
                            would, the Ambassador said, pay the full price, and the quantity of
                            missiles acquired would accordingly be relatively small. The purchase of
                            guided missiles from the USSR was initiated by the Finnish Defense
                            Forces; the Soviets have not tried to sell such weapons to Finland and
                            there has been no collaboration between the Finns and the Soviets in
                            this matter. Missiles would, the Ambassador continued, also be purchased
                            from the United Kingdom, provided funds were allocated in the next
                            budget. The Ambassador <pb n="457" xml:id="pg_457" facs="0479"/>said the
                            entire matter was of the greatest importance in order for Finland to be
                            able to defend its own frontiers and its neutrality. Without such
                            weapons, he said, Finland would be a military vacuum in time of war, or
                            during periods threatening wars; such vacuums were invariably filled.
                            The Ambassador expressed the hope that the U.S. Government would take an
                            understanding view of Finland’s desires and interests.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked what kind of missiles the Finns were interested in
                            acquiring. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SR1">Seppala</persName>
                            replied that it was his understanding that air defense missiles would be
                            purchased from the Soviet Union, and anti-tank missiles from the United
                            Kingdom. However, he repeated that the current budget did not have an
                            allocation for the purchase of British missiles. The Ambassador then
                            went on to explain the origin of the Soviet commercial credit, and the
                            difficulties the Finns had encountered in making use of it.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SR1"
                                >Seppala</persName> at whom the Finns expected to shoot their
                            missiles. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SR1">Seppala</persName>
                            explained that it was important for Finland to be able to defend its
                            neutrality so that, under existing treaty arrangements, the Soviets
                            could not say that the Finns could not defend themselves. The Ambassador
                            commented briefly on the 1948 Finnish Treaty with the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then asked if the Ambassador could explain why the Soviets
                            were interested in selling the Finns guided missile weapons. The
                            Ambassador replied that the Soviets had agreed to sell war materials to
                            Finland, but that the Finns had taken the initiative to acquire guided
                            missile weapons. However, it was difficult, he continued, to say what
                            the Soviet motives were. The Ambassador reiterated that it was important
                            for Finland to be able to say that it was able to defend itself and
                            maintain its treaty obligations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said it was difficult to understand, and in his own mind he
                            wondered, why the Soviets would be willing to sell such weapons to
                            Finland unless they were convinced they would be shooting in only one
                            direction. The Ambassador replied that, on behalf of Finland, he could
                            say definitely that Finland would not shoot the weapons unless Finnish
                            soil was molested. He alluded again to Finnish obligations under the
                            1948 Treaty.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked the Ambassador to comment on whether Finland was as
                            independent and neutral today as at the time of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName>’s visit to the United States
                            last October. The Secretary noted that the Soviet Union had made certain
                            requests of Finland at that time. The Ambassador replied, “Yes,
                            absolutely.” The Ambassador then went on to talk briefly about
                            Finnish-Soviet trade balances, and Finland’s need to maintain a posture
                            which was not unfriendly to the USSR. He <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458"
                                facs="0480"/>said, with respect to the Helsinki World Youth
                                Festival<note n="2" xml:id="d222fn2">July 29–August 6.</note> for
                            example, the Finnish Government had been obliged to bend in the
                            direction of Soviet interests; Finnish policy had not, however,
                            changed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that when the USSR presented its note to Finland last
                            October the problem seemed to be a matter of great urgency and
                            importance. Yet, after Finnish officials visited the Soviet Union, the
                            public results seemed very meager. Why, the Secretary asked, had the
                            Soviets been willing to settle for so little publicly when the matter
                            had originally seemed so important? Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SR1">Seppala</persName> replied that the Soviets had
                            achieved their objectives of shaking up the Scandinavians in a matter
                            which was related at the time to the Berlin situation. Finland was an
                            area of maneuver for the Soviets. It is also well to remember, he said,
                            that Finland is bound by treaty arrangements which place very narrow
                            limits on Finnish policy. <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName>
                            apparently persuaded <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            to lift his demands on Finland. Admittedly, he said, the affair had
                            helped re-elect <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> President
                            of Finland. It was difficult, he said, to understand Soviet motives.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said the Finns were proposing to acquire sophisticated
                            guided weapons from two sides. Such weapons contained highly classified
                            information. As yet such classified information had not crossed the
                            curtain. There was, therefore, the problem of technical security. In
                            addition to this technical problem there was the political question of
                            how all this related to the neutrality of Finland, and why the Soviets
                            would agree unless they were persuaded the weapons would shoot in only
                            one direction.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we would give thought and study to the Finnish
                            views, and indicated we were consulting with the British in the matter.
                            He thought the revision of the Treaty was a matter of some substance,
                            not only now, but also for the future. He said he had merely been asking
                            questions and not giving any answers.</p>

                        <p>He placed special emphasis on circumstance that initiative this matter
                            came from Finnish side, pointing out that question had been raised by
                            Finnish President when he visited London in spring of 1961. He contended
                            that degree modernization was unimportant since Finns can afford only
                            minimum number of expensive modern weapons and argued that principal
                            importance would be psychological. He described it as tonic for Finnish
                            armed forces and entire Finnish nation and indicated that Western
                            refusal permit modification would have serious depressing effect on

                            report and that report was essentially in agreement with summary

                            request and asked whether I could indicate any explanation of this
                            circumstance which they found most puzzling.</p>
                        <p>I told them I had no instructions and did not know what ultimate decision
                            on matter might be. After making certain they understood I was merely
                            thinking out loud in effort help them, I expressed opinion that delay
                            might be partly result of bad timing. I reminded them that between
                            initial discussion, when President <persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                >Kekkonen</persName> visited London in spring 1961, and this spring
                            there had occurred the incidents that began with Soviet note of October
                            30 [and] included President’s trip to <pb n="460" xml:id="pg_460"
                                facs="0482"/>Novosibirsk. These incidents had demonstrated to world
                            ability of Russians to shake up Finland and had not in eyes of free
                            world strengthened Finnish position, but rather had made evident degree
                            to which Soviets are able disturb normal Finnish life and developments.
                            Although Soviets had not proceeded carry out what free world and Finns
                            themselves admittedly had recognized as possible military threat to
                            Finnish independence, this threat still hung over Finland. Although
                            Finnish Government had apparently thought it necessary, probably in
                            effort reassure Finnish people after shock of October 30, present
                            Novosibirsk as success, it may be merely stay of execution in light
                            these developments timing renewal their request unfortunate. Foreign
                            Minister himself then remarked perhaps matter might have been more
                            effectively pushed some months earlier or some months later.</p>
                        <p>Without endeavoring counter my opinion that Novosibirsk was not “success”

                                <persName>Jakobson</persName> asserted that events following October
                            30 had made no difference in Finland’s policy or in its determination
                            maintain its neutrality and independence. They invited comment and
                            implied that Soviet note and Novosibirsk should have no influence on any
                            decisions regarding Finnish rearmament. I replied that Soviet
                            demonstration of ability shake Finnish nation was fact of foreign policy
                            even though Finland’s friends might still be convinced of Finnish desire
                            maintain independence and neutrality. They also asked whether I knew of
                            any actions by their government that might indicate change in Finnish
                            policy. I referred to open change in attitude toward forthcoming
                            Communist Youth Festival indicated by statement by Prime Minister
                            Miettunen (Embassy’s telegram 526).<note n="4" xml:id="d223fn4">Telegram

                            matter that had nothing to do with Novosibirsk, but obviously did not
                            find their own argument very convincing.</p>
                        <p>In course remarks regarding timing request treaty reinterpretation,
                            Foreign Minister and Jakobson stated that one reason for pressing matter
                            now was desire at time of budgetary difficulty take advantage available
                            Soviet commercial credits that can also be used for weapons purchase. I
                            remarked that British apparently had understanding that British missiles
                            would also be purchased. They said that this understanding was
                            correct.</p>
                        <p>Despite my frank remarks about October 30–Novosibirsk period,
                            conversation was cordial and sympathetic in tone. Both Finnish officials
                            (Jakobson later privately) reiterated thanks for frank expressions of
                            opinion. They left impression that they themselves feel timing their
                            case <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461" facs="0483"/>is unfortunate and
                            understand difficulties involved in matter, but, that nonetheless they
                            desperately desire decision in Finland’s favor for what they regard as
                            vital political and psychological reasons.</p>

                        <p>The President of Finland, with reference to the conversation between the
                            Secretary of State and the Finnish Ambassador on May 28th,<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d224fn1">See <ref target="#d222">Document 222</ref>.</note>
                            wishes to draw the attention of the Secretary of State to the following: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The Secretary of State, judging by the questions he put to the
                                    Ambassador, appeared to assume that Finland might have accepted
                                    such commitments or obligations as would limit her independence.
                                    This is not the case. No such demands were made by the Soviet
                                    Government either at the meeting at Novosibirsk or on any other
                                    occasion, and no commitments or agreements, secret or public,
                                    have been made on behalf of Finland. The President of the
                                    Republic has no powers to enter into agreements without the
                                    consent of the Government and the Parliament. Thus no change has
                                    taken place in Finland’s ability to pursue her policy of
                                    neutrality or in her relationships with other powers. The
                                    developments since the meeting at Novosibirsk have in fact
                                    confirmed this.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>The initiative taken by the Finnish Government for the purpose
                                    of acquiring defensive guided missiles is not a result of the
                                    Finnish-Soviet exchanges of last fall in which this matter was
                                    not even touched upon. The acquisition of such missiles has been
                                    the aim of Finnish military authorities for several years. It
                                    may also be recalled that the President <pb n="462"
                                        xml:id="pg_462" facs="0484"/>of Finland raised this matter
                                    in his talks with Prime Minister Macmillan in May 1961.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>The Secretary of State asked the Ambassador how it could be
                                    explained that the Soviet Government, at the end of October last
                                    year, considered military consultations with Finland necessary
                                    and yet almost a month later agreed to put them off. No
                                    definitive reply to this question can be given from the Finnish
                                    side. We have no knowledge of how the Soviet Government viewed
                                    the European situation in the light of the Berlin crisis at
                                    different stages in the course of last fall. The note addressed
                                    to Finland on October 30th, 1961, should not, however, be
                                    considered as an isolated event. It was only one of several
                                    Soviet measures, the necessity of which was explained by the
                                    Soviet Government on the grounds of the danger of war created by
                                    the Berlin crisis. Similarly the proposal to initiate military
                                    consultations with Finland was withdrawn at a time when Soviet
                                    policy on the German question appeared to change. The fact that
                                    the Soviet Government at the end of November no longer
                                    considered military consultations with Finland necessary was
                                    thus entirely in line with the development of Soviet policy in
                                    general.</item>

                                <item>Naturally the Soviet note to Finland may have had several
                                    objectives. It has been suggested that one purpose, perhaps the
                                    most important, was to influence the Finnish Presidential
                                    election. There is no doubt that the note and the exchanges
                                    following it could not fail to have an influence on the course
                                    of Finnish politics on the eve of the election. If this was
                                    indeed the purpose of the Soviet Government, the intention could
                                    not, however, have been to bring about a change in Finnish
                                    policy, but rather to prevent any possible change. In any case
                                    the result of the Presidential election confirmed the continuity
                                    of the conduct of Finland’s foreign policy, while the results of
                                    the Parliamentary elections made it possible to form a coalition
                                    government based on the majority secured by the non-socialist
                                    parties in Parliament.</item>

                        <p>Lord <persName corresp="#p_HAFD1">Home</persName> said the Secretary knew
                            the situation in regard to the Finnish request for anti-aircraft
                            missiles instead of obtaining them from Russia. The Scandinavian
                            countries had indicated that they thought that this was very useful and,
                            in addition, there was a military problem if Finland received them from
                            Russia. He very much hoped that the United States would agree with them
                            on this subject.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary inquired whether there was any parliamentary reaction to
                            this request. He said the Finnish Ambassador had recently told him that
                            they would not bring up the matter again with the United States and had
                            implied there was no great hurry in its solution. Lord <persName
                                corresp="#p_HAFD1">Home</persName> said he did not understand since
                            the Finns were telling the British that the delay was intolerable. Mr.
                                <persName>Mason</persName> said that he had had some evidence which
                            indicated a slight slowing-down of Finnish interest. The Secretary said
                            it might merely be a difference in Ambassadors estimates of the national
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then inquired as to whether it is conceivable that these
                            rockets would shoot at anybody other than the West. Lord <persName
                                corresp="#p_HAFD1">Home</persName> admitted that this was the case
                            since if the Russians wished to take action against the Finns, they
                            would not do it in this fashion.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then inquired if the British had discussed this with their
                            bomber command, and Lord <persName corresp="#p_HAFD1">Home</persName>
                            said they had and they agreed <pb n="464" xml:id="pg_464" facs="0486"
                            />that this might give a twenty-minute earlier warning to the Russians
                            in the event of war. Mr. <persName>Mason</persName> explained that there
                            were three cities that the Finns were trying to defend.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary again asked against whom. Mr. <persName>Mason</persName>
                            replied the Finns say against anybody, but did feel that the protection
                            of the cities was better from our point of view than the idea of a belt,
                            which would fit in more with Soviet plans.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then inquired whether the Bloodhound and Thunderbolt
                            missiles could be used for training or whether they were too big. Mr.
                                <persName>Samuel</persName> remarked that he had understood that
                            they were about the same size as <persName>Honest Johns</persName> and
                            doubted if they were small enough for practice or training, but that he
                            would check into this with the technical people.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Mason</persName> then remarked that they did not feel that
                            these rockets contained any classified information under the 1961
                            agreement defining basic concepts, and that as far as they could gather,
                            this was completely on Finnish initiative alone, with Soviet permission
                            particularly to use the ruble credits.</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_CSH1">Harold Caccia</persName> said the
                            political arguments were strongly in favor of supplying missiles from
                            the West, while the military arguments against it were minimal, and that
                            the only problem of Western military defense was that they would be
                            placed on the road to Russia.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said if the Finns were not crowding for an immediate
                            decision, he would like to hold off and he would go back to Washington
                            and check further on this matter with our military and also in regard to
                            the nature of the information. He inquired whether or not commercial
                            considerations entered into the British calculations. Mr.
                                <persName>Mason</persName> said that the commercial effects had not
                            been considered in any British examination of this matter and that in
                            reply to the Finnish Embassy here, it had been said officially that
                            commercial policy was not involved. The only things involved were
                            political and military considerations. The Secretary repeated that our
                            concern was that these missiles could only be fired at us. Mr.
                                <persName>Mason</persName> stated that the Danes, Norwegians, and
                            the Swedes had all approved this idea. Lord <persName corresp="#p_HAFD1"
                                >Home</persName> agreed that they could hold up, but hoped that our
                            response would come quickly.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he understood that the Finns had not yet voted any
                            funds for the purchase of these rockets, and went on to say that the
                            United States was perhaps more skeptical in regard to <persName
                                corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName>’s policy than the British. Lord
                                <persName corresp="#p_HAFD1">Home</persName> said he understood this
                            but felt that since the election there was less ground for suspicion
                            since the elections had gone off quite well.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then inquired what were the number of missiles and what was
                            the total cost. Mr. <persName>Mason</persName> said there were
                            approximately seventy-two <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465" facs="0487"
                            />missiles in groups of seventeen or eighteen. He said he did not know
                            the exact figure but would check.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said another aspect of the matter was that the Finns would
                            pay out quite a lot of money for weapons which would only be useful
                            against aircraft and in a short period of time, with the development of
                            missiles, they would be useless. The Secretary said, however, he would
                            consider it but he did not wish to imply that the result would be
                            automatically favorable. He said we were having a great deal of
                            difficulty with Congress on all matters affecting trade and foreign
                            economics. He said the Executive was trying to maintain flexibility but
                            that only yesterday the Senate, with one dissenting vote—the woman
                            Senator, Mrs. <persName>Neuberg</persName>—had tightened up the
                            financial export measure.<note n="2" xml:id="d225fn2">S. 3161, a bill

                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Problem</hi></p>
                        <p>To prepare a United States response to a British request that the Finnish
                            Peace Treaty be revised or reinterpreted, as requested by the Finnish
                            Government, to permit Finland to acquire guided missile weapons.</p>
                        <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0488"/>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Factors</hi></p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Peace Treaty</hi>. The Treaty ending the state of
                            war with Finland was entered into by Finland with the USSR (and several
                            Iron Curtain countries) and with the United Kingdom (and several
                            Commonwealth countries). The United States is not a signatory to the
                            Treaty. The Treaty places certain restrictions on the Finnish armed
                            forces in terms of manpower and equipment. The Treaty specifically
                            prohibits Finland from acquiring guided missile weapons.</p>
                        <p>Early this year the Finnish Government requested British agreement to a
                            reinterpretation of the Treaty to permit Finland to acquire guided
                            missile weapons. The Finns stated that tacit approval of the USSR was
                            indicated by a Soviet willingness to sell such weapons to Finland.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Finnish Position</hi>. The Finnish Government
                            states that it is endeavoring to strengthen its armed forces in order
                            “to strengthen the basis of Finnish neutrality”. It states that it is a
                            generally accepted view that “a nation aspiring to neutrality must have
                            a convincing capability of effectively protecting by its own efforts the
                            integrity of its territory”. The Finnish Government holds that the
                            restrictions of the Treaty prevent Finland from establishing a modern
                            defense. The Finnish Government asserts that at the time the Treaty was
                            written guided missiles were weapons designed exclusively for aggressive
                            purposes; the military restrictions of the Treaty were designed to
                            prevent Finland from acquiring an aggressive war potential. The Finnish
                            Government asserts that as a result of technical progress guided
                            missiles are now indispensable for defense, and without such weapons
                            Finland cannot make her neutrality convincing.</p>
                        <p>The Finnish armed forces have for long endeavored to acquire more modern
                            and sophisticated weapons. According to the Finnish Foreign Office the
                            acquisition of guided missile weapons is now seen as a method or device
                            to strengthen Finland’s position vis-à-vis the USSR. The Finns state
                            that the possession of such weapons will constitute a deterrent against
                            Soviet demands that Article II of the 1948 Finnish-Soviet Treaty of
                            Friendship and Mutual Assistance be applied. This Article, which formed
                            the basis for the Soviet Note to Finland of last October 30, provides
                            for joint military consultations between the two countries when there
                            exists a military threat to the USSR through Finland from Germany and
                            her allies. This Article is a severe restriction on Finland’s freedom of
                            action. The Finns now feel that the possession of some guided missile
                            batteries will give them “grounds”, or an “excuse”, to resist future
                            Soviet demands that Article II be implemented.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Finnish Procurement Plans</hi>. The Finnish Government
                            has stated publicly that, because of Finland’s neutrality, purchases of
                            military equipment for Finland’s armed forces must be balanced between
                            the East and <pb n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0489"/>West. The Finns
                            have, in the form of an old Ruble credit, about $40 million available
                            for military purchases from the USSR. The Finns have already agreed to
                            purchase aircraft (presumably some MIG 21s), naval engines and guns with
                            part of this sum. In addition they intend to spend some $12.5 million
                            for two to three guided missile batteries of six launchers each.</p>
                        <p>The Finns have told the British that they are prepared to spend in the
                            United Kingdom some $560,000 for the Vigilant, an anti-tank missile.
                            They have also shown an interest in British surface-to-air guided
                            missiles, the Thunderbird I and Bloodhound I. The Finns have made it
                            clear, however, that no budgetary allocations have as yet been made for
                            such British weapons.</p>
                        <p>The Finns have already this year purchased about $3 million worth of
                            modern British radar, and a naval training vessel. They are also
                            purchasing anti-aircraft weapons in Switzerland. These items are not
                            prohibited by the Peace Treaty.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">British Position</hi>. The British Government accepts
                            the Finnish contention that Finland’s position vis-à-vis the USSR will
                            be strengthened by the possession of guided missile weapons. The British
                            feel that the Finnish position is reasonable and realistic. Moreover,
                            the British express much concern over the consequences of a refusal of
                            the Finnish request. They fear that the Finnish armed forces, a strong
                            pro-Western element in Finland, may conclude that the West has no
                            confidence in Finland; morale in the Finnish armed forces would
                            thereupon decline to the detriment of the West. The British admit that
                            Finnish purchase of guided weapons from the USSR would involve technical
                            consultations between the Finns and the Soviets; the British feel,
                            however, that this would be compensated for by the establishment of
                            useful contacts between the Finnish and British military.</p>
                        <p>The British admit that there are some military risks in permitting
                            Finland to have guided weapons. They feel that the overall impact of
                            this would, however, be small; the Finns intend, it is asserted, to ring
                            three or possibly four Finnish cities with guided missile batteries.
                            This would not, in the British view, cause serious problems for the
                            Western bomber forces.</p>
                        <p>Position of Sweden, Norway and Denmark. The Norwegian, Danish and Swedish
                            Governments all favor, according to the British, allowing the Finns to
                            acquire guided missile weapons. Only the Swedes have officially informed
                            the United States of their position in the matter which is that they
                            perceive no objections to acquiescing in the Finnish request for reasons
                            of Swedish national security. Reports from our Embassies at Oslo and
                            Copenhagen tend to confirm the British assertion with respect to Norway
                            and Denmark.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">United States Views</hi>. The Department has
                            consistently taken the position that it would not be in the best
                            interests of the West to agree to a Treaty revision or reinterpretation.
                            The problem is a political-military one requiring careful appraisal of a
                            number of complex political and military factors. The Department’s
                            position has, accordingly, been based on the views expressed in the
                            Department of Defense on the military aspects of the matter, and on a
                            political assessment made within the Department.</p>
                        <p>A military study prepared by the Joint Staff concluded that it would not
                            be in the best interests of the West to permit acquisition by Finland of
                            guided missile weapons; this conclusion was based chiefly on the
                            statement that “there is no way to ensure that these weapons and
                            facilities would not be used against the West”. It was also based on the
                            conclusion that Finnish acquisition of such weapons would be interpreted
                            by Sweden and the Northern <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members
                            as a shift in the balance of power to the USSR. (This has since not
                            proved to be the case.)</p>
                        <p>Subsequently, however, the Department of Defense, in again reviewing the
                            problem, has revised its position. Although that Department does not
                            withdraw its military analysis, as outlined above, it does now believe
                            that the problem is essentially a political one and that the political
                            considerations involved would appear to be overriding in favor of
                            permitting Finland to acquire guided missile weapons.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State has for long been concerned with the external
                            policies followed by President <persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                >Kekkonen</persName>. The course of events during the past 6–8
                            months reveals, in the Department’s view, an excessive Finnish
                            accommodation to the Soviet Union. This has been demonstrated by the
                            weakness of President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName>’s
                            response to the Soviet Note of October 30, the <persName

                            year, and the about-face in the official position of the Finnish
                            Government with respect to the forthcoming Communist World Youth
                            Festival at Helsinki.</p>
                        <p>The Department has held that, given the military risks, the problem
                            hinges on the amount of confidence that can be placed in the Finnish
                            political leadership. The recent course of Finnish-Soviet relations has
                            not given grounds for much confidence.</p>

                            The British wish to sell the surface-to-air missiles Thunderbird I and
                            Bloodhound I to Finland beginning in 1964 or 1965. (The Finns have given
                            no definite undertaking with respect to such purchases.) The United
                            States has held that the sale of these missiles to Finland requires the
                            consent of the United States Government because they contain
                            identifiable classified information of United States origin. The British
                            contest this view, asserting that the relevant <pb n="469"

                            points: (1) Finland is doing its best to maintain its position between
                            East and West; (2) The Finnish Army is well trained and capable of
                            giving a good account of itself; (3) The Finns feel that the time has
                            come to equip their Army with modern equipment; they do not have in mind
                            expensive sophisticated equipment, but are looking for cheap equipment;
                            (4) In buying equipment, it will be necessary to strike a balance
                            between Russian and Western equipment; (5) If the subject arises,
                            Ambassador Nykopp hoped the United States would adopt an understanding
                            attitude.</p>

                        <p>The President has approved a program authorizing the sale to Finland in
                            fiscal 1963 of military equipment at discount prices (involving a cost
                            to the United States of $10 million). The President waived certain legal
                            requirements with respect to this program, and no
                            government-to-government agreement with Finland is contemplated. Insofar
                            as possible, Finnish purchases in the United States would be carried out
                            privately or on the basis of arrangements worked out directly between
                            the Services. No offer of military aid to Finland will be made. The
                            Finns have not as yet been informed of this program, and when they are
                            they will be told simply that they can purchase military equipment in
                            the United States at prices and under terms they will find
                            attractive.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Comment</hi></p>
                        <p>The Finnish Government has recently been more forthcoming in explaining
                            what it considers Finland needs for a modern defense capability. The
                            Finns have linked the problem to Article II of the 1948 Finnish-Soviet
                            Treaty (as explained above). Although President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> has virtually complete control
                            over Finland’s external policies, and has shown an excessive
                            accommodation to the interests of the USSR, there are important
                            restraints on him. Among such restraints are the Finnish armed forces
                            which represent an important pro-Western element in the Finnish society
                            and body politic; by diligent effort on the <pb n="470" xml:id="pg_470"
                                facs="0492"/>part of Finnish military leaders few Communists are
                            within the officer and NCO ranks. The Finnish armed forces can continue
                            to be a pro-Western influence in Finland of considerable importance. It
                            is noteworthy that the Commanding General of the Finnish armed forces
                            has accepted an invitation to visit the United States next autumn.</p>
                        <p>It is evident that the Finns will, under presently known plans, be making
                            their major purchases from the USSR. Finnish intentions with respect to
                            purchases from the United Kingdom are most indefinite and vague.
                            Acquiescence in the Finnish request, without more specific Finnish
                            undertakings with respect to purchases from the West, could tend to
                            facilitate Finnish purchases from the USSR. The result could be a
                            one-sided bargain in which Finland may be drawn more closely into a
                            military relationship with the USSR. In the Department’s view, it is
                            only prudent to seek to prevent such a one-sided bargain.</p>

                            that we again review the matter. The note proposes that both the United
                            States and the United Kingdom sell to Finland at attractive prices arms
                            not prohibited by the Peace Treaty. While continuing to oppose revision
                            of the Treaty, the note indicates that we would review our position if
                            Finland gave undertakings that it would balance purchases of weapons now
                            prohibited by the Treaty between the East and West.</p>

                        <p>588. Department today handed Greenhill, Counselor British Embassy, Note
                            on question revising Finnish Peace Treaty.<note n="1" xml:id="d228fn1">A
                                memorandum of conversation is ibid., 396.1/7–2762. After reading the

                                “halfway along the road.”</note> Following is brief summary of Note.
                            (For Helsinki: text is identical to draft note attached to Position

                        <p>Remains opinion US that revision Finnish Peace Treaty permit Finland
                            acquire guided missiles would result in net military disadvantage for
                            West. Disadvantage not so great however as to make military factor by
                            itself decisive. US also remains of opinion that policies pursued by
                                <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> do not give grounds
                            much confidence that he would be prepared withstand Soviet pressures.
                            Record of events in Finnish-Soviet relations past six to eight months is
                            one of dangerous compromises and accommodations with USSR. There is
                            reason to fear that after Finnish purchase missiles from USSR, Finland
                            may not carry through with purchases from West if Soviets object.
                            Nevertheless US agrees with <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> on
                            importance strengthening pro-Western military leadership in Finland.
                            Clearly in our interest avoid giving Finnish military impression they
                            have been deserted by West and argument can be advanced that
                            strengthening Finnish armed forces will make possible rejection future
                            Soviet demands on Finland for consultation under Article II of 1948
                            Treaty.</p>
                        <p>US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> objectives accordingly should be to
                            strengthen Finnish armed forces with Western weapons while guarding
                            against preponderant Finnish purchases from USSR. US prepared to
                            facilitate Finnish purchases from US sources at attractive prices of
                            weapons not prohibited by Peace Treaty. Similiar action by <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would be helpful. Proceeding this fashion
                            would contribute to strengthening Finnish armed forces without
                            disadvantage involved in revising Treaty.</p>
                        <p>Finnish proposals for revising Treaty (according to Foreign Office memo
                            June 28 to Embassy London) accord disproportionate opportunities to
                            Soviet Bloc. Arrangements are at hand for acquiring missiles from USSR
                            while purchases from <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> dependent on
                            future appropriations Finnish Parliament. Specifically US Government
                            wishes to know what <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473" facs="0495"
                            />undertakings <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> has in mind obtaining
                            from Finland to assure, if Treaty revised, that purchases will in fact
                            be roughly balanced between East and West. Unless there are such
                            undertakings from Finnish political as well as military authorities
                            revision of Treaty likely to facilitate purchases from Soviet Bloc.</p>
                        <p>US Government continues believe its consent required prior to release
                            Bloodhound and Thunderbird missiles to Finland. US prepared however to
                            hold joint consultation at technical level with a view to resolve
                            misunderstandings and differences of opinion.</p>
                        <p>End summary, full text being pouched.</p>
                        <p>Department informed Greenhill we would appreciate early reaction to Note
                            since we were getting number of indications that Finns interested in
                            acquiring weapons from US. Greenhill reiterated urgency involved in
                            settling problems connected with Thunderbird and Bloodhound missiles.
                            Department suggested S–DMICC (State–Defense Military Information Control
                            Committee) might meet with its British counterpart to resolve

                            President’s idea and taken on his initiative after consultation with

                            abroad regarding reaction in interested free world countries to

                            this reaction appears have become entangled with question modernization
                            Finnish armed forces. He therefore apparently considers it imprudent
                            pursue matter at least for time being. His outstanding motivations for
                            dropping it now are: (1) wish demonstrate that Finland made request
                            freely and is free to withdraw it, and (2) belief it advisable, in view
                            long delay in bringing matter to satisfactory conclusion, withdraw
                            request in order remove any grounds Russians might feel application
                            gives them press Finland for an answer or for action one way or another

                            unreasonably mistrusted in West and that “good results his American
                            visit seem to have run dry”. He is inclined reproach Finnish military

                            missiles and blame them for having pushed matter too fast. From remarks

                        <p>105. Called yesterday afternoon on President <persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                >Kekkonen</persName> accompanied by Friberg as interpreter to
                            present him with album of his visit to United States. Also presented
                            framed colored picture sent to US earlier for delivery to him. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> appeared genuinely pleased,
                            expressed his gratitude and said he would write personal letter to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>.</p>
                        <p>After usual amenities about summer activities, I asked President what he
                            thought of present world situation. “It doesn’t look too good”, he
                            replied, “and Berlin is particularly bad.” He then mentioned his plans
                            visit Soviet Union with nothing in mind of a political nature “for
                            vacation” in October, prior to his visit to France. He remarked that
                            right after <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had
                            extended French invitation, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> had written him letter dated April 4,
                            renewing earlier oral invitation. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khru-shchev</persName>’s letter was couched in such terms that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> assumes he will have
                            chance meet and talk with him. This he believes will be particularly
                            interesting since he will be able pass to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
                                Gaulle</persName> his impressions of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s current attitudes.</p>
                        <p>Returning to German question, I remarked that “Berlin crisis” had been
                            created solely by Soviet Union which could turn it on and off at will
                            and that it was therefore not genuine crisis. I strongly expressed hope
                            that Finland would not change its policy toward Germany or in any way
                            modify its present relationship toward Germany by signing peace treaty
                            with Pankow regime or changing status Finnish relationship with it. I
                            added that present relationship is consistent with Finnish neutrality.
                            President said that he had heard rumors of Soviet pressure on Finland to
                            recognize East Germany. They were simply not true, he affirmed. He
                            added, “We have done fairly well so far and I hope it will continue. I
                            don’t have any reason to doubt that we won’t come out all right.”</p>
                        <p>I next took up with President matter Finnish participation in San Juan
                            conference (Embassy telegram 93)<note n="1" xml:id="d232fn1">Telegram
                                93, August 21, reported that a Finnish decision to attend the San
                                Juan conference had to await the return of a number of senior
                                officials to Helsinki. (Ibid., 398.06–SA/8–2162)</note> on middle
                            level manpower. I told him that attendance by Minister Pohjala or some
                            other Cabinet member concerned with such matters would be welcomed. I
                            explained that I had discussed the matter with Foreign Office and had
                            provided <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478" facs="0500"/>papers pertinent to
                            conference. The President replied that Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_MV1">Merikoski</persName> had spoken to him about
                            conference although he had seen no papers. President promised study
                            matter and talk to his Ministers about it.</p>
                        <p>President raised topic of Finnish trade and said that besides German
                            situation, Finland faces serious difficulties in years ahead on matters
                            of trade but he had noticed that solutions arrived at by Finns had
                            received the support of West. He hoped that support and understanding
                            would continue. I asked whether he was concerned about enlargement of
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. He said no, Finland was
                            “following the situation from afar”; Finland will wait see how England,
                            Switzerland, Austria and Sweden make out first. He said that
                            representatives from “West” had given him to understand that “our action
                            is only right one” and that policy of wait-and-see is, under the
                            circumstances, wisest. This, he added, is also attitude of
                            industrialists in Finland. He went on say that Finnish industrial
                            expansion was going on rapidly and would continue to increase until
                            1965. For this reason it is all the more important that Finland assure
                            itself of markets in West. Finland can arrange to build factories itself
                            but needs support of West to insure continuing high level of trade to
                            keep factories operating. He said this with obvious intent underscore
                            that what Finland needs is trade, not just help in building industrial
                            capacity.</p>
                        <p>When we were discussing summer activities, I mentioned among other trips
                            taken in Finland three day visit to <persName corresp="#p_SR1"
                                >Seppalas</persName> Island. President said that he had been ill
                            this summer again with his old trouble, otherwise he had expected visit
                                <persName corresp="#p_SR1">Seppalas</persName> same week-end. He
                            felt illness was his gall bladder although the doctors have not been
                            able to make definite diagnosis. He has been operated on twice but
                            operations do not seem to have helped. He said he was just getting over
                            the effects of his illness. I have heard from another well informed
                            source outside government that he suffers from diabetes and for that
                            reason always travels with physician in attendance. This source said
                            that <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> always suffers
                            health troubles when subjected to strain or worry. Yesterday afternoon
                            he appeared be in fairly good health although he showed his age more
                            than when I last saw him.</p>
                        <p>On taking leave, I thanked President for receiving me and told him I
                            should like to see him again before long and would especially like see
                            him after his visits to Soviet Union and France. He replied that he
                            would be glad to see me then and added that if at any time I had
                            anything on my mind I could call him. He said that he had hoped to have
                            me at his summer place in Naantali but weather had been so bad that he
                            was afraid to have anyone there this summer. “Next summer will have to
                            be better”, he added jokingly.</p>
                        <pb n="479" xml:id="pg_479" facs="0501"/>
                        <p>Throughout our entire conversation he was most friendly and relaxed and
                            did not even hint at any controversial matters.</p>

                            called on President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> at 4
                            this afternoon and informed him as instructed that we are prepared
                            arrange for Finland purchase US military equipment on favorable terms. I
                            stressed that this was not gift or loan but offer arrange purchase terms
                            and prices which would suit Finland’s special circumstances, taking into
                            account need not embarrass or disturb Finland’s neutrality. I said I had
                            no specific or detailed proposal present at this stage but was seeking
                            President’s comments and advice. I added, that (A) no military aid
                            program for Finland was envisaged, (B) that no offer of military aid
                            would be made and (C) that no political commitments were involved.</p>
                        <p>President expressed his appreciation for offer. He said that there are
                            large gaps between plans for procurement military equipment and ability
                            Finnish Government realize them and he therefore is grateful for our
                            proposal. Finland is prepared buy weapons from different parts of world
                            in line with its policy of neutrality. He made special point of
                            stressing that in principle Finland has nothing against purchasing
                            military equipment from US.</p>
                        <p>He said that purchases from Soviet Union were made only because of
                            availability of ruble funds. He took pains explain that ruble loan made
                            to Finland in 1958 was originally intended for industrial and railway
                            equipment. When, however, it was not possible find in Soviet Union
                            equipment that would meet Finnish needs, large surplus remained which
                            Finnish defense forces proposed be used for arms purchases. That is the
                            history, he concluded, and “under no circumstances would I have sought
                            loan from Soviet Union for purchase of arms.”</p>
                        <p>In regard to manner of proceeding he said that he would take matter up
                            with Finnish Cabinet at earliest possible time. He explained that as
                            first step and before military take over matter, it would be wisest for

                            Government. After that, he himself or some member of the Cabinet will
                            get in touch with me.</p>
                        <p>He told me that General Simelius would be informed of content of our talk
                            and that matter could be taken up with Simelius in Washington. He
                            suggested that Simelius might be shown equipment which we are <pb
                                n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0505"/>willing sell and perhaps also
                            equipment that Simelius himself asks about.</p>
                        <p>I asked President whether we might expect some answer from him before
                            Simelius goes to US. He replied that time is so short that it may be
                            difficult and that perhaps it might be better continue our discussion
                            after Simelius returns from his visit to US.</p>
                        <p>Just before our departure, President said that Finnish Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_MV1">Merikoski</persName>, who is now in US at

                            “routine and current.” He also said that <persName corresp="#p_MV1"
                                >Merikoski</persName> had gone to Paris to see his French
                            counterpart to explain the Finnish situation prior to President
                            Kekkonen’s visit there in October.</p>
                        <p>President did not say whether he would inform <persName corresp="#p_MV1"
                                >Merikoski</persName> of our offer. We assume that he may, although
                            his use of words “routine and current” may have been intended to imply

                        <p>Having touched on Finland’s policy of neutrality and President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName>’s visit last year to the <gloss
                                target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>, the Foreign Minister said he wished to
                            turn to a more important question which had been the subject of previous
                            discussions. This question was the Finnish plan to acquire defensive air
                            missiles. However, last spring the Finns found their plan to buy
                            anti-aircraft missiles from the USSR using their ruble credit there had
                            raised some doubts in the US. As it became clear to the Finns that
                            linking the question of the reinterpretation of the Peace Treaty to
                            these particular purchases had become a liability to Finland in their
                            foreign relations, the Finnish Government had decided not to go ahead on
                            these purchases. By this decision the Finns wanted to demonstrate that
                            they were not acting under compulsion from any quarter in this
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister continued that the acquisition of anti-aircraft
                            missiles was not so important for purely military reasons. The Finns
                            realize their military potential is not great. From the point of view of
                            creating internal confidence in the Finnish potential to defend
                            themselves, the acquisition of missiles is of considerable value.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister expressed satisfaction that the Finnish point of
                            view has now been understood by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            and the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>. He wished to extend to the
                            Secretary his personal appreciation that this matter has been brought to
                            a conclusion. It would now be possible for the Finns to <pb n="485"
                                xml:id="pg_485" facs="0507"/>modernize their defense forces in this
                            important respect. The British Government’s decision to accept Finnish
                            reinterpretation of the Peace Treaty and the willingness of the US to
                            sell conventional armaments were regarded by the Finnish Govt. as
                            expressions of confidence in its policy of neutrality. The sole purpose
                            of Finnish efforts to modernize and strengthen their defense capacity is
                            to strengthen their security and neutrality.</p>
                        <p>As to what amount of armaments including ground-to-air missiles the Finns
                            were prepared to purchase, the Foreign Minister stated this would be
                            considered by the Finnish Cabinet after the return of President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> from his visit to the
                            Soviet Union. He could only say at this time that the Finns are taking
                            into account in deciding on what purchases to make the possible effect
                            on Finnish neutrality. He emphasized that at the moment the Finns had no
                            plans for the purchase of ground-to-air missiles. The British had made
                            certain proposals in the past including the offer of Vigilant anti-tank
                            missiles. These British offers will be considered at the same time the
                            Cabinet meets. He reiterated that though in the past the Finns had
                            planned to buy specific missiles from the USSR, at the moment there were
                            no definite plans.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the subject of aircraft purchases, the Foreign Minister
                            pointed out that Finland had up to the present time purchased military
                            aircraft from France, Sweden and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.
                            The Finns were now negotiating for the purchase of a small number of
                            Soviet aircraft—one squadron of MIG fighters. This type of fighter plane
                            can carry air-to-air missiles but until now the Finns have not
                            negotiated with the Soviets for the purchase of such missiles. This
                            squadron would contain only 15 combat planes though in addition some
                            training planes would be involved.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said he had wanted to inform the Secretary in
                            general terms of the Finnish position at this stage on the acquisition
                            of defensive armaments. The Finns regarded it as most important to
                            clarify their position on purchases of armaments. He also wished to
                            refer to the information recently received from Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_GB1">Gufler</persName> by President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> that the US is willing to sell
                            conventional armaments to Finland. As the President told Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_GB1">Gufler</persName>, the Finns have
                            received this news with the greatest satisfaction. What the Finns may be
                            able to buy from the US will have to be considered carefully when the
                            Cabinet reviews the over-all problem of armament purchases.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister then referred to the disastrous year which Finland
                            had experienced for its agricultural production and remarked on the
                            great drain on the Finnish budget. However, he thought that some
                            arrangements could be made for purchasing certain armaments in the
                            US.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he wished to emphasize that the primary responsibility
                            in regard to the reinterpretation of the Finnish Peace Treaty <pb
                                n="486" xml:id="pg_486" facs="0508"/>rested upon the parties to that
                            Treaty. It was not for the US to reinterpret the Treaty in place of the
                            signatories to the Treaty. However personally the Secretary said he was
                            a little puzzled by the underlying military rationale for the purchase
                            of missiles now being considered by Finland. Missiles were a very
                            expensive business. They require elaborate equipment, complicated radar,
                            high technical skill and training and expensive construction work. For
                            instance, the Secretary cited the limited number of ground-to-air
                            missiles supplied to Cuba by the USSR which we estimate to cost in the
                            neighborhood of $60 million.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently the Secretary said he would like to make some further
                            observations. He thought careful consideration should be given to the
                            circumstances of Finland’s military position in regard to its
                            geographical location and its relation to the continent of Europe.
                            Besides the factor of expense of installing these air defense missiles
                            and the training of personnel, the problem of war in Europe should be
                            seen in terms of a rocket war. Here the Secretary remarked that while we
                            of course hoped there would be no war, if his conversation with the
                            Foreign Minister was to have any reality on the issue of armaments
                            purchases, it must be spoken about in terms of the possibility of war.
                            In the age of rockets manned aircraft were beginning to be obsolete and
                            the Finns might not find any to shoot at with ground-to-air missiles. In
                            his opinion the primary defense of Finland was not to become a target
                            for either side in the event of war. The warring powers would probably
                            be so heavily involved with themselves that these countries which had no
                            targets would be left alone because there would be nothing worth
                            shooting at.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he did not wish to comment further on the expense of
                            acquiring missiles from the Soviet Union since he was not certain the
                            value the Finns put on their ruble credit. But if the Finns plan to
                            spend their own resources for the purchase of missiles, he would counsel
                            them to consider this matter very carefully. Missiles which other
                            countries were willing to supply were in all probability already
                            obsolete—first generation missiles—or otherwise these countries would
                            not be willing to sell them to Finland.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary reiterated that his comments did not cancel his earlier
                            remark that the question of the reinterpretation of the Peace Treaty was
                            basically an issue for the signatories to the Treaty. However, he
                            thought as a friend to Finland he ought to express his personal
                            puzzlement at the Finnish desire to acquire missiles given Finland’s
                            limited resources.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MV1">Merikoski</persName>
                            expressed surprise that the Secretary could look so deeply into one of
                            so many countries in the world. He said their ruble credit in the USSR
                            was a commercial credit and therefore it did have value. It was not a
                            gift from the Soviet Union. As he had already remarked, the Finns
                            realize their planned purchase of ground-to-air missiles was not of
                            great value from the military viewpoint. The <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487"
                                facs="0509"/>Finnish idea was to have some kind of air defense which
                            their population supports. Even at that he realized this would not be a
                            completely effective defense. Their main purpose was to strengthen the
                            belief and confidence of the Finnish people in their government’s
                            efforts to be able to defend themselves. This project would not run into
                            anything like the cost mentioned by the Secretary in regard to Cuba.
                            They had previously planned to purchase from the USSR only three
                            batteries costing in the neighborhood of $12 million. They had already
                            made a contract in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> for the
                            necessary radar amounting to approximately four million pounds. The
                            Secretary observed that his remarks had related only to ground-to-air
                            missiles and not to anti-tank missiles or other armaments. He added that
                            if we were sending an official note to Finland, we would not be saying
                            the things said today.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister commented the Secretary had mentioned the training
                            of personnel for these complex ground-to-air missiles. He wished to note
                            that the question of training of crews had not yet come up with the
                            USSR. The portion of ruble credit allocated for purchases from the USSR
                            of defensive weapons by the Finnish military had already been used up so
                            if there were to be new purchases it would require a new decision by the
                            Finnish Government.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that training ground crews for missiles requires
                            about twelve to eighteen months. If the purchase of air-to-ground
                            missiles meant that crews would be furnished by the supplying country in
                            the intervening time, this could create embarrassment for Finnish
                            neutrality. For instance in Cuba if their defensive air missiles were to
                            be used in the next year, we would have to assume that they would be
                            serviced by Soviet crews. This question of trained crews could present
                            difficult political problems.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister asserted that the only current training project
                            concerned the training in the Soviet Union of Finnish air officers for
                            aircraft purchased in the USSR. There would be no Soviet instructors in
                            Finland.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that he was glad he was not a member of the
                            Finnish Cabinet and had to participate in decisions on the question of
                            purchasing missiles. This question involved the position of Finland in
                            relation to the total military picture in Europe. If the Finns had a
                            different geographical position, the problems might be different.
                            Referring to the expense of sophisticated weapons, the Secretary
                            observed somewhat laughingly that some officers in the Pentagon have a
                            saying in regard to weapons that “if it shoots, it’s obsolete”.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SR1">Seppala</persName> stated that the
                            Finns have an army which needs to be modernized. They could not be armed
                            just with old rifles. Here the psychological element was very important.
                            Small countries can’t defend themselves but they need to have the
                            potential to make a “bang”. <pb n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0510"/>The
                            Secretary concluded by referring to an African friend who recently had
                            asked for the US to supply his country with supersonic aircraft. He had
                            pointed out to this African friend that the cost of these aircraft would
                            be enough to establish and run two universities. Again the Secretary
                            emphasized that this issue was basically a matter for the signatories to
                            the Peace Treaty.</p>

                            British decision in favor of reinterpretation of the Finnish Peace
                            Treaty, to the Secretary’s recent conversation with Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_MV1">Merikoski</persName>, and to the
                            information conveyed to President <persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                >Kekkonen</persName> by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GB1"
                                >Gufler</persName> that the United States would be willing to sell
                            military materiel to Finland. Regarding the latter subject, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_SR1">Seppala</persName> said that General
                            Simelius, Chief of the Finnish Defense Forces, had brought with him on
                            his current trip to the United States a list of military items in which
                            the Finns were interested, and that the list had been presented to
                            General Wheeler, Chief of Staff of the US Army, who was his host. The
                            list was also discussed by General Simelius with General Maxwell Taylor,
                            who had indicated that General Wheeler would be the point of contact in
                            discussions regarding the list. The Ambassador said that he had not been
                            aware of the list beforehand, but that no harm had been done.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SR1">Seppala</persName> then said that
                            he wished to inform the Department of State of the list and to give us
                            exactly the same list. He said that he desired to stress that it was
                            only a tentative list, and that he did not know how orthodox it was, but
                            that it gave some indication of the items in which the Finnish armed
                            forces were interested.</p>
                        <p>What they would actually purchase, he said, depended on the rather
                            limited Finnish budgetary resources and the decisions yet to be made by
                            the Cabinet or the Defense Council. He recalled that Generals Taylor and
                            Wheeler had observed that on some items there would be no difficulty but
                            that others would have to be studied by the Departments of State and
                            Defense.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWC1">Burdett</persName> expressed appreciation
                            to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SR1">Seppala</persName> for making
                            the list available. He said that we had anticipated that General
                            Simelius would be informed of this question, and asked how the matter
                            had been left in the Pentagon in terms of the next step. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_SR1">Seppala</persName>
                            <pb n="490" xml:id="pg_490" facs="0512"/>said that as he understood it
                            there was not enough time while General Simelius was in Washington for a
                            thorough study of the list to be made, but that when such a study had
                            been completed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SR1">Seppala</persName>
                            or his Military attache would be informed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWC1">Burdett</persName> referred to the

                            question and noted that the Secretary had made certain comments on this

                                corresp="#p_BWC1">Burdett</persName> said that we have nothing to
                            add on that subject and that the US offer of military equipment had been
                            in our minds for some time and was not related to the other problem.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SR1">Seppala</persName> reiterated that
                            he hoped the list would be handled on a very confidential basis.</p>
                        <p>A brief discussion of various aspects of the present Cuban situation then
                            followed, with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWC1">Burdett</persName>
                            providing current information regarding the quarantine and the other
                            regulations regarding shipping to Cuba. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SR1">Seppala</persName> commented that the Finns were
                            especially interested in the impact of developments on the Berlin
                            situation.</p>

                            He has given matter great deal of thought and now believes that, because
                            of Cuban situation, he will have postpone taking advantage of offer.
                            Whenever it is considered, he fears leak will inevitably occur and, if
                            it is considered now, Soviets might interpret US proposal as effort to
                            follow up American success in Cuba by pushing into area close to Soviet
                            Union. Soviets, he explained, are so suspicious that they react to much
                            smaller moves and he is afraid Finland cannot afford take chance right
                            now.</p>
                        <p>I asked President whether postponement meant that he was still interested
                            in offer. He replied, “yes, but at time that would present more
                            favorable opportunity.” He added that he wanted underscore that his
                            actions were not prompted by anything said by Soviets to him or any
                            other Finnish officials but that his decision was based on his personal
                            weighing of risks and familiarity with Soviets.</p>
                        <p>President made some general comments about economic situation in Finland,
                            saying it had slowed down but that developments were not too bad.
                            Majority Cabinet had brought political peace in nation except for one
                            question which was presently timely, matter of forest workers pay, which
                            could cause government fall although he believed and hoped difficulties
                            could be ironed out as it would be shame have government fall over such
                            minor issue.</p>
                        <p>President said had found good deal of sympathy in France particularly on
                            question of trade. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had
                            asked him how development of <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> had
                            affected Finnish trade. He answered it had not affected Finnish trade as
                            yet because Finland’s biggest competitors, Sweden and Austria, have been
                            in same situation as Finland. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De

                                (Department of State, Central Files, 611.60E/10–1762)</note> He went
                            on say, however, that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            had told him that he did not foresee trouble over Cuba. As to Berlin,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had repeated his
                            earlier harshly-worded stand for separate peace on Soviet conditions but
                            had set no time limit. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            had said Soviets were not “prisoners of time.”</p>
                        <p>President said he had difficult task re Finno-Soviet trade. He had tried
                            without success persuade <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> agree handle payment negotiations separately
                            from trade negotiations. Later on when trade negotiations <pb n="492"
                                xml:id="pg_492" facs="0514"/>were held in Finland, Soviets did give
                            in. President explained that it would have been bad for employment in
                            woodworking industry, which is already working at only 75 percent
                            capacity, if some agreement could not have been reached on continued
                            export Finnish forest products to Soviet Union. Soviets have now agreed
                            maintain their imports up to five-year trade agreement level. Finns
                            pressed for more payment in convertible currency in trade with Soviet
                            Union but so far without success. Finns now getting about 9 million
                            rubles in convertible currency but have asked Soviets raise this to 18
                            million to cover amounts Finns are obliged pay for electrical machinery
                            and other equipment procured outside Finland for installation in
                            icebreakers and other completed products exported to Soviet Union under
                            trade agreement.</p>
                        <p>President said <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had made
                            no reference to differences between China and Soviet Union. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName>’s personal impression is that
                            matters developing badly. He said that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s strong words on China were big surprise to
                            him as, despite fact that differences existed, he did not expect them be
                            brought out so openly. He added it obvious that big changes taking place
                            in Chinese politics. He remarked that Soviets have problem of resisting
                            pressure from China while trying maintain their position in West.</p>
                        <p>He offered opinion that despite Cuba and China’s reaction, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khru-shchev</persName>’s position had only become
                            stronger, speculations in Western press notwithstanding. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s health was good, he
                            added.</p>
                        <p>In course discussion, President referred to Kissinger “Nuclear Power and
                            Foreign Policy”.<note n="5" xml:id="d239fn5">Reference is to Kissinger’s
                                book published by the Council of Foreign Relations in 1957.</note>
                            He thought Kissinger’s ideas formed basis for much of U.S. strategy and
                            preparedness and termed book very enlightening. He foresees difficulties
                            in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries accepting basis of
                            this strategy, however. <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName>’s

                            September attacking U.S. handling of Cuba, about which Secretary

                                corresp="#p_MV1">Merikoski</persName> (Embassy’s A–330).<note n="6"

                                Files, 760E.12/10–2262)</note> I explained that Finnish press is
                            closely read in Department of State and that <hi rend="italic"
                                >Maakansa</hi> known as organ close to government as is Paasikivi
                            Society’s publication <hi rend="italic">Ulkopolitikka</hi> (<hi
                                rend="italic">Foreign Policy</hi>). I added that article in Maakansa
                            to my knowledge occasioned first protest ever made by us about Finnish
                            newspaper item. President’s reaction was very conciliatory. He explained
                            article had appeared while he was away and while chief editor Sorvali
                            was away. As soon as Sorvali returned and learned what had happened, he
                            called <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> to express his
                            regrets and promised convey those regrets to someone he knew in American
                            Embassy. President <pb n="493" xml:id="pg_493" facs="0515"/>said, “and I
                            hope he has done this”. (<hi rend="italic">Note:</hi> Up to today no
                            expression of regret by Sorvali has been passed on to me.) President
                            deplored incident, said that damaging accidents happen of which this was
                            one and gave assurances it would not happen again.</p>
                        <p>As to publication <hi rend="italic">Ulkopolitikka</hi>, President said he
                            did not consider its articles too dangerous. It contained anti-German
                            articles and other critical opinions similar to those expressed by some
                            organs of British Labor Party but there was nothing really serious in
                            them. Article in <hi rend="italic">Maakansa</hi> was in another
                            category, however, which he regrets. Perhaps, he added, this will be
                            good lesson for chief editor, but it unfortunate that accident happened
                            at such bad time.</p>
                        <p>In closing conversation President asked me convey his personal regards to

                            U.S.-Finnish relations. President <persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                >Kekkonen</persName>’s belief that he can best handle Finnish-Soviet
                            relations alone without the support of the Western countries, and his
                            judgment that Finnish independence and security are dependent on a clear
                            policy of friendship for the USSR serve to emphasize the need for
                            delicacy in U.S.-Finnish official exchanges.</p>
                        <p>Such attributes of Finnish national character as integrity and tenacious
                            courage, when united in common endeavor, give the country its <pb
                                n="494" xml:id="pg_494" facs="0516"/>greatest strength. Our policies
                            should seek to direct these genuine Finnish impulses to the purpose of
                            defending Finnish independence and resisting Soviet pressures. We should
                            endeavor to change the chronic Finnish bias to define and interpret
                            Finnish national policies in terms of anticipated reactions of the USSR.
                            To do this we must convince the Finns that the destiny of their country
                            lies with a confident and strong Western community of nations. This
                            involves strengthening and increasing the economic, political and
                            cultural ties which link Finland with the free world. It means that we
                            should encourage greater cooperation between non-Communist Finnish
                            political parties in order to strengthen Finland from within.</p>
                        <p>As Finland’s self-confidence and internal strength grow, and as the Finns
                            show greater determination to stand firm against pressures from the
                            USSR, we should be prepared to give more direct support to the country.
                            For the foreseeable future, however, we should take care to avoid
                            commitments which cannot be sustained, and—insofar as possible—a direct
                            confrontation with the USSR in Finland.</p>

                                    he had to make it clear that Finland unwilling ever to be
                                    repository nuclear weapons for any power. Clear implication was
                                    that <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> foresees
                                    possibility that, as reaction to <gloss target="#t_MLF1"
                                        >MLF</gloss>, or new Berlin crisis, Soviets might demand
                                    Finland permit stationing Soviet nuclear weapons Finnish soil,
                                    thus provoking political crisis similar to and perhaps worse
                                    than that of 1961. <persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                        >Kekkonen</persName> feels that speech gives Russians
                                    “advance notice.”</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Whether speech represents nationalistic shrewdness on <persName
                                corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName>’s part, or whether he softening
                            Scandinavia for what we perceive to be “Soviet charm offensive,” I do
                            not pretend know. But believe it wise at this juncture for us to accept
                            Jakobson explanation at face value, barring evidence contrary.</p>
                        <p>Jakobson spoke at length about fact Finland “takes Western friendship for
                            granted” and “perhaps speaks too much about need for Soviet friendship.”
                            He and <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> obviously aware of
                            growing criticism and uneasiness in West. My view that we should show no
                            nervousness, no excess distrust, for period, while giving government
                            chance to explain and show effectiveness its tacks.</p>

                                >Dean</persName></hi>: As you will know, the Prime Minister is
                            making a brief visit to Finland from August 6 to 9. I have been warned
                            by our Ambassador at Helsinki that the Finns may well ask how soon we
                            can supply them with a small quantity—perhaps a dozen—surface-to-air
                            missiles for training purposes. So far as availability in the United
                            Kingdom is concerned, we should be able to supply the Finns with as many
                            second-hand Bloodhound I missiles as they are likely to want some time
                            towards the middle of next year.</p>
                        <p>You will remember that we talked about the supply of guided weapons to
                            Finland in New York on September 27 last year<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d242fn1">Their discussion took place during <persName

                                informed <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> that the Finns
                                had again raised the issue of missile sales. The British would
                                insist on a detailed statement of Finnish plans, but planned to go
                                forward with the sale once the information was analyzed. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> restated U.S. concerns, but
                                agreed to a reevaluation of the U.S. position after Finland had made
                                its detailed presentation. (Telegram 549 to Helsinki, September 28,

                            concerned you was the danger that the Finns might get large quantities
                            of these weapons and deploy them as a barrage across Finland. I
                            undertook to see what could <pb n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0521"/>be
                            done to avoid this danger and said that if we could get satisfactory
                            assurances from the Finns we should wish to go ahead and sell them some
                            weapons. I understood that you might be prepared to see the matter go
                            through on this basis.</p>
                        <p>I would not have raised this business with you again in the ordinary way.
                            But I am told that at the technical security talks which were held in
                            Washington in December last and April this year your people maintained
                            that United States agreement was required before the release to third
                            countries of components or weapons of British manufacture but deriving
                            from United States basic concepts even when these concepts had
                            subsequently been published. The Bloodhound I would be affected by this
                            since its fuze derives from United States basic information which has in
                            the meantime been published.</p>
                        <p>I should say at once that our people disagree with the interpretation of
                            the relevant agreements which your people maintained last December. It
                            was for this reason that we held, throughout our discussions with you
                            last year over the question of Finnish acquisition of guided weapons,
                            that the technical security angle was no obstacle so far as we could
                            see. Nevertheless, we naturally do not want to ignore the position which
                            your people have adopted in deciding what we should say to the Finns
                            when they ask us when we can supply them with guided weapons.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, it would, I think, make nonsense of the conditions
                            which, with your views in mind, we attached to our agreement to the
                            Finnish Treaty re-interpretation, if we were now to have to tell the
                            Finns that we could not supply the weapons. Since we asked them to
                            undertake to get at least as many guided weapons from the West as from
                            the East, we would, in effect, be nullifying our agreement in what they
                            would be bound to regard as a very dubious manner.</p>
                        <p>I am advised, moreover, that the security angle is not really relevant.
                            In the first place, a recent appreciation which we have sent to your
                            people shows that the Russians are already equipped to take
                            counter-measures on the frequencies which you use in fuzes similar to
                            the Bloodhound I fuze. Secondly, as I imagine you will have heard, we
                            have now learnt to our dismay that Colonel
                                <persName>Wennerstrom</persName><note n="3" xml:id="d242fn3">Colonel

                            to the Russians. So even if the Russians had to rely on knowledge of our
                            fuze to work out counter-measures against yours, we should now have to
                            assume that they had obtained this knowledge.</p>
                        <p>If the Finns do ask us what we can do about guided weapons during our
                            visit there early next month, I should very much like to be able to tell

                            will agree that this is important and I trust that you will be prepared

                        <p>100. Pass to DIA. Max Jakobson, Chief of Foreign Office political
                            section, has denied categorically that Finland is about to buy Russian
                            missiles of any type. During discussion after dinner at residence, he
                            disclosed that Finland has given British written guarantee that at least
                            half surface-to-air missiles will be bought from them.</p>
                        <p>“It is inconceivable that we would break that agreement,” he assured me,
                            adding that <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> will not wish negotiate

                        <p>I raised subject by saying I had heard rumors Finland was eager discuss
                            Bloodhound I with Macmillan and wondered if anything decided in wake of
                            his visit. Jakobson replied that <persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                >Kekkonen</persName> had told Macmillan Finland interested, but
                            short of money, so question in abeyance.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out that money question different with regard Russia and asked
                            state missile negotiations with Soviets.</p>
                        <p>Jakobson stated categorically that no such negotiations underway.</p>
                        <p>I replied I pleased to hear this in view of recurring rumors that
                            missiles deal with Soviets imminent. Said I knew <gloss target="#t_GOF1"
                                >GOF</gloss> aware that one-sided deal would leave some people
                            feeling they had been duped in agreeing to reinterpretation peace

                        <p>It then that Jakobson mentioned written guarantees and said I would
                            “wager your life” on fact Finland not cooking up separate missile deal
                            with Soviets.</p>
                        <p>(While Embassy knew of pledge to British, this first word we had had of
                            “written guarantees”. Will check this with British colleague in

                        <p>163. CODEL <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>. Vice President

                                >Kekkonen</persName>, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KA1"

                        <p>Finland’s relations with the Soviets and the West—after brief discussion
                            of Vice President’s program during preceding hours, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> stressed his appreciation for
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>’s understanding
                            of Finland’s foreign policy, expressed during <persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                >Kekkonen</persName>’s visit <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0524"
                            />to Washington. He took Vice President’s visit as proof of that
                            understanding. <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> pointed
                            out that even though Finnish Government crisis in progress, it did not
                            inhibit foreign or economic policy discussions since in these fields
                            changes of government had no effect.</p>
                        <p>Vice President stated that <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                            administration’s most stressing objective was search for world peace and
                            that this was basis of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                                >Kennedy</persName>’s comprehension of Finland’s neutrality policy.
                            However, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> was
                            equally anxious that Finland remain strong in order to defend itself.
                            Vice President stressed US belief that only the strong can be free and
                            independent. <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> agreed with
                            statement but explained that Finland felt question of global war or
                            peace was beyond its competence. Therefore Finland concentrated on
                            building economic strength; it must continue to increase living
                            standards in order that Soviets not overtake it and win Finnish workers
                            to Communist ideology. Unemployment was therefore Finland’s gravest
                            danger—particularly among industrial workers, among whom 10,000
                            unemployed more dangerous than 100,000 foresters or farmers without
                            work.</p>
                        <p>Vice President reaffirmed President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                                >Kennedy</persName>’s explicit recognition of Finland’s right to
                            follow policy of avoiding entangling alliances. He stated that US wanted
                            every country to be as free to choose its policy as in US. Although
                            present post-test ban treaty atmosphere was encouraging, progress
                            depended on continued maintenance of our strength. Vice President
                            promised US would remain strong and cautious in pursuit of peace. In
                            return he asked that Finland continue its efforts to avoid entanglements
                            with either side during any period of more relaxed East-West
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> responded that
                            Finland would continue this policy regardless of whether tension in
                            East-West relations lessened. Finland would maintain its independence in
                            either event. In fact Finland’s determination was so solid that Finns
                            were surprised when foreign statesmen sought reassurance on this point.
                            Vice President pointed out that under type of pressure characteristic of
                            October Cuban crisis it was not easy to forecast how even most confident
                            individuals might react. <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName>
                            replied that if Cuba had led to war, all policies and all resolves would
                            have counted for naught.</p>
                        <p>Trade and aid problems—President <persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                >Kekkonen</persName> asked Vice President to bring to attention of
                            American Government question of <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                            competition with Finnish efforts to sell paper mill machinery to Turkey.
                            He explained Finnish grievance that after three years of negotiation,
                            when Turks were ready to agree to sale financed by a 10-year aid loan,
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> by offering 20 year credit at
                            lower interest had broken up negotiation. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SR1">Seppala</persName> confirmed President’s
                            statements.</p>
                        <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0525"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> continued that in another
                            similar case involving Pakistan, Finland feared repetition of this
                            episode.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RCT1">Rowan</persName> asserted <gloss
                                target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> not deliberately trying to undercut
                            Finland. We trying bolster specific sector Turkish economy. Turks had
                            indicated it not really economically desirable take short-term proposal
                            of Finns.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> stated Finland could not
                            perceive logic in US urging other developed countries to help LDCs and
                            then wasting its own resources by undercutting aid attempts so inspired.
                            Finland would like to take matter up in Washington through Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_SR1">Seppala</persName> and perhaps by sending
                            special emissary to hold talks with US Government.</p>
                        <p>Vice President expressed his willingness to set up such meeting. He
                            stated American policy in case of Turkish paper mill was that issue was
                            for Turks to decide. If Turkey preferred to change from an inefficient
                            government paper mill to privately owned one, that was its privilege.
                            However, Vice President said, whichever choice was made there should be
                            opportunity for Finnish bids to be offered. <persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                >Kekkonen</persName> agreed this policy was reasonable. It might be
                            that Turkish mill matter was too far along to be reversed, but he hoped
                            that discussions could avoid future problems. Vice President then
                            reaffirmed American willingness to discuss matter fully in Washington,
                            which <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> agreed to
                            gratefully.</p>
                        <p>Turning briefly to other trade matters, <persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                >Kekkonen</persName> stated that Finnish trade figures during last
                            two years showed good progress. Vice President jokingly declared that if
                            such successful roving salesman as <persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                >Kekkonen</persName> visited America again, America’s balance of
                            payments might be damaged to such degree we would have to seek Finnish
                            aid. <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> interjected
                            humorously that he hoped this would take place. Vice President expressed
                            US intention to send trade mission to Finland in May 1964 and to study
                            possibility of participation in a trade fair in Finland in September
                            1964.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> welcomed this news,
                            pointing out also that during 1961 US share of Finland’s trade rose from
                            seventh place to fifth, surpassing France and Netherlands. Vice
                            President noted that last year US imported $60 million worth of Finnish
                            goods and exported $58 million worth. Vice President also noted that
                            trade is great tool of freedom, explaining that this was why liberal
                            trade policy was essential part of American foreign policy.
                            Protectionism was incompatible with these principles, for which
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had fought so
                            successfully in last year’s Trade Expansion Act.</p>
                        <p>Post test-ban treaty prospects—Vice President then solicited <persName
                                corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName>’s evaluation of Soviets’
                            attitude since signature of test-ban treaty, paying tribute to <persName
                                corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName>’s experience with Soviets.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> expressed his opinion
                            forcefully that treaty indicated considerable change <pb n="504"
                                xml:id="pg_504" facs="0526"/>in political atmosphere in USSR.
                            Adzhubei in his visit to Finland earlier in week had confirmed this
                            also. In <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName>’s opinion,
                            Soviet fear of horrible war had forced them to abandon it as tool of
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>Pointing out that the sobering effect of the Cuban crisis on both Eastern
                            and Western leaders, the Vice President asked whether it or the crisis
                            in USSR-Chinese Communist relations had contributed to this change.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> responded that Cuban
                            crisis had brought Soviet leaders to edge of abyss and they saw they
                            could not continue on prior course. Split with Chinese Communists had
                            helped too. <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> believed turn
                            away from military solutions was fundamental change in Soviet
                            attitude.</p>
                        <p>He quoted Adzhubei as saying <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> had “turned Soviet policy completely around.”
                                <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> was confident Soviets
                            would not use violence against Finland. Therefore, Finland must
                            strengthen its economy to prevent USSR undercutting democracy’s appeal
                            with workers. Vice President reminded him that this entailed also
                            watching constantly to avoid becoming dependent on USSR in fuel supply
                            or in any other field. <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName>
                            replied that Finland naturally aware of this. He pointed out that
                            Finland’s trade with Soviet bloc constituted less than 20 percent of
                            total trade.</p>
                        <p>Vice President inquired whether Finnish Communist Party was likely to
                            profit from post-test-ban treaty atmosphere. <persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                >Kekkonen</persName> replied to contrary. Many of non-Communist
                            parties expected to gain more. Finnish Communists had not gained
                            prestige from treaty. In fact, because of Soviet-ChiCom split it had
                            great trouble within itself; only recently had pro-ChiCom old guard been
                            defeated and party brought firmly to Soviet side in this dispute.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> stated that Soviets
                            never deal with Finnish Government through Finnish Party. Finnish
                            Communists resented this treatment and at recent Party rally someone in
                            the rear had shouted accusation that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> was toying with workers and dealing behind
                            their backs with non-Communists.</p>
                        <p>As to USSR’s next step after treaty, <persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                >Kekkonen</persName> forecast that Soviets would press for agreement
                            on plan to prevent surprise attacks and for Warsaw Pact–<gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> non-aggression pact. He added that
                            German question of course remained on agenda. Asked which treaty Soviets
                            would seek first, <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said
                            that he could not predict, but he believed they were moving steadily
                            toward both and that if satisfactory arrangements were made in these
                            fields, German question could probably be deferred. On other hand if no
                            progress were made German question would become acute.</p>
                        <p>Questioned by the Vice President about [garble—Sov?] attitude in recent
                            months following Cuban crisis, <persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                >Kekkonen</persName> remarked that Adzhubei had shown great
                            appreciation for President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                                >Kennedy</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName>
                            had been surprised at emphasis Adzhubei had given this view. <pb n="505"
                                xml:id="pg_505" facs="0527"/><persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                >Kekkonen</persName> had concluded in view of this circumstance that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>’s untiring and
                            responsible search for world peace had made great contribution and was
                            finding sure response.</p>
                        <p>Other topics—Vice President commended Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SR1">Seppala</persName>’s services to US-Finnish
                            relations and congratulated Finnish Government on Finland’s record in
                            the UN. Vice President expressed deep appreciation for warm welcome
                            given him and his party by Finland’s government, people, and press.</p>
                        <p>Vice President concluded meeting by concisely summarizing topics covered
                            and consensus reached, which <persName corresp="#p_KU1"

                            with the Secretary a year earlier concerning the Finnish desire for
                            modification of the Peace Treaty to permit acquisition of missiles.<note

                            <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0528"/>and of Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> personally in helping the matter to
                            satisfactory conclusion, through the purchase of air-to-air missiles
                            from the USSR and anti-tank missiles from the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Finnish Government has no present plans for further purchases of this
                            kind, because of its financial difficulties. The Foreign Minister
                            emphasized, however, that the ability to acquire the missiles had a
                            tremendously important effect on morale, and in Finland it was almost
                            more significant than the actual military improvement.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted that we had no objection once we were assured that
                            there were no security problems in the technology being transferred by
                            the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. The use of its own resources was
                            the business of the Finnish Government, but the Secretary mentioned the
                            possible declining significance of certain kinds of weapons, as manned
                            aircraft give way to missiles. The Foreign Minister said that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> had been thinking
                            along similar lines.</p>
                        <p>After raising two specific subjects (see separate memoranda of
                                conversation)<note n="2" xml:id="d245fn2">See the source note
                                above.</note> the Foreign Minister said he wanted to hear the
                            Secretary’s views concerning prospects in East-West relations. He had
                            received the impression during his visit to the Soviet Union in August
                            that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was optimistic and
                            seriously wanted progress in talks with the West.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that “we stand on the leading edge of important
                            events” but there is no certainty of their direction. They could lead
                            toward a long term detente or to a heightening crisis as a result of
                            Moscow–Peking and East-West tensions. We certainly have no detente as
                            long as the hard core problems of Laos, Viet-Nam, Cuba and Berlin
                            persist. We do have a hunting license for a detente and we are prepared
                            to use it, as we think the USSR is also. The question is whether we are
                            each prepared to move forward on the same subjects or whether we might
                            “occupy each other’s rears”.</p>
                        <p>As examples, the Secretary mentioned both multilateral and bilateral
                            areas open to discussion. He noted that the USSR has not said whether a
                            non-aggression pact would apply to Berlin, and that no real basis for
                            rapprochement in Berlin or in Germany has been found, although the
                            atmosphere has improved. Some points, such as observation posts and
                            bombs in orbit, would be of relatively minor significance but might help
                            to maintain momentum.</p>
                        <p>Among the bilateral subjects for possible US–USSR discussion, the
                            Secretary mentioned trade, although the Soviets do not produce much that
                            we need; a consular agreement, which is now under discussion in Moscow;
                            exchange of commercial air rights; or broadened exchanges in <pb n="507"
                                xml:id="pg_507" facs="0529"/>such fields as agriculture, science,
                            medicine, and possibly a joint trip to the moon. The Secretary was
                            dining the same evening with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> and might discuss these as well as Laos, where
                            there is reason to believe the Soviets no longer have decisive influence
                            on the ground, and Cuba where some steady withdrawals of personnel have
                            not eliminated the large number there.</p>
                        <p>In reply to the Secretary’s question whether the recent developments in
                            East-West relations might be the result of long-term or short-term
                            calculation by the Soviets, the Foreign Minister replied that he
                            expected the trend to continue for some time and that his personal hunch
                            was that the Soviet desire for peace is genuine. He contrasted Soviet
                            domestic emphasis on peace with the well-known Chinese Communist
                            position.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether the Sino-Soviet split had produced internal
                            repercussions among communist groups in Finland. The Foreign Minister
                            replied that if there were any difficulties previously, the split had
                            not been decisive and the communists in Finland were now completely on
                            the Soviet line. Ambassador Enckell noted that there had been some
                            delay, however, in announcing this allegiance. In reply to the
                            Secretary’s question, the Foreign Minister said that Finnish relations
                            with Eastern European countries were developing. He felt that any
                            improvement in the living standard in the Soviet Union would increase
                            desires for personal freedom, tending to alleviate the harshness of the
                            Soviet system both internally and in relation with the smaller Eastern
                            European countries. Nationalism in Eastern Europe was also growing and
                            the Finns were breathing more easily because of these developments.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister added that Finland did not wish to speculate, in
                            terms of its own policies, on the possible effects of the Sino-Soviet
                            split. The Secretary commented that the Soviets and the Chinese
                            Communists were both capable of sudden reversals of policies. The
                            Foreign Minister repeated that he was unable to fathom the reasons for
                            the extreme Chicom position, whether it was purely ideological or the
                            result of other factors. The Secretary concluded that the FM may have
                            found the reasons in his earlier comment about freedom, that the Chinese
                            Communists might be right from the party point of view, in that their
                            system might not be capable of surviving peaceful coexistence.</p>

                                (Department of State, Central Files, POL 1 US)</note> and that he
                            did so. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> reportedly was
                            pleased to have <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName>’s report,
                            and both <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> emphasized their desire to
                            continue to cooperate with the United States and the West.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said that the first thing
                            that impressed him was <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                            >Khrushchev</persName>’s good physical condition. At Novosibirsk in 1961
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had seemed ill and
                            fatigued. During this visit he hunted with great vigor and joked almost
                            incessantly. <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> concluded
                            that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> apparently will
                            be around awhile. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RCT1"
                                >Rowan</persName> said that this was good to hear in as much as we
                            know of no one on the Soviet scene who is certain to be any more
                            reasonable than <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said he watched closely
                            when <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was in the midst
                            of Mikoyan, Kosygin, Malinovsky, Kozlov, Podgorny, and Polyansky and
                            concluded that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is in
                            “complete control.” He said <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> joked and talked freely, seeming to hold back
                            nothing. He said <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            appeared to be a man completely secure in his position. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> contrasted earlier visits when
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> talked at length
                            about Molotov and “the anti-Party group” and felt it necessary to
                            explain at great length his opposition to the Stalinists. This time
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> seemed totally
                            unworried by the anti-Party group.</p>
                        <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0531"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said that for the first
                            time he felt free to question <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> about Stalin, and that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> talked very freely and
                            frankly. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that
                            during Stalin’s last years the latter was mentally ill and hardly ever
                            left the Kremlin. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said
                            that in 1951 he and Mikoyan were on a trip with Stalin when the latter
                            often said, “I don’t trust anyone, not even myself!” <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said he and Mikoyan later
                            got together and agreed that “those were not the words of a sane
                            man.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> also discussed the
                            Sino-Soviet split with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            who asserted that there is no real ideological difference, not even on
                            the question of peaceful co-existence. But <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> and other Soviet leaders admitted that they
                            are befuddled by the strangely belligerent tone with which Red China
                            states her position. <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said
                            Red China troubles the Soviet Union “and will continue to do so for a
                            long time.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said his talks with
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> were less directed
                            to current burning political issues than was the case in the past,
                            largely because <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> seemed
                            preoccupied with the coming meeting of the Central Committee. Thus,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> talked at length
                            about Soviet domestic affairs. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> said the Soviet Union will abandon the
                            Kolkhoz (collective farming system) and move to a state farm system.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that only the
                            “human factor” prevented him from ordering even more drastic
                            changes.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RCT1">Rowan</persName> asked if
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> indicated from
                            what sector of the economy he would divert resources for the economic
                            reform programs he recently announced. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_RCT1">Rowan</persName> explained that he was interested
                            in whether the Soviets might of necessity be less interested in an arms
                            race and perhaps a bit more interested in some meaningful steps toward
                            disarmament and world peace.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had mentioned the cost of 42
                            billion rubles over a period of seven years, and had said that if the
                            West refused to grant the credits for the machinery and other items
                            necessary in the Soviet economic program, the program would go forward
                            because the Soviets would divert resources from their own economy.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> did not specify which sector
                            of the economy, but that he stated emphatically that the Soviet Union
                            needed peace in which to get its economy in order and to the point where
                            it could compete more effectively with the capitalistic nations. He said
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> placed great
                            emphasis on scientific education.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RCT1">Rowan</persName> asked if, in
                            discussing the new <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                            Administration, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had
                            mentioned any problem areas where he was particularly concerned, such as
                            Cuba, or Berlin, or if, in discussing the Soviet Union’s need for peace,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had given any idea
                            as to <pb n="510" xml:id="pg_510" facs="0532"/>the areas in which the
                            Soviets were ready to make new steps toward peace.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had simply indicated that
                            his policy on Berlin had not changed, but had indicated that the Soviet
                            Union was not taking any steps that might precipitate a crisis.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RCT1">Rowan</persName> said there was
                            considerable confusion in Scandinavia as to whether <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> planned to visit Finland as
                            part of his Scandinavian tour next year. <persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                >Kekkonen</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> will probably visit Finland but not when he
                            visits the other Scandinavian countries. He said that when the other
                            Scandinavian countries indicated next June would be suitable, Finland
                            had offered the same time in the interest of Scandinavian solidarity,
                            but that to visit four countries on the same trip apparently involves
                            too much time to suit <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                            >Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said he wished he had more
                            to report, but that his journey turned out to be even more of a hunting
                            trip than he had expected. He said there was less political talk than on
                            any of his trips to the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> said that it was
                            interesting to note that his proposal for a Scandinavian nuclear free
                            zone was never mentioned in his talks with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> and was not even mentioned until the two of
                            them referred to it publicly. He said that both he and <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> apparently felt the matter
                            had been discussed conclusively in the public forum, and that there was
                            no need for them to take it up.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RCT1">Rowan</persName> said that he had
                            taken note of <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName>’s feeling
                            that some circles looked upon him with suspicion for making the
                            proposal. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RCT1">Rowan</persName> said
                            that his government looked with disfavor upon the proposal, but not
                            because of a belief that <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName>
                            had made it with evil intent or because of a desire to do <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s bidding. There was reason
                            enough for the United States to disfavor the proposal because it is an
                            unnecessary disturbance of the power balance in Northern Europe. “We can
                            understand and appreciate your making a proposal that you think is in
                            Finland’s interest,” Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RCT1"
                                >Rowan</persName> added, “just as I am sure that you can understand
                            our reluctance to see any proposal put forward that would affect Norway
                            and Denmark in such a way as to disturb deeply the situation in this
                            part of the world.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName> switched back to his
                            Moscow discussions, asserting that “everything seemed to be in order in
                            the Soviet Union” and he found great confidence in the prospect of
                            maintaining peace.</p>
                        <p>“I began to talk about the new <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                                >Johnson</persName> Administration and about any possible changes in
                            the US posture,” <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName>
                            chuckled, “then I discovered that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> had just read the US News and World Report
                            article on which I was basing my assessments.”</p>
                        <pb n="511" xml:id="pg_511" facs="0533"/>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RCT1">Rowan</persName> suggested that
                            under those circumstances President <persName corresp="#p_KU1"
                                >Kekkonen</persName> might want to join him in a resolution to give
                            up reading newspapers and magazines. “You know that they almost wrote me
                            out of Finland while you were away,” said the Ambassador. “Yes,” said
                                <persName corresp="#p_KU1">Kekkonen</persName>, “and it all prompts
                            me to say that there is never smoke unless there is some fire.”</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador replied that he had every expectation that he would spend
                            a quiet winter by the firesides of Finland, for he knew of no plans of
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> to call him to
                            Washington, though press speculation may suggest a recall.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Rossides</persName> extended
                            congratulations to the Secretary on his appointment, and expressed
                            gratification with regard to the foreign policy positions taken by the
                            new Administration. He considered it essential to adhere to moral
                            principles in international relations, and felt the United States could
                            and should provide moral leadership for the Free World.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then stated that he wanted to explain briefly to the
                            Secretary the problems of Cyprus. The London–Zurich Agreements which
                            created the Republic were in many ways divisive.<note n="1"

                            to live. The problems which this caused were compounded by economic
                            difficulties. <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Archbishop
                                Makarios</persName> was a strong and effective leader, but he needed

                            which Cyprus had just concluded a technical cooperation agreement.<note

                            aid. In this connection he understood that a proposed Technical
                            Cooperation Agreement between the United States and Cyprus was now
                            awaiting approval in the Department.<note n="3" xml:id="d247fn3">For

                        <p>The Secretary replied that this matter was well advanced and that we
                            hoped to be able to do something very soon. The Secretary then inquired
                            concerning the status of the Thorp Report on the Cypriot economy.<note
                                n="4" xml:id="d247fn4">Reference is to the report of a U.N. Economic
                                Survey team, headed by Willard Thorp, provided to President

                                1960.</note></p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Rossides</persName> replied that
                            publication of the Report was expected in the near future. He thought
                            the Report generally a good one, but felt that it overestimated
                            indigenous Cypriot investment capabilities. While there were Cypriots
                            with investment capital, they were reluctant to take the lead. In his
                            opinion, it would first be necessary to obtain outside help in order to
                            encourage Cypriot investment. The Secretary commented that, in his
                            opinion, it was psychologically important for the Cypriots themselves to
                            set the example by investing in their country’s economic future. The
                            Ambassador agreed but said that unfortunately private individuals tended
                            to think first of their private interests. What was needed was to find a
                            middle way, with investment capital coming from both Cypriot and outside
                            sources.</p>
                        <p>Areas in which help was particularly needed, the Ambassador said, were
                            port improvement and the development of water resources. Since Cyprus
                            was basically an agricultural country, development in these fields was
                            necessary in order to expand agricultural production and the facilities
                            for exporting agricultural products. The Thorp Report stated that the
                            water development program could be domestically financed, but the
                            Ambassador doubted that this was possible.</p>
                        <p>In response to the Secretary’s question concerning the status of Cypriot
                            Commonwealth membership, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RZ1"
                                >Rossides</persName> explained the political and constitutional
                            background of the parliamentary decision to apply for membership for a
                            five year period, and opined that Cyprus would soon become a member.
                            During a recent discussion with Prime Minister Macmillan, he had
                            gathered that there were no obstacles to the acceptance of Cyprus as a
                            full Commonwealth member.</p>
                        <p>As the Ambassador was leaving, the Secretary expressed gratification with
                            regard to the Cypriot delegation’s role during the fall session of the
                            General Assembly, to which the Ambassador was his country’s chief
                            delegate. The Ambassador thanked the Secretary and commented <pb n="514"
                                xml:id="pg_514" facs="0536"/>that he had been particularly pleased
                            by the United States position when the Congo question last came before

                        <p>Perhaps we need some preventive medicine here to forestall further
                            deterioration of this situation. Shouldn’t we at a minimum push the

                            forthcoming approach? Moreover, in view of their limited resources, we
                            should carefully review our own policy of relying on these guarantor
                            powers to shoulder the principal share of the Western burden.</p>
                        <p>Since Cyprus’ real estate and strategic location are of considerable
                            importance to us and to our allies, I would be grateful if the

                            our holding on to it, including whatever use of US resources may be
                            required.</p>

                            developments in Cyprus, the paper recommends that the United States
                            should assume a more active role in Cyprus than in the past, a role of
                            leadership amongst the Western nations in preserving and strengthening
                            Western interests on the island. One of the principal reasons for
                            recommending this policy shift is the need to retain our strategically
                            important communications facilities.</p>

                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that Cyprus needs outside assistance to carry
                            out its five-year development program. It is self-financing about 30
                            million pounds for the period and needs external aid of about 32 million
                            pounds. Cyprus hopes to be completely self-sustaining in seven to ten
                            years, provided it can get its plan financed and operative.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we have re-organized our approach to aid. We have
                            put the responsibility on our Ambassadors in the field who are equipped
                            to aid new countries explore the sources available to them. We also want
                            to see the new nations turning to the Western European countries,
                            especially towards those who had been associated with them in the past.
                            We do not want our aid to replace that formerly given by others but
                            rather to supplement their assistance.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that they were exploring these sources. He did
                            not expect much from the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. Some
                            assistance has been received from the Federal Republic. There are some
                            pressures in Cyprus, which the Government is resisting, to accept aid
                            from the Soviets, who have already made offers. The Government is
                            confident the US will help, however. It hopes that assistance will be
                            bilateral as well as through a consortium; bilateral assistance from the
                            US will have a significant political impact.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we would take account of these suggestions. The
                            attitude of the Bank would be of great importance. If the Cypriot
                            Government convinces the Bank that it has a logical plan, this would
                            affect <pb n="520" xml:id="pg_520" facs="0542"/>favorably the attitude
                            of governments. He expressed the hope that the Cypriot people themselves
                            would be seized with the idea of development. It’s a persuasive argument
                            for aid when the people themselves are moving. He asked the order of
                            priorities.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that water is the immediate problem. Extensive
                            surveys are needed. Much of the development plan money will initially go
                            into water projects. Later the mines can be developed. Other projects
                            include a new port and the improvement of tourist accommodations.
                            Finally, agriculture must be modernized and perhaps transformed into the
                            production of more exportable commodities.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that tourism could be a most profitable resource. He
                            suggested Cyprus try to attract international meetings. We will try to
                            get conclusions soon on assistance. In the meantime, Cyprus should
                            present its plans to the Bank and talk to other countries in Europe,

                        <p>Foreign Minister expressed appreciation of our interest and went on to
                            stress <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> believed that
                            as President he could not permit obstruction of functioning of state if
                            Turkish Cypriots utilized tax veto provision to force pace of
                            implementation of constitution to disadvantage of Greek Cypriots.<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d255fn2">The Cypriot Constitution gave the Turkish

                                permanently setting tax rates. The Turkish Cypriots insisted that
                                any tax bill must be on an annual or biannual renewal basis.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> had responsibility for

                        <p>Foreign Minister added <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName>
                            was making efforts to discuss matters with Turkish Cypriots and had
                            recently talked with leader of Turkish Cypriot rebel group in House re
                            tax matters. Foreign Minister thought some Turkish Cypriots now believed
                            they had gone too far and would be more reasonable on additional tax
                            legislation pending in House. Foreign Minister drew distinction between
                            more moderate Turkish Cypriots under <persName corresp="#p_KF1"
                                >Kutchuk</persName> and more radical ones under <persName

                                corresp="#p_KF1">Kutchuk</persName> had always been helpful, but
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR2">Denktash</persName> and company seemed
                            convinced only hope for Turkish Cypriots lay in separating themselves
                            from Greek Cypriots to widest extent possible.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister thought <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would best
                            be able to persuade Turkish Cypriots to see reason and suggested it
                            would be helpful if US would use its influence in Ankara to this end. I
                            replied that although we were not guarantor power, we wanted to be
                            helpful and were in fact urging restraint and moderation in Ankara and
                            Athens as we were here. Foreign Minister commented that he hoped we
                            might go step further and express opinion on substance of current
                            dispute in support of <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName>

                            of forcing pace through tax veto was harmful. Foreign Minister concluded
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> could really help by urging
                            Turkish Cypriot rebel group to abandon opposition and cooperate with

                        <p>The President then turned to the subject of aid, saying we are eager to
                            help Cyprus, although our balance of payments problems and our defense
                                <pb n="526" xml:id="pg_526" facs="0548"/>requirements impose heavy
                            burdens upon us. We are now spending $3 billion for defense, one-half of
                            which goes to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. We also have the
                            problem of obtaining sufficient money from Congress to do what we would
                            like to do. He hopes that European nations will assume an increasingly
                            larger share of the aid program.</p>
                        <p>He understood that in Cyprus the problem had been partly one of a lack of
                            proper planning and that the <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Archbishop</persName> might feel we had been rather slow. He then
                            asked Mr. <persName>Gaud</persName> to summarize the aid situation as he
                            saw it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Gaud</persName> said that he believed the <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Archbishop</persName> would agree that there is
                            a very satisfactory understanding between the <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Archbishop</persName> on the one hand, and our
                            Ambassador and Mission Director on the other, as to our aid program and
                            problems. Our program consists primarily of PL 480 and Technical
                            Assistance—much of the latter in the planning field. Steps are underway
                            to move from planning into projects and we are ready to examine whatever
                            projects the Cypriots develop and see whether we can help with them.</p>
                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Archbishop</persName> declared that
                            water was the main problem. There had been a delay in deciding what to
                            do in this field, but he hoped he would soon be ready to move. He was
                            not looking for any radical solution. He is thinking of changing the
                            island’s legislation so as to nationalize water and control pumping. A
                            geological survey is needed, decisions must be reached as to where dams
                            should be built and experimental drilling is in order. He hopes that
                            projects in this and other fields will be ready for discussions
                            soon.</p>
                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Archbishop</persName> then stated that
                            he was optimistic about the future of Cyprus. He hopes to make the
                            island less dependent on agriculture by developing appropriate
                            industries. An oil refinery and a fertilizer plant are now under
                            discussion. Tourism is growing and the necessary accommodations—such as
                            a new Hilton Hotel in Nicosia—are in prospect.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that it would be a fine thing if desalinized water
                            could be produced at a commercial rate. The <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Archbishop</persName> agreed and pointed out
                            that the British are putting up a plant in their base area. It is his
                            understanding that at the present time, water can be produced at rates
                            appropriate for drinking but not for irrigation. He has resisted the
                            efforts of some experts who have tried to convince him that he should
                            build several desalinization plants near the sea. He prefers to wait and
                            see if the British plant succeeds.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WF1">Wilkins</persName> suggested that
                            the Office of Saline Water might take another look at Cyprus and see
                            what, if anything, they thought could be done along this line. The
                            President agreed that this might be desirable.</p>

                        <p>The President opened with the comment that he knew our people had been
                            speaking with the <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Archbishop</persName>’s
                            government about establishing a <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>
                            transmitter in Cyprus, and he hoped the <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Archbishop</persName> would be able to consider the suggestion
                            sympathetically. <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Archbishop
                                Makarios</persName> replied that personally he would like very much
                            to approve the request. However, he must consider seriously the
                            political implications. There were some fears that if the Government of
                            Cyprus agreed to this proposal some other countries would no longer view
                            it as being non-aligned. Apart from that one fear, he would like to have
                            the installation in Cyprus “especially as I have been told that it would
                            be established in my own region.” With a twinkle he added that this
                            might be the main reason that would weigh in the balance when he came to
                            a decision. The President thanked him for his willingness to weigh all
                            the factors, adding that, as he had said in their previous session, he
                            appreciated the Cypriot hospitality to our other communications on the
                            island, without which we would be in difficulties with our
                            communications farther east.</p>
                        <p>The President and the <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Archbishop</persName>
                            agreed to the text of a communique to be issued at the conclusion of
                            their talks.<note n="1" xml:id="d260fn1">For text of the communique, see

                            in economic assistance matters the United States too knew how to remain
                            “uncommitted.” Mr. <persName>Gaud</persName> reviewed the conversation
                            between the <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Archbishop</persName> and Mr.
                                <persName>Hamilton</persName>, who had discussed the various kinds
                            of aid relationships. He thought everything was now on the tracks,
                            including an assurance that we will do something about the water
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed himself as pleased with the Secretary of Labor’s
                            statement at luncheon that a labor leaders’ exchange program has been
                            arranged between Cyprus and the United States.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d260fn3">Apparently a statement made to President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> by Secretary of Labor
                                Arthur Goldberg during the luncheon at Blair House hosted by the
                                President.</note> A free and active labor movement contributes not
                            only to the welfare of its members, but also helps society generally.
                            The Foreign Minister mentioned in this connection that the Government of
                            Cyprus regarded the establishment of a social insurance program as very
                            important. He noted that the question of getting foreign assistance for
                            this program had been raised with the <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                >AID</gloss> officials. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RZ1"
                                >Rossides</persName> added that the Government of Cyprus was also
                            very much interested in having an American University established in
                            Cyprus. He pointed out that in their view it would bring a useful
                            Western influence into Cyprus and would have a beneficial effect on the
                            local community by bringing Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots into the
                            same classes. He said that students might also be brought from
                            neighboring countries to attend classes. In response to a question by
                            the President, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WF1">Wilkins</persName>
                            commented that this was a complicated matter that would need exploration
                            before we could decide what could be done. Some had suggested that
                            consulting the American University in Beirut might be useful. The
                            President agreed that this might be a good thing to do.</p>
                        <p>Before the <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Archbishop</persName> left to
                            meet with Senators and Representatives on Capitol Hill, he and the
                            President exchanged expressions of warm satisfaction that the <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Archbishop</persName> had come to this country
                            and that they had opportunity for friendly and useful talks.</p>
                        <p>As the meeting broke up President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                                >Kennedy</persName> instructed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1"
                                >Talbot</persName> and Mr. <persName>Gaud</persName> to pursue the
                            questions of possible American help to the social insurance scheme and
                            the American University scheme to an early decision, so that the
                            Cypriots would get one answer or the other and not be left long in
                            suspense.</p>

                            officials. In NSAM 98<note n="1" xml:id="d261fn1"><ref target="#d250"
                                    >Document 250</ref>.</note> last September he endorsed the State
                            Department’s <hi rend="italic">Proposals for US Action in Cyprus</hi>
                            which called for development of an aid program that would give us “the
                            key role” in assisting Cypriot economic development. He realizes that
                            the inexperience of the Cypriot Government has hampered this effort and
                            that it is difficult to find as yet development projects suitable for
                            loan support. However, with the prospect of an improved Cypriot effort
                            following President <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName>’
                            return, he would like to see our program take definite shape just as
                            soon as feasible. We should also do all we reasonably can toward aiding
                            and encouraging the Cyprus Government to cope with its serious Communist
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, the President is anxious that we give the Cypriots answers
                            as quickly as possible to suggestions they raised during President
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName>’

                            development. Will you therefore report to him by 13 July what progress
                            you feel we have made as a result of the visit and what follow-up steps
                            we are taking to get our aid program moving?</p>

                        <p>We believe the <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> visit
                            strengthened our prestige and influence in Cyprus and furthered specific
                            U.S. objectives for the island. The goodwill the visit generated has, in
                            our opinion, improved our prospects for continued undisturbed access to
                            our communications facilities. <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Makarios</persName> returned to the island convinced of the need to
                            act on our <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> proposal and asked the
                            Cypriot Council of Ministers for a decision. The prospects for early
                            approval seem good. During the visit we were also able to persuade
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> of the need for
                            more effective Cypriot planning for economic development, a basic
                            requirement for the strong US aid program we expect to mount during
                            coming months.</p>
                        <p>In more general terms, the visit served as a public affirmation of our
                            intention to play an active and constructive role in Cypriot affairs, a
                            policy first enunciated in NSAM 98 of September 25, 1961.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d262fn2"><ref target="#d250">Document 250</ref>.</note> This
                            intent has now been recognized and gratefully accepted by all sectors of
                            the Cypriot public except the communists. As a result, we believe our
                            prestige and influence in Cyprus are at an all-time high.</p>
                        <p>Vital U.S. interests—our communications facilities, the need to counter
                            the communist threat, and preservation of peaceful relations between the
                            Greek and Turkish communities—require us to maintain our influence at a
                            high level. For this purpose our most immediately applicable instrument
                            of policy is our economic aid program. We believe this program is
                            developing into an effective means of advancing both short term and long
                            term U.S. objectives on the island. Annex 1 summarizes recent progress
                            toward giving tangible shape and substance to our aid program, as well
                            as further steps we propose to take during the next several months.</p>

                        <p>As to the specific projects discussed during the visit and cited in NSAM
                            169: <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> is providing technical
                            assistance in the field of water development and is considering a loan
                            for heavy equipment to be used in part for the Cypriot water program. We
                            have indicated the improbability of our being able to fund their social
                            insurance project but are implementing our commitment to provide
                            technical assistance for it. An <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                            expert has completed a preliminary investigation in Cyprus of the
                            possibility of establishing an American-sponsored educational
                            institution. His principal conclusions are that any such effort should
                            initially be on a modest scale, and further study is necessary. <gloss
                                target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> is currently reviewing the proposal and
                            consulting private foundations and educational institutions, preparatory
                            to discussing the matter with the Cypriots in more specific terms.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> has increased the scope of its
                            Cyprus program recently and has assigned first priority to that program
                            for any augmented appropriations available to the Near Eastern area
                            operations of the Agency in FY ’63. (See Annex 2)</p>
                        <p>A major facet of our present policy in Cyprus is to encourage other
                            Western countries and international lending organizations to contribute
                            more actively toward building up a dominant Western presence on the
                            island. The IBRD, with our encouragement, has offered substantial
                            amounts of loan capital for the Cypriot economic development program,
                            and the West Germans have, on their own initiative, committed themselves
                            to a sizable aid program. During the past year we have consulted
                            frequently with the Governments of the Guarantor Powers (the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Greece and Turkey) on our common
                            problems and objectives in Cyprus. We believe this consultation has
                            contributed to the fact that the Greek and Turkish Governments are now
                            consulting regularly with each other and cooperating closely on Cypriot
                            affairs, and in particular are in complete agreement on the need to
                            support the existing constitutional framework. Given the continuing
                            impasse between the two communities on various constitutional issues,
                            this cooperation between Athens and Ankara is most important. We intend
                            to explore further with the Greek, Turkish, and British Governments, as
                            well as with appropriate Cypriot leaders, ways and means by which our
                            joint influence can be brought to bear to create areas of agreement
                            between the two communities and to discourage efforts of some Cypriots
                            to upset the existing constitutional order.</p>
                        <p>Two of the aid projects we are currently beginning to implement—the
                            police training program and the labor program—are specifically designed
                            to increase Cypriot capabilities for resisting communist subversion. On
                            the diplomatic level, we intend to continue our efforts to persuade
                            President <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> and other
                            Cypriot leaders to pursue more active anti-communist policies, following
                            up the President’s remarks on <pb n="532" xml:id="pg_532" facs="0554"

                            radical stiffening in <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName>’
                            policies in this regard, we hope that our efforts will have a
                            significant cumulative effect over coming months. Already there are
                            signs the Cypriot Government is planning increased support for the
                            anti-communist wing of the labor movement.</p>

                            Vice President noted both US and Cyprus were new countries and thus had
                            many similar problems.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> said that Cyprus was
                            greatly honored by <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>’s
                            visit and that <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss>, although

                                >VP</gloss> was first, was making every effort to make his short

                                >Makarios</persName> continued that although they had perhaps set
                            out in the right way on their development program he personally thought
                            they were moving too slowly and that they must pick up speed. <persName

                        <p>Vice President noted danger of growing Communist threat for next election
                            in 1965, and suggested need for <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Makarios</persName> to organize a non-Communist party, reminding
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> of success
                            Communist tactics in other countries.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> spoke at some length
                            about political parties in Cyprus to the effect that only left was
                            organized, in AKEL, the Communist Party, and PEO, the left wing labor
                            movement. The right wing, he said, was not organized, in fact each Greek
                            was a political leader of his own political party as was case in Greece.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> said he could not
                            lead a political party, in response to <gloss target="#t_VP1"
                            >VP</gloss>’s question, because he was of the Church and was President
                            of Cyprus, and that he must be above politics—but added that his
                            successor might well come from a political party. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> said that when
                                <persName>John Clerides</persName> of the Orthodox Right had run for
                            President against him in 1959 he had had Communist support and had
                            commanded 33 per cent of the vote in the Greek Cypriot community. At
                            same time <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> did not
                            think that all of this 33 per cent were true Communists but merely
                            temporary followers of a well organized party and that, in fact,
                            Communist strength was decreasing. What was important, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> said, was that the Cyprus
                            development program move forward so that the general public would see
                            the benefits flowing from the present regime.</p>
                        <p>Vice President commented that situation seemed to be one which should be
                            watched with great care because, as had been the case in some other
                            countries, the democratic leaders had wakened one morning and found that
                            the Communists had taken over. <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> said we
                            would regret such a development in countries which were our friends.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> closed his eyes,
                            nodded, and said another party might be formed some day, but there was
                            plenty of time before the next elections.</p>
                        <p>Vice President mentioned <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> negotiations
                            now in progress, bringing out economic benefits accruing to Cyprus and
                            value of permitting world to hear unbiased news and facts.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> replied that matter
                            would be considered by the Council of Ministers before he departed for
                            Commonwealth Conference in London <pb n="534" xml:id="pg_534"
                                facs="0556"/>on September 9 and a decision reached. He said he must
                            consider this from two aspects: economic and political. He would not now
                            discuss economic side in detail except to say that he understands that
                            the US cannot help Cyprus as much as Cyprus would like. On political
                            side he said he had doubts of effect which <gloss target="#t_VOA1"
                                >VOA</gloss> station might have on Cyprus non-aligned policy.</p>
                        <p>He described Cyprus as extreme “right wing” of neutralist states. Other
                            neutral nations would no longer regard Cyprus as neutral, he remarked,
                            and Cyprus feels that it can be more effective on the international
                            scene and of help to the US with whom its true bonds lie, than if it
                            became merely another member of the Western bloc. He asked if Vice
                            President did not think that Cyprus should be non-aligned for this
                            reason.</p>
                        <p>Vice President replied that US wants only friendship and progress of
                            Cyprus but failed to see how providing facilities for broadcasting the
                            truth could damage Cypriot interests. <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Makarios</persName> said definition of difference between truth and
                            propaganda was matter individual interpretation. Said he himself doubted
                            that <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> agreement would be consistent
                            policy non-alignment.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WF1">Wilkins</persName> added that Ceylon, which
                            was generally considered more neutral than many, had only last spring
                            signed a new <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> agreement and also that
                            a <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> station in Cyprus would be called
                            an IBS or an International Broadcasting Service station consisting of
                            medium wave for Cyprus and short wave for us which might be heard in
                            Cyprus but could not be understood because it would be in Eastern
                            European, Central Asian and South Asian languages and the programs would
                            not indicate that the programs were coming from Cyprus but from
                            Washington through an Eastern Mediterranean station. In this context, he
                            said, a station in Cyprus will have no real effect on Cyprus non-aligned
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>Vice President, seconded by Mr. <persName>Komer</persName>, emphasized
                            decision could not be delayed for long, because US had other
                            opportunities obtain sites in the area, although we prefer Cyprus.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> said all points made by
                            Vice President were of interest and assured Vice President he would give
                            careful consideration to the matter during the coming week.</p>

                            stated US policy re Chinese representation urging support by Cyprus for

                                >VP</gloss> was a real friend and that he would do what he could for
                            Turk Cypriot minority if he understood facts. He turned to other Turk
                            leaders to present Turk Cypriot views orally.</p>
                        <p>Min Defense went over recent historical background Cyprus, pointing out
                            Turk Cypriots had given up their goal of partition and wanted make
                            concept bi-communal Cypriot nation work, while Greek Cypriots had
                            apparently not given up their goal of union with Greece. He said Turk
                            and Greek communities had made agreement to work together, and rules of
                            their cooperation in Cypriot nation, agreed to by both, were embodied in
                            provisions Constitution. Turk Cypriots wanted apply those rules, he
                            claimed, but Greeks unfortunately refused implement vital elements
                            Constitution to which they had agreed; this puts the Turkish community
                            in very serious position. Min Defense said Constitution obviously gave
                            Vice President important role in determining foreign policy, but
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> proceeded make
                            public declarations basic foreign policy of neutrality and non-alignment
                            without consulting Vice President. He complained of interminable delays
                            in formation Cypriot Army. Min Defense ended by saying Turk Cypriots
                            wanted US to understand their position and assist them.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DR2">Denktash</persName> said Turk Cypriots agreed
                            100 percent with <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss>’s remarks and
                            speeches on importance of independence and integrity of Cyprus. He
                            stated solution communal problem necessary prevent further spread
                            Communism in Cyprus. He added that to his surprise and horror, <pb
                                n="536" xml:id="pg_536" facs="0558"/>he had just discovered that
                            even Turk Cypriot community had been penetrated by Communists. A vital
                            Turk Cypriot community is an essential obstacle to the spread of
                            Communism in Cyprus, he said. The Greek majority, he claimed, keeps
                            pushing constantly on rights of Turk Cypriots, who feel selves being
                            gradually maneuvered into a corner. <persName corresp="#p_DR2"
                                >Denktash</persName> warned that if Turk Cypriots should find
                            themselves hopelessly cornered and deprived their rights, they might
                            react in blind desperation with unpredictable consequences. As years go
                            by, said <persName corresp="#p_DR2">Denktash</persName>, the two
                            communities will under good conditions slowly draw together in one
                            Cypriot community. Until that time, he warned, basis of government in
                            Cyprus must be bi-communal, not centralized in a Greek-dominated central
                            regime. He complained of failure central government implement separate
                            municipalities, 70–30 ratio in civil service, and alleged reduction
                            central revenues to Turkish education, alleging Greek Cypriots wanted
                            communal chambers to be forced levy heavier taxes in order reduce their
                            standing and support. <persName corresp="#p_DR2">Denktash</persName>
                            said Greek Cypriots refused entertain plan for national university.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WF1">Wilkins</persName> said <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> had not yet made a decision on this
                            subject.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DR2">Denktash</persName> also asked for US aid to
                            be channeled through communal chambers rather than through central
                            government. He claimed only such aid now was school food programs.</p>
                        <p>Vice President asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WF1"
                                >Wilkins</persName> about this and <persName corresp="#p_WF1"
                                >Wilkins</persName> said it was true because education alone was
                            officially in hands communal chambers instead of central regime.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> said US cannot act like Russians and
                            attempt impose our solutions on problems independent nation no matter
                            how much we might sympathize or not sympathize with one side of a
                            problem.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> promised read Turk Cypriot memorandum
                            and have responsible US officials study it carefully. <gloss
                                target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> promised that the US would continue to

                            re Communism and formation of right-wing political party and said that
                            this account hardly did justice to his views and to what he was trying
                            to do here.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> continued that he had
                            been trying to counter international Communist activities in Cyprus and
                            was preparing way for 1965 elections in Cyprus. Gist of <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName>’ argument was that many
                            Cypriot Communists were merely paying lip service to party and left-wing
                            labor union for present benefits and that since they were supporting
                            current <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> policies, it was preferable
                            to retain their cooperation than to risk factions and possibly armed
                            clashes within Greek Cypriot community. <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Makarios</persName> was convinced that Cypriot Communists did not
                            now pose any serious threat here and that if danger should subsequently
                            develop he would utilize any means to resolve matter.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> said: “There is no
                            doubt about my anti-Communist views. At same time I must make use of
                            them now and concentrate on making new Cypriot Government work and
                            getting economic development program under way. I cannot risk dissension
                            within Greek Cypriot community, but I will crush Communists if they try
                            to take over our democratic republic.” He said, for example, that former
                            EOKA fighters <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0561"/>continue
                            hell-bent to attack Cypriot Communists with force, but that he had with
                            difficulty restrained them in interests of peace in Cyprus.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> commented re right-wing
                            political party that we in US had well-established democratic system
                            with educated electorate and only two political parties; Cyprus did not
                            have well-established democratic system and many of its people were
                            unsophisticated politically. It was true Communists were organized; at
                            same time it was too early similarly to organize right wing because, as
                            in Greece, every Cypriot wanted to be political leader. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> feared that instead of one
                            right-wing political party there might be two or more. “What if one of
                            them were called ‘party for union with Greece’? Could I disavow such a
                            party or such a policy?”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> added that it would be
                            difficult for him as President and as <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Archbishop</persName> to engage directly in political affairs. For
                            time being it was preferable to handle matter indirectly until Cypriot
                            politicians themselves were conscious of need for single organization in
                            opposition to left-wing grouping. <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Makarios</persName> thought that this development would not take
                            place until eve of 1965 elections.</p>
                        <p>I recalled that, during conversation with <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Makarios</persName> last June, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had referred to Mao’s reliance
                            upon organization for successful political control and that Vice
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had said that
                            preparation for political elections could not be delayed until last
                            moment. I said that I would make known to Washington his analysis of
                            local situation and his judgment as to how it could best be handled.
                            Meanwhile we could continue to watch situation and work together.</p>

                            unworkable and that the Government of Cyprus would assume all the
                            legislative and administrative functions previously performed by the
                            separate municipalities. The Embassy commented: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    Turkish Cypriots. Turkish Communal Chamber passed a law December

                                representatives had expressed concern about the hardening of
                                positions by Greek and Turkish Cypriots and warned that Turkey would

                        <p>We continue to believe that prospect of politically viable Cyprus lies
                            not in inflexible constitutional provisions nor in solutions imposed
                            from abroad but in pragmatic adjustments of relations between two
                            communities and gradual development of Cypriot rather than communal
                            interests and values.</p>
                        <p>We believe at present that any effort by either party to draw us into
                            dispute should be politely but firmly rejected. We feel that belief on
                            part either community that it has solid foreign backing will discourage
                            compromise and encourage extremism.</p>
                        <p>It appears that efforts at solution should concentrate on informal
                            negotiation between communities and ad hoc, though perhaps awkward, <pb
                                n="541" xml:id="pg_541" facs="0563"/>accommodations. To the extent
                            either party uses formal legal procedures, positions will probably
                            harden. Thus Greek Cypriot action in legally dissolving municipalities
                            and Turk Cypriot reliance on letter of London–Zurich agreements cannot
                            be constructive in long range.</p>

                            They had discussed his recent visit to Ankara, but neither had mentioned

                            solution, within Constitution, by agreeing to joint boards and at same
                            time maintaining separate municipal councils. This was essence of
                            agreement immediately before Christmas, but <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> had subsequently insisted
                            there could be no separate municipal councils, and had endeavored to
                            place blame for breakdown of talks on <persName corresp="#p_KF1"
                                >Kutchuk</persName> by saying he had withdrawn his consent. Fact was
                                <persName corresp="#p_KF1">Kutchuk</persName> had never given
                            consent to abolishment of separate councils. Turkish Cypriot public
                            opinion would not accept this change at this stage.</p>

                            Constitution illustrated his policy since independence. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> had from beginning believed

                            and did not intend to let them have them. <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Makarios</persName> had also not permitted full implementation of
                            provisions relating to civil service, taxation and Cypriot Army. Greek
                            Cypriot officials had not withdrawn, as promised, civil service cases
                            pending before Constitutional Court, nor had Public Service Commission
                            functioned fairly. Turkish Cypriot rights relating to foreign affairs
                            and executive power were being set aside. Turkish Cypriots were
                            convinced that if they compromised with <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Makarios</persName> on municipalities, it would represent first

                            were anxious to discuss all of these matters with Greek Cypriots, but
                            had found <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> and other

                            proposals within scope of Constitution. They thought it might be
                            advisable first to discuss other unsettled issues and leave
                            municipalities until last and thus arrange some sort of package

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KF1">Kutchuk</persName> and Muftizade said they had
                            yesterday discussed these matters with British High Commissioner, who
                            had told them <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> was
                            still opposed to separate municipalities, but would not for time being
                            interfere with administration of Turkish Cypriot municipal councils.
                            British High Commissioner had favored, they said, their plans for
                            awaiting <persName corresp="#p_CG1">Clerides</persName>’ return and
                            discussion of other matters prior to making further proposals re
                            municipalities, and had said he would explain Turkish Cypriot attitude
                            to Greek Cypriot Ministers.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KF1">Kutchuk</persName> said they hoped that we
                            also would support Turkish Cypriot views. I said that we had all along
                            counseled moderation and restraint on both sides in reconciling
                            differences of opinion and that it would seem still to be possible to
                            find some compromise for municipalities within framework of
                            Constitution.</p>
                        <p>It also seemed to me that as several years had elapsed since drafting of
                            Constitution, their subsequent experience might make possible practical
                            changes without undermining the whole. We in US, for example, had found
                            it necessary to make ten amendments to our Constitution not long after
                            its adoption. I was not suggesting that they give up important rights,
                            but that there might be adjustments which would be acceptable for good
                            of all. I was glad to hear they stood ready to resume talks with Greek
                            Cypriots, and expressed belief that, with <persName corresp="#p_CG1"
                                >Clerides</persName>’ assistance, they would be able to find some

                            for agreement, as we lack leverage and it might provide excuse for
                            further delay in resolution of problem. Reasonable basis for agreement,
                            after necessary modifications, appears presently available in <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName>’ proposals of last March as
                            subsequently modified, which offer prospect of guarantees which should
                            accord Turkish community substance, if not form, of what they desire. I
                            doubt <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> will now accept
                            lengthy continuance separate Turkish municipal councils, even with
                            addition of joint municipal boards.</p>
                        <p>Key will be whether <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> allows Turkish
                            Cypriots sufficient negotiating flexibility. This connection, I believe
                            it important that all three guarantor powers, especially Athens and
                            Ankara, who know best how to influence their communities here, should
                            through continuing close consultation coordinate their efforts in Cyprus
                            to encourage agreement on reasonable compromise solution.</p>

                        <p>4387. Cyprus municipalities dispute has reached a point where we feel we
                            must supplement our present policy of counseling moderation with more
                            positive action. We fully agree that any direct US approach to the
                            factions in Cyprus would be counterproductive and would saddle us with
                            problem for indefinite future. On other hand, <gloss target="#t_UK1"

                            parties concerned. In past few days British have demonstrated
                            willingness to involve themselves more <pb n="549" xml:id="pg_549"

                            approach is too piecemeal and is not having desired effect. We note that

                                        during Zurich Accord as preliminary to tripartite meeting.
                                        Averoff told <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Ambassador
                                        Athens he knew of no such “gentleman’s agreement” and never

                                        degenerate because of existing tensions between two

                            decision of Constitutional Court was not favorable to Greek point of

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> said he was at loss
                            understand how such things could be said in light of existing formal
                            agreements. With reference to municipalities Turks had made specific
                            proposal which would have end result of accomplishing what <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> seeking. Turks know this and
                            made proposal deliberately with that knowledge in mind but what they
                            must insist on is that procedure be such that existing and solemn
                            agreements not be violated. To do otherwise would be enact “first act of
                            long tragedy”. That Turk apprehension in this regard well founded, said
                                <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName>, was substantiated by
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName>’ own reference in

                            other than Greek conscience, which seemed be just another way of saying
                            that Enosis remains objective. Was <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Makarios</persName> deliberately trying drive problem to point of
                            desperation which could lead to use of force? It seemed fantastic. But
                            what are Turks to think?</p>
                        <p>Then, speaking very seriously but unemotionally, <persName
                                corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> said he was at complete loss know
                            what to do in this situation and felt only recourse was to turn to us
                            for advice and assistance. All he was asking was that agreements be
                            respected. He couldn’t believe that was asking too much since it is
                            merely recognition of basic principle of international
                            relationships.</p>
                        <p>I replied would report to my government with view eliciting any thoughts
                            which might be helpful. But in meantime I would observe that we had, of
                            course, been following matter attentively with view encouraging parties
                            reach agreed solution and we had felt at one time recently that some
                            progress being made toward narrowing issue re municipalities. In

                            had made situation even more difficult than before. However, I had word
                            of counsel, which was that, if <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> felt
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> statements
                            excessive, thing to avoid would be to reply in kind. To do so would
                            merely escalate problem to greater degree of difficulty and <pb n="554"
                                xml:id="pg_554" facs="0576"/>would also not reflect favorably on
                            position of reasonableness which <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            asserts be its purpose. There is sometimes temptation in such
                            circumstances to resort to tit-for-tat tactics but to do so usually
                            self-defeating.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> expressed agreement, saying
                            he was conscious of desirability of maintaining dignified posture but
                            added this difficult, noting bitter anti-Turk campaign now being carried
                            on in Greek press as contrasted calm being preserved here. In this
                            connection, he said there had been plan for visit of Greek journalists
                            to Turkey last fall which had been postponed till March 28 only to have
                            it cancelled at last minute on ground Greeks did not feel it appropriate
                            come to Turkey at time when their press so aroused. “What”, asked
                                <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName>, “can we do in such a
                            situation?” I then asked <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> if
                            there had been any developments toward discussion of these problems with
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_EF1"
                                >Erkin</persName> said that there had not and that his proposal to
                            meet Averoff was still without reply. As contrasted pondered nature rest
                            of conversation, this was said with distinct bitterness.</p>
                        <p>I then noted that proper communication would seem be part of problem
                            since, for instance, we had report from our Embassy Athens that Averoff
                            had publicly expressed appreciation for release Greek fishermen in

                            <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> said this interesting news

                            which defies simplified solution, it would appear that there is one
                            factor in it which can be segregated as being constantly and needlessly
                            noxious. This is tendency of <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Makarios</persName> personally to take positions and make
                            statements which not only exacerbate situation here by confirming worst
                            suspicions of Turks but also seem to be in clear conflict with policy of
                            moderation which <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> reportedly
                            endeavoring exert. If this correct, would seem that this particular
                            problem is of type which might be approached as thing in itself. Problem
                            is who is going to bell the cat.</p>

                            intervention rights of Guarantor Powers. We assume that his recent

                            designed to carry out this ultimate objective while maintaining his
                            position and strength on island.</p>

                            move toward objective whenever he feels attitudes of interested powers
                            will let him get by with it. In this frame of mind, he may interpret US
                            and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> counsels of restraint and
                            moderation as evidence of reluctance to reopen issues, become further
                            involved, or see problem escalate. Furthermore, he cannot fail be aware
                            of US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> concern over current
                            tensions between <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies Greece and

                            and Ankara, and in final analysis rely on <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> and US keep <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> off his

                        <p>He also appears confident he can always refer issue to UN and receive
                            wide support uncommitted and neutralist nations in his struggle against
                            outside (i.e., Turkish) intervention (Nicosia’s 447). In our judgment,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName>’ ability to
                            utilize UN instrumentalities and to mobilize support in UN would be
                            decisively influenced by circumstances in which possible Turkish
                            intervention might arise. In general, without making any final judgment
                            re merits of case, we feel there would probably be a good deal of
                            sympathy and support for <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Makarios</persName> in UN where members would have reserved

                            Treaty of Guarantee. <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName>
                            may believe, therefore, that referral to UN, or (more probably) threat

                                and Averoff on the range of Greek foreign policy problems. During

                                to induce <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> to

                        <p>2. I have been informed by reliable source that letter, which appeared to
                            have been three or four pages in length, was friendly but firm. General
                            line reported to be somewhat as follows:</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> is prepared to continue to help
                            Cyprus to reach reasonable solution, as in past, but if <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> should seek to force
                            revision of Constitution, Greece and Cyprus must then go separate ways.
                            Greece has always honored its signature and will continue to do so. It
                            can never subscribe to doctrine of unilateral revision of international
                            agreements. Grave dangers lie in such a course. Much emphasis is placed
                            on bearing of Cyprus problem on Turkish-Greek relations, and importance
                            preventing further deterioration those relations. It is said that
                            unilateral action could lead not only to aggravation tension in
                            Greek-Turkish relations, but also to deterioration position of
                            Patriarch. Letter warns that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> is so
                            strongly committed to avoidance extra-legal action that, if necessary,
                            government is prepared go before public with statement upholding
                            London–Zurich agreements.</p>
                        <p>Letter acknowledges government realization such a public stance will pose
                            most serious internal problem in Greece, but states that if pushed to
                            extremes, it is prepared to submit question to people either through new
                            elections or plebiscite.</p>
                        <p>4. Averoff believes his letter has made deep impression on <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> who “turned white” when he
                            read it. It is Averoff’s opinion that <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Makarios</persName> had every reason to believe Greeks are not
                            speaking idly and that <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName>
                            will realize <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> is deadly serious.</p>
                        <p>5. Averoff feels strongly that, following action of Constitutional Court,
                            time is ripe to exert further pressure on <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Makarios</persName> “to work something out.” He therefore urges
                            that US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> make immediate demarche to
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName>. Averoff does not
                            want to approach British personally and he prefers we not quote him to
                            British. He considers time of <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0581"
                            />the essence if <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> is to
                            be steered into sensible course. He hopes we will act this week end and,
                            if possible, persuade the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to do
                            likewise.</p>
                        <p>6. I reminded Averoff that we had been counselling moderation for a long
                            time. He expressed his appreciation this fact but replied that it was
                            most important at this moment, following the Court action, to press
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> again.</p>
                        <p>7. I shall appreciate receiving Department’s reaction ASAP as I shall be
                            seeing Averoff again shortly.</p>

                            acceptable, best solution might be to request House temporarily to give

                            Cypriots continued to meet and discuss matters. I added that as I had

                            that it was heartening to observe economic progress which Cyprus was
                            making and expressed hope similar political progress would soon be

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> said that, as matter of
                            fact, he had been preoccupied with other questions and there had been no
                            new political developments in past few days. He himself had not

                            reached conclusion in his own mind that it would be necessary to revise
                            Cypriot Constitution. He had, however, not as yet decided what timing
                            and procedure would be for revision. Many articles of Constitution were
                            unamendable; consequently careful consideration would be required as to
                            when and how revision should be handled.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> also observed that
                            there were varying interpretations with respect to Treaty of Guarantee.
                            Some thought it meant guarantor <pb n="565" xml:id="pg_565" facs="0587"

                            interpretation. He did not think Cyprus could be described as
                            independent country if other countries had right of intervention and had
                            their troops stationed in Cyprus as Greece and Turkey did. British bases
                            in Cyprus were different matter as they were subject of separate
                            bilateral agreements. <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName>

                            said that following my last conversation with him I had seen several
                            Turkish Cypriot leaders and had urged them to continue earlier

                            There no longer seemed any real possibility of solution through direct
                            talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. Although he had reached this
                            conclusion, he had not as yet decided when to go about it or how to
                            proceed. Cypriot Constitution would not, in any event, be subject which
                            could be considered by UN, although other matters, such as Treaty of
                            Guarantee, might be. He hoped by next week to summarize on paper his
                            thoughts regarding present and future of Cyprus and would give us

                        <p>At time when agreements establishing Cyprus State were signed in London
                            in February, 1959, it was more than obvious that number of provisions of
                            those agreements would create difficulties in functioning of state,
                            constituting at same time sources of friction between Greeks and Turks
                            in Cyprus, with grave consequences affecting relations between Greece
                            and Turkey.</p>
                        <p>In course of conference in London—at which <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss>, Greece and Turkey participated—<persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Archbishop Makarios</persName> had then
                            expressed serious reservations with regard to certain provisions
                            contained in agreements and, in fact, proposed some amendments, which
                            were not, however, accepted. In his desire to see end to bloodshed, on
                            one hand, and on other hand to see Cyprus attaining independence, he had
                            finally decided to sign agreements, upon which Constitution of Cyprus
                            was subsequently based.</p>
                        <p>Since independence, it has become abundantly clear that certain
                            constitutional provisions are unworkable in actual practice, as for
                            example provision with regard to separate municipalities in five main
                            towns of island. Other provisions, one, for example, requiring separate
                            majorities for enactment of taxation legislation, create many obstacles
                            in smooth running of state and seriously hinder government’s efforts to
                            apply sound policy of economic development.</p>
                        <p>It might, perhaps, be argued that constitutional provisions in question
                            have been devised in such manner as to provide certain safeguards to
                            Turkish minority. It should not, however, be difficult to find other
                            ways and means of safeguarding interests of minority, without
                            necessarily hindering efforts for progress of people of Cyprus as whole,
                            and without creating permanent sources of friction between Greeks and
                            Turks.</p>
                        <p>Anomalous state of affairs, created as result of various internal
                            difficulties arising from Constitution, is made even worse by so-called
                                <pb n="567" xml:id="pg_567" facs="0589"/>Treaty of Guarantee and
                            Treaty of Alliance. Mere existence on paper of those treaties is in
                            itself source of danger, although no one could successfully argue that
                            those two treaties might serve any useful purpose at all. Furthermore,
                            these treaty arrangements are in direct conflict with very essence of
                            true independence. Any attempt by any one or other three countries to
                            intervene would unavoidably lead to very serious situation in Cyprus,
                            with great possibility of wider conflict between Greece and Turkey.</p>
                        <p>Any interference by other countries in internal affairs of Cyprus must be
                            considered as completely unacceptable. Argument might be advanced that
                            Turkey is interested in fate of Cyprus for military reasons of its own,
                            due to geographic proximity between two countries. In view of Greek
                            Cypriot leadership, Turkey’s concern, whether genuine and legitimate or
                            not, might be met by other and perhaps more effective arrangements.</p>
                        <p>There is no doubt that certain provisions of Constitution of Cyprus
                            should be revised. Question which arises is what procedure should be
                            followed in order to meet situation.</p>
                        <p>Greek Cypriot leadership have come to conclusion to raise officially
                            question of revising Constitution, and for this purpose they will
                            approach others concerned. It would have been very good thing indeed if
                            all interested parties would acquiesce such revision. But if, on other
                            hand, it were to prove impossible to have consent of others, then Greek
                            Cypriot leadership will proceed with revision of Constitution, employing
                            internationally accepted democratic methods and procedures. In such
                            case, it is contemplated that people would be called upon to elect
                            special representatives to Constitutional Assembly, which would be
                            entrusted with task of effecting necessary amendments to Constitution of
                            the state.</p>
                        <p>Before, however, final decision is taken on procedure to be followed,
                            opinion of highly qualified constitutional experts will be sought.</p>
                        <p>Whatever line that may have to be pursued, one of main objectives should
                            be not to allow Cyprus to continue to be bone of contention between
                            Greece and Turkey with unavoidable repercussions within and outside
                            island.</p>

                        <p>276. 1. In talk with Prime Minister Pipinelis today, he said that,
                            although some may think Cyprus situation is relatively quiet, he
                            considers it most serious. In his view, there could be an explosion at
                            any time. Accordingly, he had sent message to <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> to effect that Greek Govt
                            understood the problems facing Govt of Cyprus and realized that it would
                            be necessary at some time to have some constitutional amendments. The
                            message stated, however, that Greece would not recognize “coup” or
                            unilateral action by Cyprus and that any constitutional changes must be
                            done through agreement of all interested parties. (I asked Pipinelis
                            whether his govt was prepared for a meeting of the guarantor powers. He
                            replied that he could not say definitely but that he personally thought
                            it was the only sensible way.)</p>
                        <p>2. According to Pipinelis, <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Makarios</persName> replied to his message saying that the
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> statement about
                            constitutional changes had been “misinterpreted”; all <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> was doing was to appoint
                            committee to study legal problems, etc. and that he had no intention of
                            any “coup” or unilateral action “at least before next year.” Pipinelis
                            added that, in view of the explosive nature of the Cypriot problem, it
                            was well for the other parties in interest not to assume that the
                            situation was quiescent and that they could safely wait “until next
                            year.”</p>
                        <p>(Pipinelis made it clear that he was not asking US to do anything but
                            merely wanted to inform me of his personal views.)</p>
                        <p>3. Pipinelis then discussed matter of Greek-Turkish relations and said he
                            believed that, through quiet step-by-step actions, much could be done to
                            improve those relations. He mentioned that he had been able to work out
                            with <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> an exchange of letters
                            (“long held up because of a foolish failure to agree on wording”) which
                            enabled work in the Evros River region to go forward. He said that the
                            most difficult outstanding case (other than Cyprus) had to do with the
                            proposed Turkish territorial waters legislation. Here again he stated
                            that he felt progress had been made. Two days ago he had sent to Ankara
                            a proposal for a joint consortium relating to the fishing rights in the
                            waters between the Greek islands and the Turkish coast. In his
                            discussion with <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> some time
                            ago at the airport here, <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> had
                            indicated that he considered joint consortium as a desirable approach.
                            According to Pipinelis, <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> has
                            also <pb n="572" xml:id="pg_572" facs="0594"/>agreed to put a provision
                            in the territorial waters legislation postponing six-mile extension of
                            fishing rights for two years. “This would leave plenty of time for
                            Greece and Turkey to work out their mutual problems.”</p>
                        <p>4. Pipinelis said that through arrangements such as these he hoped it
                            would be possible to establish a new atmosphere of confidence which
                            would tend to make the solution of the crucial Cyprus problem
                            easier.</p>
                        <p>5. Pipinelis’ optimism re Greek-Turkish relations was reflected several
                            days ago by Turkish charge in call on DCM. charge spoke in similar vein
                            of progress being made on problems raised by territorial waters
                            legislation (which he predicted would be passed in about two months’
                            time) and commented that Cyprus remains the only problem between Greece
                            and Turkey capable of engendering serious difficulties.</p>

                            number of statements touching on difficulties flowing from Constitution
                            and treaties indicating need for change. Press has seized upon these
                            statements for wide speculation.</p>
                        <p>This morning I found <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName>
                            relaxed and confident that Greek and Turkish Cypriots would eventually
                            be able solve their current problems. He was doubtful, however, if
                            Turkish Cypriots or Ankara would be willing to make any arrangement
                            right now. For this reason <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Makarios</persName> thought he might be forced to take unilateral
                            action, but believed Turkish Cypriots would in end see merit in his
                            suggestions for changes and accept them.</p>
                        <p>I commented that I thought he was on wrong track in handling matter in
                            this way, adding that it would seem wiser quietly to make some <pb
                                n="573" xml:id="pg_573" facs="0595"/>arrangement behind scenes with
                            Turkish Cypriots and with Ankara. I also said that it seemed to me
                            recent statements to press made it more difficult to make such
                            arrangement as they hardened attitudes. I recalled our support for
                            continuing validity of Constitution and treaties, as stated last April
                            and subsequently (<gloss target="#t_DEPTEL1">Deptel</gloss> 74),<note

                            parties.</p>
                        <p>I also said that on my way back to Cyprus I had stopped off briefly in
                            London, Athens and Ankara and had heard many observers in each capital
                            express belief that Greek and Turkish Cypriots would yet find solution
                            among themselves.<note n="2" xml:id="d288fn2"><persName corresp="#p_WF1"
                                    >Wilkins</persName>’ talks were reported in telegram 655 from
                                London, August 8 (Department of State, Central Files, POL 27 Cyp),
                                telegram 245 from Athens, August 12 (ibid., POL Cyp), and telegram
                                198 from Ankara, August 14 (ibid.).</note> I suggested to <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> that he have another talk
                            with <persName corresp="#p_KF1">Kutchuk</persName> and also arrange
                            conversations with Turkish officials in Ankara.</p>
                        <p>I strongly urged that such talks be held without publicity. Possibility
                            of success would thus be increased. <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Makarios</persName> was dubious if Turks were now in mind to talk,
                            but said that he would discuss matter with <persName corresp="#p_CG1"
                                >Clerides</persName> who was returning in few days and would find
                            some way of probing situation with <persName corresp="#p_KF1"
                                >Kutchuk</persName> and with Turkish officials in Ankara.</p>
                        <p>I strongly urged <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> to
                            make sincere effort along these lines. I believe I made some headway
                            this morning in persuading him to make another quiet effort with Turkish
                            Cypriots and with Ankara, but <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Makarios</persName> is firm believer in using press for purpose of
                            negotiation; consequently it remains to be seen how far he will go in
                            seeking quiet talks with Turkish Cypriots and with Ankara.</p>

                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> opened the
                            conversation by describing a talk he had arranged the day before with
                            Cypriot Permanent Representative <persName corresp="#p_RZ1"
                                >Rossides</persName>, at <persName corresp="#p_RZ1"
                                >Rossides</persName>’ request. <persName corresp="#p_RZ1"
                                >Rossides</persName> attempted to assure <persName corresp="#p_EF1"
                                >Erkin</persName> that the current actions of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> did not mean that the
                            constitutional guarantees of the Turkish Cypriots were in question.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> told <persName
                                corresp="#p_RZ1">Rossides</persName> that Turkey had signed the
                            London–Zurich agreements in the firm belief that they would be
                            thoroughly and solemnly implemented. Turkey considered the London–Zurich
                            agreement to be a sui generis document, recognizing the existence of two
                            communities on Cyprus, and believing it to be a good and feasible
                            instrument for the attainment of the welfare and happiness of all the
                            people of Cyprus. Turkey had found, unfortunately, that this spirit was
                            not shared by “others”, who appear determined to destroy the agreement
                            and reduce the Turks to the status of an ordinary minority left helpless
                            under the Greek majority.</p>
                        <p>A symbol of this conflict, said the Foreign Minister, is the
                            municipalities question. It is not a question of perpetual partition of
                            the municipalities, but rather a question of good will and mutual
                            confidence. Turkey feels that the sooner the Greek Cypriot leaders are
                            able to create the necessary degree of inter-communal confidence, the
                            sooner the partition of municipalities can be ended, at which point no
                            one could be <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0597"/>happier than
                            Turkey. Unfortunately, the Greek Cypriot leaders, rather than acting to
                            create confidence, had abruptly served a three-months ultimatum to the
                            Turkish community on the municipalities question. Greek Cypriot leaders
                            have apparently forgotten the principles of London–Zurich, and are
                            openly talking of a unilateral revision of the Constitution, and of
                            Enosis.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister noted that he had at several times been forced to
                            act publicly and privately to keep the Turkish minority in Cyprus from
                            exacerbating the situation. The Government of Greece appears to share
                            Turkey’s basic outlook and has several times attempted with little
                            success to warn Greek Cypriot leaders of the probable consequences of
                            their folly.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if the Greek Government had done this publicly; the
                            Foreign Minister replied in the affirmative. The Foreign Minister went
                            on to say that Turkey had addressed remonstrances to the Cypriot Foreign
                            Minister, but he had replied that communal problems were a matter of
                            domestic concern to Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked how serious is Greek Cypriot talk of Enosis. The
                            Foreign Minister replied that it is difficult to say, and that much of
                            it may be only lip service to an outworn idea. However, the Foreign
                            Minister continued, the creation of a Republic of Cyprus based on a
                            simple political majority would in a mystic way represent Enosis to many
                            Greek Cypriots, since Enosis has facets other than simple political
                            union.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if the Constitution provided for amendments and if it
                            was an integral part of the London–Zurich accords. The Foreign Minister
                            said it had no provision for amendment and that it was an integral part
                            of the London–Zurich agreements.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked for <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName>’s
                            comments as to the time factor involved, noting that the Greek Cypriot
                            leaders are threatening to take further steps soon. The Foreign Minister
                            replied that he was not certain, but quoted <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> to the effect that the
                            Cyprus Revolution is a continuing process and that its objectives will
                            soon be attained.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked about the British attitude, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> replied that the British had made
                            repeated representations to <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Makarios</persName> in favor of the existing relations between the
                            communities and warning against unilateral changes.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted, and the Foreign Minister agreed, that the Greek
                            Government had been a moderating influence.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked who had any real influence over <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName>, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> said that while House Speaker
                                <persName corresp="#p_CG1">Clerides</persName> was the only other
                            really important figure in the Greek Cypriot community, it was apparent
                            that no individual possessed any real influence over <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName>.</p>
                        <pb n="576" xml:id="pg_576" facs="0598"/>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Makarios</persName> had not been completely frank with U.S.
                            officials during his American visit. <persName corresp="#p_EF1"
                                >Erkin</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Makarios</persName> had been described to him by a leading Greek
                            statesman only two weeks ago as an example of the worst type of
                            politician. During <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName>’
                            visit to Turkey in November he had made a flat promise that on his
                            return he would speak at length with Turkish Cypriot leaders, and had
                            broken his promise without even an apology. He has no intention of
                            creating a spirit of confidence in Cyprus, and rather wishes to create
                            confusion, on which he thrives.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> suggested that U.S. aid to
                            Cyprus might be withheld to pressure <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Makarios</persName> into adopting a more sensible communal
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied, and <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName>
                            appeared to agree, that such action, even if otherwise deemed desirable,
                            would allow <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> to turn to
                            the Bloc and thumb his nose at the U.S. and the West.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> went on to say that he had
                            never mentioned partition of the island as a solution, since he realized
                            the hardships and difficulties which would be involved. However, if
                            compelled by circumstances, Turkey would have to fall back on partition
                            as the only way to save the Turkish minority.</p>
                        <p>Replying to a question by the Secretary, <persName corresp="#p_EF1"
                                >Erkin</persName> said that partition would require mass movement of
                            population. He added that Turkey didn’t want partition, and that he was
                            not proposing it; Turkey wanted a continuation of the existing
                            Constitution of Cyprus.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> recalled that <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> had accused the Turkish
                            Cypriot leadership of misusing its prerogatives. Turkish leaders had
                            assured him that they wanted to make Cyprus survive as a bicommunal
                            state, and that they would be happy to exert influence on Turkish
                            Cypriots who misused their prerogatives, if <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> would provide details.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked what the effect of joint representation by the three
                            guarantor powers would be.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister replied that this would be a grave step which is not
                            justified by events so far. The British Government, which advises
                            calmness and continued negotiations, might not be willing to go so far,
                            and any Greek Government which participated would face extremely serious
                            domestic problems.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary promised to talk with Lord <persName corresp="#p_HAFD1"
                                >Home</persName> about Cyprus and to look into the Cyprus problem
                            with particular reference to U.S. policies and plans.</p>

                            replied firmly that, while certain modifications might be made in due
                            course, Turkey could not possibly agree to modifications of those
                            constitutional articles which London–Zurich agreements excluded from
                            amendment process. (At lunch afterwards, Secy General Bayramoglu said it

                            of constitutional changes but that talks between two communities on

                            constitutional changes were not involved.)</p>

                            approved proposals for United States action in Cyprus. The action
                            proposed was primarily along economic lines in an effort to lessen
                            communal tensions and enhance the chances for a settlement of
                            Greek-Turkish-Cypriot differences through cooperation in Cyprus’
                            economic development. As a result of the measures taken by the United
                            States, the United Kingdom, various European contributors, as well as
                            the Cypriots, the economy has strengthened.</p>
                        <p>However, the relations between the Greek and Turkish communities have

                            designed to avert a breakdown of order on Cyprus and the consequent
                            strain on relations between Greece and Turkey, to stabilize the Cyprus
                            Government as a deterrent against increased Communist influence, and to
                            ensure favorable conditions for the maintenance of our important

                            small army or none at all, 4) civil service employment on more rational
                            basis, 5) elimination of Vice President’s veto powers, 6) consolidation
                            of judicial system, and possibly 7) elimination of communal chambers.

                                >Makarios</persName> said he planned to send memorandum to each of

                            to hand us copy of memorandum and thought it would be ready to be sent

                            hoped that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KF1">Kutchuk</persName> would study

                            powers, as well as we, would be willing to speak with Ankara whose ties

                        <p>I commented that, as <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Archbishop

                            Cypriot proposals which would resolve present difficulties. I suggested
                            that they not be put forward as amendments, but as suggestions for
                            improving functioning of Constitution. I added we understood <gloss

                            amendments or improvements in Constitution were required and that if
                            Turkish Cypriots, with backing of Ankara, refused, it would be necessary

                            alone with him and not to discuss it with other Turk Cypriots.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KS1">Kyprianou</persName> also said <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> had tried to persuade
                                <persName corresp="#p_KF1">Kutchuk</persName> changes in Cypriot
                            Constitution were required and there was no real reason to delay.
                            Possibility of change of basic laws was acceptable in most countries.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> had also made
                            point, in effort to persuade Turk Cypriots to move toward change, that
                            it was much more difficult for him politically to recommend changes than
                            for Turk Cypriots. Reason was <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Makarios</persName> would be trying to improve Constitution and
                            thus committed to its support. Attitude reflected by these moves would
                            not be appreciated by Greek Cypriots who favored union with Greece.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KS1">Kyprianou</persName> said copies of memorandum
                            were being handed to reps of guarantor powers for information this
                            morning. No request for four-power meeting was being made as Cyprus
                            considered matter internal question but British planned to urge
                            favorable consideration upon Turkey. It was hoped that other guarantor
                            powers would lend such support to proposals as they saw fit. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KS1">Kyprianou</persName> added that Turk Amb’s reaction
                            had been favorable when he had received and run through memorandum this
                            morning.</p>
                        <p>I expressed hope that <persName corresp="#p_KS1">Kyprianou</persName>
                            memorandum was not at this stage being made available to press and steps
                            would be taken to prevent leaks. <persName corresp="#p_KS1"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> said it was being very closely held although
                            correspondents were aware of meetings which <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> and he had this morning and
                            were pressing for information.</p>
                        <p>I also asked <persName corresp="#p_KS1">Kyprianou</persName> if Greek
                            Cypriots were making any efforts to explain their points of view to Turk
                            Cypriots in addition to more formal <pb n="587" xml:id="pg_587"

                                >Kutchuk</persName> this morning. <persName corresp="#p_KS1"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> said he could see considerable merit in this
                            suggestion and would get in touch with Muftizahde whom he knew well and
                            spell out Greek Cypriot rationale for change.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KS1">Kyprianou</persName> also said he would now
                            leave for Paris on December 8 for various annual international meetings.
                            There were no plans to discuss Greek Cypriot memorandum at these
                            meetings but <persName corresp="#p_KS1">Kyprianou</persName> anticipated
                            informal talks might take place. <persName corresp="#p_KS1"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> planned to stop off in Athens for few days
                            enroute as he had not yet had chance to meet <persName corresp="#p_PG1"
                                >Papandreou</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_VS1"
                                >Venizelos</persName> since formation of new Greek Cabinet. He had
                            no plan to discuss memorandum with them but assumed it will arise during
                            talks.</p>
                        <p>Highlights of text of memorandum are being sent by separate telegram.
                            Argumentation, which is rather lengthy, will follow by pouch December 2.
                            Our own comment and any local reaction will be sent early next
                                week.<note n="1" xml:id="d297fn1">The Embassy in Nicosia transmitted

                                (Ibid.)</note> Our preliminary reaction is that memorandum is
                            well-reasoned legal document with some minor advantages for Turk

                            definitively and publicly at this time. In fact, he was in process

                        <p>I observed this news very disappointing because, irrespective of nature

                        <p>Unclear at this point as to position in which this reversal leaves

                            cut from under him on issue on which he had not only made decision but
                            committed himself to both British and ourselves.</p>
                        <p>Also interesting note that strong personal feeling of <persName

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Menemencioglu</persName> came in on
                            instructions from Ankara to discuss <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            views on the current situation in Cyprus. He opened the <pb n="589"
                                xml:id="pg_589" facs="0611"/>conversation by tracing recent events
                            revolving around the proposals made by <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Archbishop Makarios</persName> to Vice President Kuchuk. He tied
                            this to the Cypriot crisis of the 1950’s which he explained in terms of
                            Greek and Turkish public opinion developing extreme opinions and
                            dragging their respective Governments into similar positions. The <gloss
                                target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> wants to avoid a repetition of this
                            now.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said his Government had known that <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> was about to present some
                            thoughts, but had no idea they would go as far as these proposals. The
                            proposals skip over incidentals and go to the heart of life-and-death
                            issues involving Turk-Cypriots. First among these is the veto power.
                            This is particularly important as a safeguard against communist strength
                            on Cyprus, a subject which President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                                >Kennedy</persName> had referred to in his conversation with Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> last June.<note

                            proposals made concerned the army and police. All of this had been put
                            forward purposely by the <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Archbishop</persName> at a time of Cabinet change in Turkey.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> failed to
                            understand that any Turkish Cabinet would have precisely the same
                            reaction as the <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Menemencioglu</persName> reviewed
                            the <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> visit to
                            Washington in June 1962. It was his impression that <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> had been disappointed by the
                            firm <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> statements to the effect that
                            present communal arrangements on Cyprus must remain unchanged. He
                            continued that of course the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would
                            be pleased to cooperate in making the implementation of present
                            arrangements easier, but neither the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            nor Turk-Cypriots could consider changes in the arrangements themselves.
                            He hoped the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> could urge moderation
                            on the <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Archbishop</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJ1">Jernegan</persName> replied that the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had, in fact, been urging
                            moderation on all parties concerned in the present dispute. We too had
                            been surprised at the sweep of the <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Makarios</persName> proposals, but we do not share the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> view on the impossibility of studying
                            and replying to the proposals. We have been slightly hopeful over
                            reports that Kuchuk will take some time before making a reply. We very
                            much regret the quick public reply from the <gloss target="#t_GOT1"
                                >GOT</gloss>. At the very least, the <gloss target="#t_GOT1"
                                >GOT</gloss> could have refrained from making any comment.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> had no choice
                            but to reply. For one reason, there are no real Cypriots, only
                            Greek-Cypriots and Turk-Cypriots, and the Turkish Government must, as
                            certainly the Greek Government would also do, speak up for its fellow
                            nationals. Once Greek Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_VS1"
                                >Venizelos</persName> commented saying the proposals were entirely
                                <pb n="590" xml:id="pg_590" facs="0612"/>an internal Cypriot affair,
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> had no choice but to give its
                            own views.</p>
                        <p>In reply to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJ1">Jernegan</persName>’s question
                            about possible points that might be discussed, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MT1">Menemencioglu</persName> replied that there is the
                            question of joint community arrangements. Above all things, however,
                            Turk-Cypriots could not accept the <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Makarios</persName> proposals as an agenda for any kind of
                            discussion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJ1">Jernegan</persName> then commented that it
                            would be best for all if Kuchuk would at least reply by listing points
                            that he would be willing to discuss. The Ambassador said that might be
                            possible. Then in reply to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJ1"
                                >Jernegan</persName>’s question, he said the only way to get the
                            Cyprus situation back to something resembling a balance was for
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> to accept the fact
                            that Cyprus is an exceptional place requiring exceptional governmental
                            arrangements. The heart of such arrangements is the present minority
                            guarantees, without which the situation would be most grave.</p>
                        <p>In further discussion of a reply to the <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Makarios</persName> proposals, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJ1"
                                >Jernegan</persName> commented that it would be a most serious error
                            if Kuchuk submits a flatly negative reply. Not only would this harm the
                            international image of the Turk-Cypriots, but it would also give
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> an excuse for more
                            extreme future steps. The Ambassador agreed with both of these points,
                            adding that perhaps Kuchuk might reply by listing issues that fall short
                            of the life-and-death category. He then repeated his request that the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> speak up with <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> on the need for
                            moderation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJ1">Jernegan</persName> concluded the
                            conversation promising that we would continue to do all that is possible
                            to urge moderation on all parties. This would be done within the
                            limitations placed on us by the fact that prime responsibility rests
                            with the guarantor powers. This particularly refers to the United
                            Kingdom, whose present efforts toward a solution of the Cyprus problem
                            we are prepared to support.</p>

                            constitutional changes not to deprive Turkish minority of its rights but
                            to remove division of Greek and Turkish communities. <persName

                            but <gloss target="#t_FONMIN1">FonMin</gloss> expected constitutional
                            proposals also to be discussed. Turkish Government rejection is not a

                            alternatives indicated: 1) union with Greece or 2) independence within
                            British Commonwealth cutting alliance with Greece and Turkey. He said
                            Greek and Turkish alliances were merely sources of friction. Troops
                            maintained in Cyprus cannot defend the country and can only turn
                            possible internal conflicts into broader ones. Greek and Turkish forces
                            should leave and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> remain.</p>
                        <p>Secretary asked if this could be worked out between the two communities
                            in Cyprus. <gloss target="#t_FONMIN1">FonMin</gloss> replied only
                            problem is Turkish Government. Greeks will agree and <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> is favorable. If Turkish Cypriots refuse
                            to negotiate dangerous situation will develop. Secretary pointed out if
                            changes made by agreement no one could object; if attempt made carry out
                            changes without agreement explosive situation would be created.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_FONMIN1">FonMin</gloss> said independence should be
                            real independence. People of Cyprus should decide for themselves. Greeks
                            make up 82 percent of population and matter should be decided by
                            “democratic means”. <gloss target="#t_FONMIN1">FonMin</gloss> went on at
                            some length on theme that proposed constitutional changes would remove
                            division in communities, in legislature and judiciary. Fact that
                            proposal moderate demonstrated by opposition of extremists who desire
                            union now with Greece. Although there is interest in union with Greece,
                                <gloss target="#t_FONMIN1">FonMin</gloss> maintained “Commonwealth
                            solution” best.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said US feels that the two communities should work out this
                            problem in the first place and then the guarantor powers. In response to
                                <gloss target="#t_FONMIN1">FonMin</gloss>’s request US intervene
                            with Turks to persuade communities to negotiate, Secretary said US does
                            not need this additional <pb n="592" xml:id="pg_592" facs="0614"
                            />problem. We hope moderation will prevail and a way be found to
                            continue negotiation. Violence should be avoided.</p>
                        <p>Secretary asked <gloss target="#t_FONMIN1">FonMin</gloss> to keep
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WF1">Wilkins</persName> informed. US
                            primary concern is that whatever comes out of this be worked out by
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_FONMIN1">FonMin</gloss> said “on personal basis” he
                            would like Secretary to give thought to “wider solution” for Cyprus.
                            Secretary was noncommittal. He said <gloss target="#t_FONMIN1"
                                >FonMin</gloss> would have no trouble with US with whatever was
                            worked out by negotiation and agreement.</p>

                        <p>341. This afternoon Acting British High Commissioner and I together had
                            separate talks with <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_KF1">Kutchuk</persName>. We each stressed deep
                            concern of our two govts re recent incidents. We made points suggested
                            by Washington and London<note n="1" xml:id="d301fn1">In telegram 247 to
                                Nicosia, December 21, the Department of State informed the Embassy
                                of the British desire for a joint representation to Greek and
                                Turkish Cypriot leaders with the aim of restraining both the police
                                and Turkish rioters in the aftermath of violent clashes between
                                members of the two communities that resulted in five deaths. The
                                Department of State instructed <persName corresp="#p_WF1"
                                    >Wilkins</persName> to coordinate his demarche with the British

                            followed with close attention because of threat to Cypriots and our own
                            countrymen alike. We especially hoped that <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Makarios</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KF1"
                                >Kutchuk</persName> would find immediate ways of calming
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>By chance we saw <persName corresp="#p_KF1">Kutchuk</persName> first and
                            found him extremely pessimistic. Both he and Muftizadhe described recent
                            developments as new steps in Greek Cypriot plan to alter Constitution
                            and treaties. <persName corresp="#p_KF1">Kutchuk</persName> said Greek
                            Cypriot police had for some time been harassing Turk Cypriots at night
                            and that Greek Cypriot Minister of Interior had been irresolute and
                            biased in his reporting to <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Makarios</persName> and in his handling of events. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KF1">Kutchuk</persName> said he had persuaded <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> to issue joint call for <pb
                                n="593" xml:id="pg_593" facs="0615"/>moderation and restraint and to
                            make joint visit to scene of one altercation. He had also suggested
                            quick setting-up of commission of inquiry which will be considered by
                            Ministerial Council tomorrow morning. <persName corresp="#p_KF1"
                                >Kutchuk</persName> said he would continue to urge moderation and
                            restraint but was uncertain how long he could control his people in face
                            of continual Greek Cypriot provocation.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> was serious and
                            objective stressing that facts re various incidents were incomplete,
                            contradictory and exaggerated and it seemed to him incidents were
                            isolated and unconnected although he admitted some of minor developments
                            might have been retaliatory.</p>
                        <p>Minister of Interior had been asked to ascertain facts soonest and to
                            instruct Greek Cypriot police to restrict themselves to outskirts of
                            Turk Cypriot areas and not to act in provocative way. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> said he had agreed with
                                <persName corresp="#p_KF1">Kutchuk</persName> on desirability of
                            joint Greek/Turk Cypriot police patrols and commission of inquiry. There
                            might be some legal question in way of establishment of commission but
                            he favored it and would urge it in Council tomorrow.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> hoped that measures
                            along foregoing lines would be helpful in bringing down tension and
                            restoring peace.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> also added that because
                            of high state of tension he would not now move forward as quickly with
                            his plans for constitutional change. I took this reference to mean that
                            he would slow up carrying out plan for changing Constitution which he
                            outlined by memo last June and to which he has alluded from time to time
                            in subsequent conversations. I said it seemed to us preferable to work
                            out solutions with Turk Cypriots through discussions and that it still
                            seemed to me that changes could be effected within framework of
                            Constitution. <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> doubted,
                            however, it would be possible to move forward in this way as
                            interpretations or understandings of constitutional provisions would
                            not, he believed, be sufficiently binding.</p>
                        <p>Renewed clashes broke out this evening as I finished drafting preceding
                            account of conversations with <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Makarios</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KF1"
                                >Kutchuk</persName>. These reports are fragmentary but seem to

                            community in danger of massacre by Greek Cypriot community (all this

                            reason for meeting with <gloss target="#t_FONMIN1">FonMin</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> was reported in reftel but
                            he also commented further re more long-range aspects of problem and
                            asked this be reported to Department as background.</p>
                        <p>In brief, he said that as actual violence has ebbed in Cyprus there is
                            developing a deep and grim anger in Turkey and a despair and
                            apprehension among Turkish Cypriots leading to inexorable conclusion
                            that reestablishment of necessary degree confidence among two
                            communities and return status quo ante impossible.</p>
                        <p>Turks now coming to conclusion that <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Makarios</persName> real purpose is to make life so unendurable for
                            Turks that they will be forced leave unless more effective arrangement
                            made to assure equitable status. (In this connection <persName
                                corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> noted report that Turk police in
                            Cyprus not being paid and that <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Makarios</persName> threatening retaliatory action against them.
                            This <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would not tolerate.)</p>
                        <p>Indicating his general agreement this line of thought <persName
                                corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> recalled that only way
                            Greek-Turkish enmity transformed to friendship in twenties had been by
                            extreme measure of transfer population. Now confronted by similar
                            situation and, if Greek-Turkish friendship not to be tragically lost,
                            will be necessary have recourse to “radical” solution. What form it
                            might take frankly not yet clear to him. Partition comes to mind but he
                            had counselled responsible Turkish journalists not to stress for fear
                            partition might become public fixation and prevent proper consideration
                            some other possibly preferable solution.</p>
                        <p>Resolution of this longer term problem, said <persName corresp="#p_EF1"
                                >Erkin</persName>, will be difficult and “explosive” and he
                            expressed hope we would keep open mind and avoid premature conclusions.
                            Only specific thing he could now say was that break down of confidence
                            so great that necessary continue tripartite responsibility for
                            maintaining security until new solution reached.</p>

                                        Our statement should not discuss merits of Cypriot complaint
                                        against Turkey or of background issues which brought on

                                        we should call particular attention to existence of

                                        observance of Treaty provisions. Treaty provides further
                                        that, should concerted action by three guaranteeing powers
                                        not be possible, “each of the three guaranteeing powers

                        <p>423. As cease-fire arrangements are progressively improved, there is more
                            and more speculation as to political future of Cyprus and attitude not
                            only of guarantor powers, but also US, USSR and UAR. I have <pb n="602"

                            tied up with Sandys in meetings at other moments, but I have been in

                        <p>It is commonly believed that Republic of Cyprus has been dealt deep wound
                            which it will be difficult, if not impossible, to heal. Some believed
                            after Christmas that <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName>’
                            political position within Greek Cypriot community had been weakened
                            because he agreed to cease-fire before Greek Cypriot forces had achieved
                            their objectives and because he agreed to ask <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> to come back and command tripartite group supervising
                            it. This view may still be heard, but has been partially replaced by
                            comment that present situation proves <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1"
                                >Makarios</persName> has been correct all along in calling for
                            changes in Constitution and treaties and is now more than ever justified
                            in moving ahead to revise them.</p>
                        <p>Recent statements by <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS1">Kyprianou</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KF1">Kutchuk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DR2"
                                >Denktash</persName> are cited in evidence that old order has been
                            severely damaged. Greek Cypriots’ remarks are interpreted as continuing
                            to call for amendment to Constitution and dropping of Greece and Turkey
                            from Treaties of Guarantee and of Alliance. Turkish Cypriot remarks are
                            read as calling for partition although we believe Turkish Cypriots might
                            settle for autonomy with more effective guarantees, such as larger
                            Turkish military contingent. Most observers do not see how these
                            divergent views can be reconciled. Political discussion, much less
                            meeting of minds, between Greek and Turkish Cypriots is presently
                            unlikely in view of prevailing tension accompanied by charge and
                            countercharge here and elsewhere. Many observers suggest that guarantor
                            powers should again take up this problem as they did in 1959. Others
                            suggest UN or US or combination of all of these.</p>
                        <p>In past US has been charged, without foundation, of favoring Turkey.
                            During recent violence this Greek Cypriot myth was again heard. More
                            recently, however, rumors from Athens that American Sixth Fleet was in
                            Aegean and would prevent Turkish invasion of Cyprus have appeared and
                            American name is again in better standing. In past few days, there have
                            been some press comments that Cyprus should seek assist-ance from USSR.
                            This may be Soviet or Communist “fishing in troubled waters” or it may
                            be prompted by <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> who is
                            prone to make use of press and if true may be designed to pressure
                            Turks. Greek Cypriot leadership has still not welcomed Greek Cypriot
                            Communists into fold. It did not, for example, arm them or make use of
                            them in recent fighting, although Communists must have pressed hard to
                            be included in hope of washing away stigma that they stood aside during
                            fight with British several years ago. UAR Amb has called on <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Makarios</persName> two or three times during
                            past few days. UAR may be trying to get back into <persName

                                >Makarios</persName> would listen because he still would like to
                            have Arab support at UN.</p>
                        <p>Cyprus’ political future on eve of new year is thus far from clear, but
                            with consolidation of cease-fire and gradual calming of passions, Greek
                            and Turkish Cypriots may think about this future more rationally. I
                            would hope that, instead of turning to radical solutions, such as
                            partition which might lead to movement of population, they would
                            maintain unity of Cyprus by moving toward some form of federation.
                            Turkish Cypriot call for partition might be countered with suggestion
                            that Turkish Cypriot community be allowed to manage its own affairs for
                            time being, with help whenever possible from central government, and
                            that this set-up continue until there is time for further discussion as
                            to political future of Cyprus. Separate municipalities, for example,
                            have been functioning in this way without geographic division of areas
                            since 1958.</p>

                                moreover, public knowledge (which inevitable in Greece) of such an
                                attempt could only lead to further acrimony.</item>

                                negotiations, i.e., that last minute demand for “most favored
                                debtor” treatment, coupled with simultaneous withdrawal of <gloss

                                was made with foreknowledge it would cause collapse of negotiations.
                                I believe it would be poor tactics for U.S. Govt. at this time to
                                view with favor Greek demand for “most favored debtor” treatment.
                                Not only would they continue delay settlement for domestic political
                                reasons, but it would be counter to Greek character if they did not
                                view such a gesture as one of “softness” which could later be
                                exploited through further endless rounds of negotiations like those
                                of the last two years. The time may come when it might be
                                advantageous for the U.S. bondholders to be in a position to offer
                                some concession in Greece’s direction, e.g. bondholders might be
                                willing withdraw their “standard clause” which probably not very
                                meaningful in case of Greece. However, any gestures on our part

                                agreement along the lines almost-agreed with U.S. bondholders last

                        <p>Following a discussion of the Greek 5-year program and related
                                problems,<note n="1" xml:id="d311fn1">A copy of the memorandum of
                                conversation on this subject is ibid.</note> Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said there was one further
                            question which he <pb n="606" xml:id="pg_606" facs="0628"/>wished to
                            raise. This had occasioned us and the Congress some concern. It was, of
                            course, the question of the pre-war bonds. We were very sympathetic
                            towards the Greek position, and did not wish to be rigid in our own. We
                            recognized that the issue caused the Prime Minister some political
                            problems, but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> felt that
                            he should say that it also occasioned political difficulties for us as
                            well. He hoped that there would be some way to give assurances to the
                            bondholders that the problem would be solved. At this point Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LA1">Liatis</persName> asked whether Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> meant assurances to the
                            bondholders: would such assurances be made public? This could be very
                            dangerous. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> responded
                            that there was no necessity that such assurances be made public. It
                            would suffice were they to be made to Mr.
                            <persName>Munro</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> then commented that,
                            since the question had been brought up, he would like to make it clear
                            that there was no question of the Greeks having refused to settle. Up to
                            1950, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> should understand,
                            Greece had experienced ten years of devastating war and emerged almost
                            totally prostrate, and now found themselves in the position of being
                            pushed to ask the Germans and Italians—the very nations which had
                            visited such devastation on Greece—for assistance.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then proceeded to explain the Greek position. In 1950
                            Greece had just emerged from the guerrilla war. There followed four
                            years of political and economic instability: only in the last five to
                            six years had the Greek Government been able to devote its energy to
                            bringing order to the situation. In other words, during the period when
                            European countries were able to use American assistance to rebuild their
                            economies, the Greeks were forced to spend all they received on the war
                            with the Communists; when it came their turn to rebuild, American
                            assistance, and specifically the Marshall Plan, was fading away.
                            Notwithstanding, since 1953 and 1954, they had taken four or five
                            initiatives to try to come to agreement. All the Greeks asked were
                            conditions which were politically acceptable. In a country which had
                            suffered such devastation in the common Western interest, this was
                            extremely difficult. No Greek had received a penny in indemnity for loss
                            or damage to his private property, or indeed for loss of life. It is not
                            easy first to settle foreign indebtedness, before investing in
                            development projects designed to raise the country from prostration.
                            There was no lack of will on the part of the Greek Government to do so.
                            We must, however, remember that not only had Greek lives and property
                            been destroyed without compensation during the war, but the entire
                            economy was shattered with all savings, bonds completely lost with no
                            prospect of reimbursement.</p>
                        <p>Against such a situation, any settlement must be very carefully presented
                            from the psychological point of view. Notwithstanding, two years ago the
                            Greeks made another effort. They had started out to offer $4 million per
                            year to service the bonds, and had ultimately agreed to $7 <pb n="607"
                                xml:id="pg_607" facs="0629"/>million; but then the bondholders had
                            interjected a proviso to the effect that they should receive the benefit
                            of any more favorable settlement reached with any other creditor by the
                            Greeks. The Prime Minister had, quite rightfully he believed, asked that
                            this cause be reciprocal. He had in mind the Communist countries, for
                            example Rumania. It would put his government in a completely untenable
                            position to have such countries receive more favorable treatment at the
                            hands of the United States. The Prime Minister made the point that he
                            was operating within a democracy, albeit a poor democracy. If the
                            Bulgarians or the Yugoslavs received more favorable treatment, he was
                            required to explain it. He noted, for example, the temporary settlement
                            reached between the bondholders and the Yugoslavs, asserting that they
                            had received better terms than those offered the Greeks. At this point
                            Mr. <persName>Averoff</persName> interjected the Yugoslav-French
                            agreement, where the Yugoslavs received “far better” treatment.
                            Virtually 95% of the Yugoslav capital indebtedness had been written off.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> continued that, to
                            the simple-minded Greek, it was impossible for him to explain why the
                            United States was treating non-allies, neutrals, and even enemy
                            countries such as Rumania, better than its ally, Greece. The political
                            side was of much greater importance to the Prime Minister than the
                            economic; he couldn’t care less if it cost him $1 million more or less
                            per year. The problem was how to present it. Greece might be poor, but
                            it was democratic and politically-minded.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LA1">Liatis</persName> then translated
                            very carefully: “the Prime Minister states that it is in his intention
                            to settle”, and “indeed he might have been able already to settle it if
                            you had not connected it with loans, <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss>
                            in this case. It would have been disastrous to the Greek Government, as
                            to any Greek government—to appear to settle under the pressure of a
                            threat of no loans unless there was a settlement. It would have been a
                            similar disaster to the United States, from the point of view of its
                            position in Greece.” The Prime Minister could not follow what he viewed
                            as a political mistake in Washington. The United States might be correct
                            from its point of view, but the Prime Minister was, so far as Greece was
                            concerned. In any event, the Greek Government “is determined to find at
                            a proper time a proper solution, without connection to aid from the
                            United States.” This was the duty of the Greek Government, and the Greek
                            Government would settle with or without United States aid to Greece.
                            This was one of the basic measures which the Greek Government must take
                            in order to re-establish Greece’s credit and good name. The Prime
                            Minister wished to stress that, when the time came in his view to
                            approach the bondholders, he would ask the United States to assist in
                            achieving this, through admonitions and suggestions to the
                            bondholders.</p>
                        <pb n="608" xml:id="pg_608" facs="0630"/>
                        <p>In response, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> stated that
                            he appreciated the Greek position and wanted to make it clear that we
                            did not wish to be categorical. At the same time, he should say to the
                            Prime Minister that the situation created for us some political
                            problems, not only to the extent that it might condition the amount of
                            help we can give Greece by Congressional control of funds, but also
                            because the Congress exercises great scrutiny over our policies and
                            programs thus limiting our own freedom of action. He did not put this
                            forward as a categoric condition, but rather to reveal that these are
                            political facts for us, as well as the Prime Minister. The Prime
                            Minister interjected at this point that he saw quite well that the
                            United States also had difficulties, and agreed entirely. The United
                            States difficulties, however, were different. His were more
                            fundamental.</p>
                        <p>After reverting momentarily to the prior discussion of the Greek 5-year
                            program, the Prime Minister concluded his presentation by pointing out
                            that when problems failed of resolution, occasionally it was because the
                            means to resolve them were not available. At other times, it was because
                            the problems were not understood. If now the problems between the United
                            States and Greece were not resolved, it would not be because he had
                            failed to do what he regarded his duty in endeavoring to explain them.
                            For his part, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> concluded
                            by extending assurances that the United States had every intention of
                            doing everything it could to help. The United States wished to see the
                            Greek economy grow as rapidly as possible, and the standard of living
                            raised for its people.</p>

                                <persName>Jones</persName> were called in about 10:20 to the
                            President who asked how the visit was going. He was told that the Greeks
                            are very pleased with the treatment they have received and that they
                            were particularly delighted the U.S. Government has relaxed its informal
                            ban on <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> lending arising out of the
                            unresolved Greek bond problem.</p>
                        <p>The President said he would like to know more about the Greek bonds: Who
                            owned them? were they the subject of speculation? It did not seem
                            reasonable to him to withhold needed aid to a country over old debts of
                            this kind. He asked Mr. <persName>Jones</persName> to submit to him a

                        <p>The President showed familiarity with his briefing book and glanced at

                                661–666.</note> The President said that he was opposed to the U.S.
                            moving in on the situation in Cuba at this time: we must keep in step
                            with other Latin American countries.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> said that everywhere
                            democracies are faced with the problem of Communism and this calls for
                            sacrifices to meet the challenge.</p>
                        <p>The President told <persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> that
                            he knew the latter wished to speak to President Truman and that he had
                            put through a long distance call to Independence, Missouri. He said he
                            had just received a letter from President Truman regretting his
                            inability to be present at the state luncheon given Monday for the Prime
                            Minister’s party. <persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> said
                                <pb n="610" xml:id="pg_610" facs="0632"/>he would be glad to speak
                            with President Truman, whose name has special significance for Greece.
                            Unfortunately, when President Truman was in Greece three years ago, the
                            Cyprus trouble was at its height and he was unable to receive Truman.
                            However, he would like to invite him to return to Greece.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> said that it was
                            essential to the success of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> that
                            equilibrium be preserved in the south of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. Greece for the past ten years had been endeavoring to
                            achieve this. However, the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies
                            displayed a remarkable lack of willingness to make <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> strong. Disagreements existed. There
                            was no disposition to make sacrifices in the interest of the whole as
                            Greece had done in connection with the Cyprus question. The <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members were too selfish.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> said that among the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies Greece was the only
                            country ready and willing to have a larger army. Geography might account
                            in part for this, but the fact remained that Greece was the poorest of
                            the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies and was always pressed
                            to find ways and means to make ends meet.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister thought the fifteen <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> countries should get together to discuss seriously
                            what needs to be done now and what in the future. He said that the U.S.
                            was the “natural leader” of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and,
                            if necessary, the U.S. should “compel” the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> partners to straighten out their differences.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what was needed to strengthen <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>: Which way should <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> move?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> replied that the first
                            requirement was a common policy against Communism; the second great need
                            was to establish consultation procedures which would be able to deal
                            with all problems. Averoff interjected “consultation with
                            discrimination”—said that not all problems between <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members were of general interest, in
                            which event there should be consultations only between the parties
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>The President said that there was a real problem in dealing with <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries where differences in policy
                            arose outside of Europe; for example, in the Congo, Angola and West
                            Irian.</p>
                        <p>Averoff said that <persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName>
                            understood about these different policies: His essential thinking was
                            that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> powers should be agreed
                            on a policy against Communism.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> reiterated that the U.S.
                            should make itself the spokesman of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                        <p>When the President returned he said that President Truman was on the
                            phone and Truman and <persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName>
                            talked. <persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> delivered a
                            cordial invitation to Truman to come to Greece “this year.” Truman said
                            he would think it over and wondered who might arrange such a trip. The
                            President left the room while this call was in process, but when he
                            returned he said at the request of <persName corresp="#p_C1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName> that he would encourage Truman to go.</p>
                        <p>When the conversation again returned to substance, the President said he
                            expected to see General DeGaulle in early June. He had seen Macmillan
                            and <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> and their views
                            appeared to coincide closely with the views of <persName corresp="#p_C1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName>. The Prime Minister replied he had seen
                            Macmillan about two months ago and they had reached agreement regarding
                                consultation.<note n="5" xml:id="d312fn5">President <persName

                        <p>The President said that an effort would be made to lay the groundwork for
                            a heads of state meeting. If such a meeting takes place it must have a
                            firm foundation—it must not be simply a ceremonial meeting.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> agreed and said that the
                            heads of state should, at a “propitious moment,” sit down and face
                            frankly such issues as armament.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> said that he wished to
                            draw to the President’s attention the special Greek interest in the
                            Balkans and the Middle East. Greece was European, but rather far away.
                            For centuries it had been subjected to pressures from its neighbors to
                            the north. These pressures are greater today since Greece’s neighbors
                            are Communists and determined to push to the Aegean. He said that Greece
                            was in a delicate and even “critical” situation. It was trying to
                            preserve equilibrium in the Balkans and was sacrificing to do this.
                                <persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> went on to say that
                            Greece is the link between Turkey and Yugoslavia. So far as the latter
                            country was concerned Greece would be satisfied if it stuck to its
                            neutral policy. At this point an urgent telephone call came through to
                            the President and some minutes passed while he dealt with it. The
                            Secretary commented to the Greek party that the situation in Cuba was
                            very disturbing.</p>
                        <pb n="612" xml:id="pg_612" facs="0634"/>
                        <p>The general conversation ended at this point. The President and <persName
                                corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> went for a walk in the garden
                            and the remainder of the group waited in the President’s office talking
                            in a desultory way until their return.</p>

                                    <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName>, after thanking
                                the President for the courtesies extended during his Washington

                                The message was forwarded to the Department of State in airgram A–20

                            aside, saying that he would be responding to it promptly and that the

                                corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> would have the direct and
                            careful attention of the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>In discussing Mr. <persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName>’
                            letter, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LA1">Liatis</persName> made the point
                            that the Greek Prime Minister is personally and most particularly
                            interested in the economic program for Greece. He very much wants to get
                            forward with it this year for a variety of reasons, including the
                            example a prosperous Greece would set for the rest of the underdeveloped
                            world. <pb n="613" xml:id="pg_613" facs="0635"/>The Secretary merely
                            commented that as the Ambassador knew the Administration had not yet
                            gotten its foreign aid bill through the Congress: a great deal of what
                            we could do would depend not only upon the authorization but also upon
                            the appropriations bill. We were having difficulty because of the 5-year
                            lending authority which we seek, but the Secretary was hopeful.</p>
                        <p>As regards the military aspects of the Prime Minister’s letter, the
                            Ambassador had little substantive to add, merely noting that the
                            assist-ance sought would bring it more closely into conformity with
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> requirements, and that
                            essentially what was desired was that the programs already elaborated
                            between <gloss target="#t_JUSMMAT1">JUSMMAT</gloss> and the Greek
                            Government be expedited.</p>
                        <p>Again asserting that the Ambassador could be certain that the Prime
                            Minister’s letter would receive our immediate and careful attention, the
                            Secretary raised the question of the Greek position regarding the
                            maximum tariff on tobacco vis-à-vis the <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                                >EEC</gloss>. The Ambassador first commented that it was premature
                            for the Greeks to act vis-à-vis <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                            since Greece is not yet formally a member of that organization.
                            Following some discussion, he elaborated that the principal difficulty
                            was that tobacco was a very sensitive issue in Greece, and that any
                            Greek action which smacks of being a concession to the United States in
                            respect to tobacco is political dynamite. Following some further
                            conversation during which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LA1"
                                >Liatis</persName> admitted that he had discussed the issue
                            cursorily with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> prior
                            to his departure from Athens, and undertook to review his own files
                            concerning the conversation between Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> and Mr. <persName>Protopapadakis</persName> in
                            Paris, the Secretary asked if he could have his colleagues “snap at the
                            Ambassador’s heels on this matter”. The Secretary concluded that this
                            was an issue we wished to resolve as quickly as possible and the matter
                            was left that the Department would follow up with Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_LA1">Liatis</persName>.</p>
                        <p>As the meeting was breaking up, the Ambassador asked concerning Berlin
                            and the Secretary’s labors in respect thereto. The Secretary pointed out
                            that he was going to Paris this weekend and following conversations with
                            the British, French and Germans would speak with the North Atlantic
                            Council on Tuesday. Upon his return to Washington he would no doubt be
                            in consultation with the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            Ambassadors because he foresaw that, as the crisis developed, there
                            would be a great deal to do. He noted in this connection that we were
                            most grateful for Greece’s staunch support as regards the Berlin issue,
                            to which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LA1">Liatis</persName> replied
                            that we should never be in any doubt regarding Greece’s position on such
                            matters. The Secretary inquired as to the Ambassador’s personal plans,
                            and was told that the Ambassador would be available in Washington
                            throughout the summer.</p>

                        <p>330. 1. Net impression of half hour talk with King
                                <persName>Paul</persName> today, Crown Prince present, is that while
                            steadfastly “on our side” he has been doing relatively little homework
                            during past two months vacation on Corfu, with only occasional brief
                            visits to mainland, and the grim potentials of advancing international
                            situation have yet to sink in. (This tallies with information reaching
                            us from other sources; it contrasts with word that Queen is deeply
                            concerned.) Royal family, minus Crown Prince who remains as regent at
                            government’s request, depart tomorrow <pb n="615" xml:id="pg_615"

                            be gone two weeks. (Absence from country being shortened on urging of
                            government.) King observed that he can always get back to Athens in
                            three hours, should circumstances require.</p>
                        <p>2. King spoke highly of morale and readiness Greek Armed Forces, this in
                            connection his visit to recent annual maneuvers in Kastoria area. He
                            referred to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s threat
                            to atomize Acropolis as having salutary effect of uniting “all Greeks
                            except Communists” and with appreciation to Prime Minister’s
                                response.<note n="1" xml:id="d315fn1">During an August 10 reception

                                told the Greek Ambassador that in the event of war the Soviet Union

                                replied that he would “destroy the whole thing.” (Telegram 503 from

                            electoral prospects.</p>
                        <p>3. On elections, he said he does not believe Prime Minister has yet made
                            up his mind since latter is somewhat reluctant schedule campaign in what
                            may turn out be period international tension. He indicated <persName

                            to Athens September 13. (All other evidence points to <persName

                            with announcement probably to be made later this month.) Prime Minister

                            ends vacation today, opens Thessaloniki Fair tomorrow and returns to

                        <p>4. King also remarked that Moscow behavior has diminished chances of

                                >EDA</gloss>, and increased prospect that <persName corresp="#p_PG1"

                                within the scope of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. (Ibid.,
                                780.54/9–361)</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName>’ immediate reaction was
                            to inquire <pb n="617" xml:id="pg_617" facs="0639"/>whether this <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> guarantee or direct US assurance.
                            After discussion in detail and some reflection his part, <persName
                                corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName>, who in calm unruffled mood,
                            said he appreciated this reply from US to his request but wanted to say
                            in all frankness it did not fully satisfy him. Asked to elaborate, Prime
                            Minister went on to say record is clear that he and Greek Government
                            have given strong support to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> but
                            that he frankly lacks confidence in ability of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> to come immediately to aid of Greece in event of
                            attack on this country. He pointed to pulling and hauling involved in
                            all <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> decisions, mentioning doubts
                            re British and Italian readiness face up to hard decisions involved in
                            present crisis. He called attention, as he often does, to Greek
                            geographic position, saying if Belgium or Holland attacked other Western
                            European powers immediately involved because of geography, but this not
                            necessarily so in case of Greece with her position separate from rest of
                            European <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He said he had discussed
                            his preoccupations about <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> with
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> during his July
                            visit. He said again this morning that he and Greek people know what
                            they must do and will do it. There is no doubt, however, Prime Minister
                            would like to have US assurances of direct and immediate support for
                            Greece in case of trouble without waiting for results of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> deliberations.</p>
                        <p>2. In short, what <persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> wants
                            is simple US statement to effect we are on Greece’s side and have no
                            intention letting Greece go down Soviet drainpipe. Reassurances along
                            these lines would have more positive effect than assurances re <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> commitment which regarded here as
                            useful but rather legalistic.</p>
                        <p>3. Same exercise repeated later in morning with Foreign Minister, who was
                            attended by Director General Palamas. They had been advised of <persName

                                        from Athens, September 3, reported Averoff’s response to the
                                        Bulgarian demarche. (Department of State, Central Files,
                                        780.54/9–361)</note> declaring it couched in unacceptable
                                    terms, and abruptly dismissing charge. Frontistis considers
                                    Bulgarian claims (in Athens and Sofia) to be worried about Greek
                                    actions not genuine, but merely propaganda. Greeks believe
                                    Bulgarians are increasing forces by holding conscripts longer
                                    and by calling additional conscripts and reservists, but note
                                    that an apparent increase of 20–25,000 is partly due to seasonal
                                    factors so that actual increase is about 15,000. Frontistis
                                    believes many of signs of reinforcement (temporary closing of
                                    roads to diplomats, stationing of tanks where clearly in

                                juncture could mean protracted renegotiation of agreement already

                                bond question was ultimately solved through bilateral discussions
                                between the bondholders representatives and the Greek Government. An

                            belief we are heading for trouble in Greece.</p>
                        <p>There has been much Washington publicity in recent months that under our
                            new aid policies America means to help those who help themselves and
                            that we intend to give our assistance especially to those who share our
                            view of the world et cetera. Greeks hold strong convictions, which we in
                            Embassy share, they meet both these criteria.</p>
                        <p>We do not see how we can overlook fact that Greece has to live with three
                            communist neighbors on its Northern boundary, or that Greece is subject
                            to continuing feints and threats from Soviet bloc. (Latest one, as
                            recently as last week, received official notice by Department. Moreover
                            it has not escaped our Greek allies that we have within week announced
                            substantial additional aid program for one of their Communist
                            neighbors.)</p>
                        <p>Nor can we ignore ominous shadow cast by events in Berlin in this part of
                            the world. In that connection, Greece responded promptly and loyally to
                            Berlin build-up plans. Since it has been long agreed that Greece is
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> country which requires outside
                            assistance in her military effort if her economic development is not to
                            be critically handicapped, perhaps Greeks may be excused by [<hi
                                rend="italic">if</hi>] they thought they would have adequate help on
                            their military effort taken in wake of Berlin. At all events they went
                            ahead on their build-up per request, and surely that stoutness of
                            attitude is worth something to us in these times.</p>
                        <p>No one is more anxious than I to see Greece’s economic development
                            proceed apace. Great strides have been made in past decade and there is
                            general agreement the next three or four years may be crucial. This is
                            precisely why I consider aid decisions re Greece for FY 62 and 63 to
                            have such special importance. Whatever its faults, new Greek Government
                                <pb n="626" xml:id="pg_626" facs="0648"/>formed after last fall
                            elections is best aggregation of progressive talent Greece has had since
                            war. With government stability and sound, progressive economic
                            leadership on Greek side, and with judicious mixture of advice and
                            financial assistance on our part—and with some luck—we could within
                            three or four years actually see Greece able stand on her own feet for
                            first time in modern history. That to my way of thinking is an objective
                            worth keeping constantly before us.</p>
                        <p>Aid to Greece should not by any means be considered a “reward for good
                            behavior”, but rather an investment toward sound and attainable mutual
                            goals. We are getting good return on our investment.</p>
                        <p>True enough, current statistics are optimistic on Greece’s foreign
                            exchange reserves and balance of payment position. I personally do not
                            believe situation here is nearly so rose-colored as these figures appear
                            to imply to some economists. With Greek history in mind and with
                            knowledge that almost one third Greek exports now go to eastern bloc,
                            statistics alone can be insecure basis for decision. To establish FY
                            1962 aid levels for Greece mainly on economic grounds and without
                            adequate weight being given to political and psychological factors, not
                            to mention harsh military realities imposed by Greece’s geographic
                            position and by Berlin situation, would in my judgment be a great
                            mistake for US Government to make.</p>
                        <p>These matters have now been before appropriate Washington officials for
                            many weeks. Our Greek allies, handicapped in their own budgeting, are
                            becoming understandably restive and concerned. I once more, in all
                            seriousness, bespeak aid level adequate and appropriate to Greece’s
                            need, as specified in repeated communications from Athens and Paris. I
                            do so in belief that on our decision in this matter may well depend
                            character of our relations with this threatened and exposed ally during
                            predictable future.<note n="2" xml:id="d325fn2">In <gloss

                        </list>
                        <p>The Secretary began the discussion by asking if the Mission had any
                            unresolved anxieties which they wished to discuss. Mr.
                                <persName>Ferguson</persName> stated that there were two. In the
                            first place, the Mission would find it very difficult to make a judgment
                            on whether Greece and Turkey should be pressed to increase their
                            military strength to meet Force Goals and suggest that additional
                            assistance be made available to permit them to do this. That is, the
                            Mission would not be able to suggest that these two countries should be
                            singled out for special assistance for this purpose, although if they
                            did try to meet <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Force Goals, they
                            would need special assistance.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, so far as economic assistance was concerned, there appeared to
                            be general agreement on the requirements of Turkey. However, the Mission
                            felt that Greece would need “unorthodox” aid for a transitional period
                            of two to three years. During this two to three year period, loans
                            limited to the foreign exchange costs of projects would not
                            satisfactorily meet the problem because the Greeks would have difficulty
                            in mobilizing the needed domestic resources. Mr. <persName>von
                                Mangoldt</persName> said the Greek capital market was still limited
                            and could not be depended upon to provide the necessary resources. With
                            time he felt it would grow. Mr. <persName>Ferguson</persName> noted that
                            the Greeks could raise drachma for their investment program if they cut
                            their defense expenditures, but <pb n="628" xml:id="pg_628" facs="0650"
                            />the Mission would not want to make such a recommendation. Mr.
                                <persName>von Mangoldt</persName> said the Mission understood the
                            United States decision to terminate the grant assistance to Greece, but
                            he believed that loans should be made available to cover not simply the
                            foreign exchange costs of projects.</p>
                        <p>In response to the Secretary’s question as to what the order of magnitude
                            would be, Mr. <persName>Ferguson</persName> replied that the Greeks
                            might need external assistance of $20–30 million annually in 1963 and
                            1964, after allowing for assistance they would get from the European
                            Investment Bank. This would provide the same type of assistance to the
                            Greeks as they had received previously in the form of Defense Support
                            funds from the United States, and assumes no rapid increase in military
                            strength to meet <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Force Goals. This
                            presents a difficult technical problem, Mr.
                                <persName>Ferguson</persName> stated, but it was only a technical
                            one and not a major one. The Secretary then asked if there would be any
                            problem created if the Mission reported an uncovered gap. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said he thought this was not a
                            problem and suggested there might be some advantage to reporting the
                            minimum requirements of Greece, even if it could not be guaranteed these
                            would be met. Mr. <persName>Ferguson</persName> added that the Mission’s
                            report will identify the needs, try to get <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> to agree on the reasonableness of the needs and leave
                            to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members to decide if they
                            are willing to commit themselves to acting on these requirements. This
                            type of report would have a bearing on the use the Greeks make of their
                            internal resources.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Faure</persName> asked again about <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>’s role in dealing with the Greek-Turkish problem and
                            whether this should be done directly or indirectly. He suggested that
                            the military assistance might be handled within <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> while economic assistance could be handled outside
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The Secretary said this is
                            our preference too. Mr. <persName>Faure</persName> then asked whether
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> might not participate as an
                            observer in any consortium, even on economic assistance, that might be
                            arranged. Mr. <persName>von Mangoldt</persName> said from his <gloss
                                target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> experience, he knew this would give
                            the neutrals trouble. The best formulation, Mr.
                                <persName>Ferguson</persName> stated, would be for the individual
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members, as separate
                            Governments, to agree to take some action. The Secretary added that the
                            report could recommend to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> that
                            further action properly belongs in other organizations. He noted that if
                            action were taken in <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>, the
                            delegates in the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> are, after all,
                            not strangers to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, many represent
                            the same Governments and will be acting under instructions from their
                            Governments. It is the governments which would be acting, rather than
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> as such. Mr.
                                <persName>Faure</persName> said he thought we were right.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Ferguson</persName> referred to previous resolutions in
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> on Greece and Turkey and said
                            the Greeks and Turks would feel deceived if the same thing were to
                            happen again. The Secretary expressed hope that <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> delegates would be prepared to say that the Delegate’s
                            government, <pb n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0651"/>and not only that
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> as an organization, accepts
                            the report. He then raised a question about a <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> military fund. Mr. <persName>Faure</persName> said
                            there are two proposals—one for a military fund and the other for an
                            economic fund. The latter, which was a mutual assistance fund mainly for
                            defense support, had been mentioned previously by Foreign Minister
                            Averoff at the Oslo meeting but the Greeks, who were supposed to submit
                            memoranda on the subject, have never done so. Mr.
                                <persName>Vincent</persName> said he thought the Greeks meant a
                            mutual assistance fund for military assist-ance but supposed that the
                            Greeks were awaiting the outcome of the Mission’s report, before
                            pursuing the matter further. Greece appears to want a Special Fund
                            relating military and economic aspects of assistance and emphasizing the
                            importance of their tie-in to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Faure</persName> said the Mission must find some formula
                            which demonstrates the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> interest in
                            Greek-Turkish problems, or, at least, would not entirely conceal the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> role, but he admitted that the
                            Greeks would probably be satisfied if enough aid were forthcoming
                            regardless of its source. He asked whether, for example, if a consortium
                            encountered problems, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> could not
                            help by prodding. Mr. <persName>Ferguson</persName> said he thought this
                            was the responsibility of individual member governments. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> noted this is devolved on the
                            Secretary-General of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> to see that
                            the resolution approved was implemented by member governments. Mr.
                                <persName>Faure</persName> then asked the Secretary whether he had
                            any further thoughts he wished to pass on. The Secretary said there
                            might be a problem arising from the difference between any action that
                            might be taken as a result of the report and the expectations of Greece
                            and Turkey. Mr. <persName>Ferguson</persName> commented that he did not
                            believe the United States would have impossible problems in terms of
                            United States resources. He thought it important for the United States
                            to provide funds to Greece over and above the foreign exchange costs and
                            he believed <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> would have the funds and
                            flexibility to do this. Mr. <persName>Miner</persName> suggested this
                            would provide an opportunity for other <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> members to help and Mr. <persName>Ferguson</persName>
                            added this was exactly what the Mission had in mind.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary advised it would be good if both the Mission and the United
                            States Government would feel free in the next month to keep the channels
                            open for further exchanges of information. This was agreed to on all
                            sides and it was also agreed that Ambassador Tuthill in Paris would be
                            the logical point of contact.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>von Mangoldt</persName> said that on Turkey they had
                            nothing new to add. They could foresee that about $300 million a year
                            would be required in 1963 and after. Mr. <persName>Faure</persName> said
                            that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should take full cognizance
                            of the military burden which each country has and to meet in some way
                            the hopes of the Greeks and Turks and not simply relegate the problem on
                            the economic side to other international agencies. He understood that
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> could not, however, take
                            direct responsibility. The <pb n="630" xml:id="pg_630" facs="0652"
                            />Secretary asked whether we could not talk to the Greeks since,
                            although the problem is of direct concern to <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>, the means for dealing with it may require getting at
                            it outside <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The Secretary thought
                            that we might prepare Greece for the general approach that what is
                            needed is a commitment from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            Governments to follow through on action outside <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> since it is essentially governments who are involved
                            in this responsibility.</p>

                            <item>It is apparent that the Center Union’s campaign to nullify the
                                results of the October 29, 1961, elections is turning into a broader
                                and more fundamental attack on several of the governing institutions
                                of Greece; what started four months ago as a disgruntled effort on
                                the part of the defeated opposition to challenge the legitimacy of
                                the elections, and therefore of the <persName corresp="#p_C1"
                                    >Caramanlis</persName> Government, is becoming an effort to
                                challenge the legitimacy of certain Greek institutions, such as the
                                Palace, the military leadership, and the internal security forces
                                which, in the minds of the opposition, exerted undue influence on
                                the conduct of the elections. To understand the significance of this
                                challenge, and to estimate the lines of its probable development, it
                                is useful to consider briefly the electoral debate itself and to see

                            <item>The general charge advanced by the Center Union against the Dovas
                                Service Government is that the conduct of the elections was
                                characterized by force and fraudulence (“via kai nothia” in the
                                euphonic Greek phrase). The evidence adduced by the opposition to
                                support the charge falls into two categories: (a) evidence designed
                                to show that many voters, especially in the Athens area, were
                                illegally registered, and that military voting registers were not
                                made available to party repre-sentatives for inspection within the
                                time specified by law; and (b) evidence of police pressure on

                                conclusions about a “master plan” to rig the elections in favor of
                                    <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss>, objective examination of
                                the evidence makes clear that much of what the opposition has been
                                talking about is not malfeasance but nonfeasance. That is, with
                                respect to the civilian vote the opposition has proved numerous
                                technical violations of the law, especially as it affects the
                                registration of voters, but has failed notably to prove that the
                                elections as a whole were rigged. Thus, despite all the time that
                                the opposition has spent rooting through the registers, not a single
                                case of double voting has so far been proved and the Government has
                                been able to show that a number of illegally registered voters were
                                in fact supporters of the opposition.</item>

                            <item>With respect to the military vote and the activities of the police
                                and para-military TEA forces in the provinces the evidence, while

                                deliver a heavy vote for <persName corresp="#p_C1"
                                    >Caramanlis</persName> and that General <persName

                                the Hellenic Army and a long-time associate of the Prime Minister,
                                was deeply involved in the electioneering. The pre-electoral
                                activities of TEA and the gendarmerie do not appear to have been so
                                explicitly pro-<gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss>; the mission of
                                the internal security forces was to hold down the vote of the
                                extreme left. Nonetheless, in at least one instance, that of the
                                Police Chief in Methoni, the Courts have found evidence of
                                strong-arm methods employed against a non-Communist, and it is
                                permissible to question the wisdom of allowing provincial
                                constabulary to intervene in free elections even when motivated by
                                anti-Communism.</item>

                                following: (a) while there was no widespread adulteration of the
                                civilian vote, the administration of the elections was poor and open
                                to abuse by all parties; (b) the Army leadership was overly involved
                                in the campaign and inadequate restraints were placed on the
                                activities of the internal security forces in the pre-electoral
                                period.</item>

                            <item>It is probable, as some Government spokesmen have said, that
                                similar conclusions could have been drawn from any Greek election,
                                including those conducted by the present opposition leaders.
                                However, what was acceptable, or at any rate accepted, practice in
                                1951 or 1956 may not be so today. The Center Union, under the purple
                                banner of <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Papandreou</persName>’s
                                oratory, has ridden off in all directions and in so doing has
                                created much confusion about the real issues raised by its attack on
                                the election results. These issues do not, as the Center Union would
                                have us believe, pose the question, “who should govern Greece?” They
                                do, however, raise important questions about the way Greece should
                                be governed.</item>

                            <item>If we accept this line of reasoning, it becomes easier to see why
                                the Greek public’s response to the Center Union campaign has been
                                mixed and why the campaign itself has shifted emphasis so markedly
                                in recent weeks. There has from the beginning been a measure of
                                reserve and skepticism in the public’s attitude toward the Center
                                Union and especially toward its leadership. No serious observer of
                                the Greek political scene believes that <persName corresp="#p_PG1"
                                    >Papandreou</persName> and his ill-assorted coalition command as
                                much popular confidence as <persName corresp="#p_C1"
                                    >Caramanlis</persName>, and once this is admitted the most
                                extreme of the opposition charges become transparently ridiculous.
                                Many people believe, however, that the Palace, the Army leadership
                                and the internal security forces intervene too much in the political
                                life of Greece, and that the sluggishness of government
                                administration, its apparent unresponsiveness to individual needs,
                                has created a potentially dangerous gap between the governing class
                                and the governed.</item>

                            <item>For this reason public opinion, which was apathetic about the
                                Center Union’s attack on the election results, has appeared more
                                receptive to its attacks on the Palace. It explains why many
                                intellectuals who have little or no use for the leadership of the
                                Center Union nevertheless feel that in questioning the impartiality
                                of the Army leadership and the gendarmerie the opposition is
                                performing a useful service. Finally, it indicates how, almost
                                without realizing what they are doing, the Center Union leaders find
                                themselves conducting a very different campaign from the one they
                                began four months ago. In recent weeks the implicit issues have
                                simply become explicit.</item>

                            <item>Greece, it is often said, is in mid-passage, but the phrase is
                                usually used to describe a stage in the country’s economic
                                development. It is less widely understood that Greece is also in
                                mid-passage socially and politically. Methods of administration
                                appropriate to the conditions of prewar Greece; habits of thought
                                suitable to the period of the Bandit War; royal prerogatives which
                                survived in the atmosphere of an earlier and less enlightened time;
                                these are a few of the anachronisms whose continued existence vexes
                                the public and will trouble the Government <pb n="635"
                                    xml:id="pg_635" facs="0657"/>until they are resolved. These are
                                real issues, as opposed to the synthetic ones which the Center Union
                                introduced at the beginning of its campaign. The apathetic response
                                of the Greek public to <persName corresp="#p_PG1"
                                    >Papandreou</persName>’s attempt to discredit the elections
                                (which the public correctly identified as political opportunism)
                                has, in effect, forced the Center Union leadership to change the
                                focus of its attack.</item>
                            <label>10.</label>
                            <item>In these somewhat changed circumstances the danger to <persName
                                    corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> does not appear to be
                                especially serious at the moment. The immediate threat was
                                diminished as soon as it became clear that a majority of the Greek
                                public were extremely skeptical about the most violent and
                                politically-motivated of <persName corresp="#p_PG1"
                                    >Papandreou</persName>’s charges. When the Prime Minister was
                                able to ascertain that public confidence in the Government had not
                                been shaken, his position became simpler and his principal concern
                                one of holding together the versatile but high-strung group of men
                                who compose his present cabinet. So far, he has managed to do this
                                with consummate skill. Ministers whose personal loyalty he has
                                reason to doubt—Finance Minister Theotokis and Interior Minister
                                Rallis, in particular—have been those to whom he has assigned
                                responsibility for conducting the Government’s defense in
                                Parliament. This strategy has enabled the Prime Minister to avoid
                                direct participation in the election debate and has forced ministers
                                of untested reliability to commit themselves publicly on a subject
                                they might have preferred to finesse. The total effect has probably
                                been to strengthen the cohesiveness of the Government and to lessen
                                the danger that it can be brought down from within, as it was in
                                1958.</item>

                            <item>The Prime Minister’s success in holding together his cabinet also
                                strengthens his position with the Palace. An important objective of
                                the Center Union has been to convince the Royal Family and, to a
                                lesser extent, the American Embassy that the <persName
                                    corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> Government is “irregular”
                                and therefore a source of political instability in Greece. When the
                                opposition leaders call for a “transitional” government they are
                                appealing to the Palace to replace <persName corresp="#p_C1"
                                    >Caramanlis</persName> with some compromise candidate whom they
                                would support until new elections were held. Given the well-known
                                lack of personal rapport between <persName corresp="#p_C1"
                                    >Caramanlis</persName> and the Palace, the Center Union reasons
                                that this scheme might be acceptable to the Royal Family if they
                                become convinced (a) that the Prime Minister was not giving them
                                adequate protection from political attack, and (b) that a compromise
                                candidate of their own choice would receive widespread bipartisan
                                support in Parliament. In such a situation the likeliest candidate
                                would be Theotokis, who enjoys close personal relations with the
                                Royal Family, is well regarded by backbenchers of both Government
                                and center opposition, and has no great affection for <persName
                                    corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName>. Other, more remote
                                possibilities would be Rallis, Minister of Coordination <persName
                                    corresp="#p_PP1">Papaligouras</persName>, or Minister of
                                Commerce Pipinelis. It is <pb n="636" xml:id="pg_636" facs="0658"
                                />perfectly clear, however, that this strategy has little chance of
                                succeeding as long as <persName corresp="#p_C1"
                                    >Caramanlis</persName> remains in full command of his cabinet
                                and his party. In recent events, there is no sign that his grip is
                                relaxing or that rumored anxieties of the Royal Family are being
                                exploited to his political disadvantage.</item>

                                party recently addressed to the Armed Forces, denouncing their
                                present leaders as “unworthy”, was revised so often that its
                                eventual release was anticlimactic; lastly, at a time when public
                                interest is centered on Princess Sophie’s dowry, the financing of
                                the Queen’s Fund and other matters involving the Royal Family, the

                                concluding that the Government will ride out the present agitation.
                                In its fumbling way, the Center Union has found in the Palace and in
                                some questionable political activities of the military and internal

                                needs to fashion at least temporary solutions to the most pressing
                                of his problems. It is to be hoped that he will do more than that.
                                Basic reforms are long overdue in Greece’s internal security
                                legislation, in the way the country conducts its elections and in
                                the way the Royal Family comport themselves. The changing character
                                of the election debate has clearly demonstrated that it is in these

                            <item>I responded by stating I felt rejection report would be mistake
                                since such action would not help him achieve any results and same
                                time would tend alienate others, including many his friends. I very
                                definitely indicated outright rejection at this time would not be
                                well recd by United States. I gave this as my opinion and not result
                                any indication from United States. I indicated Greece could state
                                her objections parts report if she felt that had be done, but an
                                outright rejection would be most unproductive. This position clearly
                                had support Melas and I believe also Averoff. <gloss

                            <item>I reviewed my meeting with Frontistis on 7 March 62, taking

                        <p>The Secretary said that the key questions at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> Ministerial Meeting would be Berlin and disarmament.
                            On disarmament, it is clear that the Soviets will not accept inspection,
                            and without inspection there can be no disarmament. The Soviet position
                            is basically a propaganda position. This puts the US at a disadvantage
                            since US proposals are based on what we can genuinely accept and are,
                            therefore, more modest than Soviet propaganda recommendations. US
                            proposals are based on Stage 1 which would protect the land mass under
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and we would only move into
                            Stage 2 when we were sure of Soviet intentions.</p>
                        <pb n="640" xml:id="pg_640" facs="0662"/>
                        <p>The US expects the Soviets to resume nuclear testing. We would be glad to
                            stop tests under a nuclear treaty. If we could stop today, this would be
                            consistent with the security of the free world. If the Soviets do not
                            stop testing, however, we will compete with them. We have made
                            extraordinary efforts to reach agreement on ending all tests, without
                            success.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question from the Prime Minister, the Secretary said
                            that the French were not taking part in the disarmament discussions and
                            we assumed that this was due to their nuclear program. With regard to
                            the Germans, both on Berlin and nuclear testing, the US and German
                            positions were alike and we worked closely together. We would also have
                            to negotiate what disarmament would involve for other countries not now
                            directly participating in the discussions. It was essential that the
                            balance of forces not be disturbed at any stage.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Berlin</hi></p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted that during the Berlin crisis, attention is being
                            given to the central front where forcible intervention might occur.
                            During the discussion of the central front there has been less
                            consideration of other fronts, including the US, and this has opened up
                            the question on whether there is less interest in the other fronts. The
                            Secretary assured Greece that we consider our commitment is to all of
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, including Greece and that an
                            attack on any part of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would bring
                            into play <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces including US
                            forces, to that area. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                                >Kennedy</persName> wanted the Secretary to make this clear.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said he thought the Soviet Union took advantage of
                            ambiguities of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries to
                            create frictions. He thought we should agree on common positions among
                            ourselves and state these firmly to the Russians. The Secretary said
                            that the effectiveness of this approach could be illustrated by Berlin
                            where we have stated firmly that there is unanimous agreement by the
                            Western powers that the presence of Allied forces in Berlin and free
                            access to Berlin are not negotiable.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Aid to Greece</hi></p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that with a strong and more independent Europe,
                            the Alliance has a more difficult problem on consultation than in
                            previous years. He also noted that while <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> is primarily interested in the problems of the West
                            and in confrontation with the Soviets the US also has to take an
                            interest in problems of other areas of the world, particularly Latin
                            America and the Pacific. The US gives the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> area first priority in the struggle with the Soviets,
                            since Europe plus North America are central to this problem.</p>
                        <p>With the emergence of 50 to 60 newly independent countries, the US has
                            been called on for more foreign assistance and it is now particularly
                                <pb n="641" xml:id="pg_641" facs="0663"/>important that other
                            industrialized countries also contribute to such assistance. This is
                            important to the Alliance since the US could not continue to extend the
                            aid required without the participation of other countries. The US will
                            not do less than it has been doing, but is concerned that others do
                            their part, and, in this context, the idea of consortia is important.
                            Multilateral assistance, while adding to the unity of the Alliance also
                            complicates its task. From the point of view of the recipient country,
                            multilateral aid is not as simple or as comforting an arrangement as
                            bilateral arrangements, since it takes time to negotiate and is
                            complicated. This is one of the questions involved in the Wise Men’s
                            report on Greece and Turkey.</p>
                        <p>What is required at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial
                            Meeting in Athens is a moral commitment from the member countries of the
                            Alliance that the needs of Greece and Turkey are important and that the
                            members of the Alliance will move ahead to work out arrangements to meet
                            these needs. Ten years ago Greece was covered by the solid woolen
                            blanket of US assistance. Now the way must be opened to weave what in
                            America is called a “crazy quilt,” pieces of quilt which when put
                            together make a warm covering. It should not be difficult with the Greek
                            Ambassador, the US Ambassador and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SD1"
                                >Stikker</persName> to find a good combination. The US has in mind
                            such possibilities as infra-structure, which could be handled by Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Stikker</persName>, and development
                            loans, Export-Import Bank loans, and increased consumables in the
                            military assistance program, all of which could be handled here in
                            Athens. The US envisages such countries as the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss>, France and Germany participating in the combined
                            program, and the US is prepared to work quickly with all involved since
                            we realize that Greece has a time problem. The Secretary said he
                            believed that the important question was not what was in the Wise Men’s
                            report, and to which we understood the Greeks took exception, but that
                            the countries in the Alliance recognize the requirements of Greece and
                            commit themselves to do what was needed to meet them. Regarding the
                            magnitude of the Greek requirements, the US envisages intimate bilateral
                            consultations with the Greek Government in Athens on this question. It
                            was also important to undertake a multilateral program with other
                            interested countries, in which the US would have a large and active
                            role. The Secretary emphasized the strong interest of President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> in economic and
                            social development. It was in the US interest to encourage Greek
                            military strength and sustained economic development.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister agreed that the US principle was right but that Greece
                            found the Wise Men’s report unacceptable. The report not only does not
                            help Greece but creates difficulties in solving Greece’s problems. One
                            of the Wise Men, Edgar R. Faure, had said he was “ashamed” that he had
                            signed the report, since it was inaccurate and unjust. He had <pb
                                n="642" xml:id="pg_642" facs="0664"/>attempted to amend the report
                            but Greece understood that Mr. <persName>Ferguson</persName>, the
                            American, disagreed with this approach. Greece understands <persName
                                corresp="#p_SD1">Stikker</persName> had also expressed disagreement
                            with the report. <persName corresp="#p_NLGL1">Norstad</persName> was
                            also understood to have said the report was incorrect, but urged Greece
                            not to reject it. Since the question of the status of the report was now
                            a matter of prestige, <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Stikker</persName> had
                            suggested finding ways of ameliorating it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> said that the report
                            created three problems for Greece: (1) From an economic point of view,
                            the report created problems for the future since it was a bad appraisal
                            of the country’s economy and its needs, and its estimates and
                            conclusions would be used as guidelines in further consideration of
                            Greek needs; (2) it results in an internal political problem because if
                            the Government accepts the conclusions of the report, the political
                            opposition would charge that the Prime Minister had not done enough to
                            present the true situation; and (3) it creates an internal <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> problem since it gives rise to
                            bitterness. <persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> said that he
                            felt that they would be better off without the report.</p>
                        <p>On the economic side, the primary difficulty with the report, according
                            to <persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName>, was that the Wise
                            Men took into consideration only the balance of payments gap. <persName
                                corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> said Greece has a budget
                            deficit problem. If the Wise Men had considered the whole budget, i.e.,
                            the military, regular expenses and public investment, they would have
                            come out with a deficit of $150,000,000 for this year, compared with the
                            Wise Men’s estimate of a need for $30,000,000 each year. The Prime
                            Minister said that of this deficit Greece could raise $30,000,000 to
                            $40,000,000 through internal borrowing, leaving a deficit of
                            $110,000,000 which would have to be met by foreign assistance. Greece
                            has a five-year program on which it has already begun. If funds are not
                            found to continue this program <persName corresp="#p_C1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName> said he would have to stop this program which
                            is already successful. Public investment in economic infra-structure,
                            such as roads and electric power, was an absolute necessity in Greece
                            and if it were reduced this would have serious political and social
                            repercussions. On the military side, <persName corresp="#p_C1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName> said Greece cannot finance its military
                            programs through loans and, therefore, believed that external assistance
                            should be split between loans and grants.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> said that his economic
                            program had succeeded through his taking a hard political line and that
                            at this stage the program is at a critical turning-point. Greece feels
                            it is being abandoned, instead of appreciated, by the Wise Men’s
                            report.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> said that Greek
                            hospitality for the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting in
                            Athens does not permit her to reject the report, despite Greece’s strong
                            feelings on this subject. He could not accept the <persName
                                corresp="#p_SD1">Stikker</persName>–<gloss target="#t_NAC1"
                                >NAC</gloss> resolutions without amendments, since these resolutions
                            refer to the Wise Men’s report. The Secretary replied that the
                            resolutions also refer to <pb n="643" xml:id="pg_643" facs="0665"/>other
                            reports, including a Greek memorandum. He suggested that the Greek
                            Foreign Minister in accepting the resolutions at the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting could present a statement
                            making the points made by the Prime Minister in the conversation. If the
                            resolutions in their present form were accepted by the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries, Greece would have a
                            commitment from member governments that they would take all appropriate
                            measures to meet Greek needs. In the multilateral arrangements in the
                                <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> which would follow this
                            commitment, the US would inform other countries what we can do to assist
                            Greece, as leverage to obtain contributions from other Governments. The
                            Secretary assured <persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> that
                            the US had never let Greece down and would not do that now.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary went on to note that the US also has problems. Congress has
                            made important changes in the aid program requested by the President,
                            substantially reducing support assistance. The US also has a
                            balance-of-payments problem, chiefly because of its contribution to
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. In addition, the US has a
                            budgetary problem, largely due to its debt resulting from loans it had
                            made for its military programs. The Secretary said in the light of this
                            situation, he could not be expected to take back to our Government for
                            sympathetic consideration the Greek position that it could not finance
                            defense programs through loans.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the American proverb “There are many ways to skin
                            a cat,” was apt to the present situation. He had no doubt that a way
                            could be found to meet Greek needs if we could get a moral commitment
                            from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries at this <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting. The Secretary was inclined
                            to think that the public relations problem was most of the difficulty.
                            If this was so, the question is how to handle the problem of public
                            opinion and not to be concerned with the Wise Men’s report. The
                            Secretary said he was sure that when responsible governments in the
                                <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> consider Greek development
                            needs they will not be bound by the figures in the Wise Men’s
                            report.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> replied that he would not
                            bargain on a matter of principle and as he considered the Wise Men’s
                            report inaccurate and unjust, he could not accept it as a basis for
                            evaluation of the true Greek situation. He said he always had the
                            courage to tell the truth about his position and that of Greece, and
                            whatever decision was taken at the Athens meeting, Greece would remain
                            the most loyal ally in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and of the
                            US. Since Greece does not want to reject the Wise Men’s report at the
                            Athens meeting, <persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> said he
                            had amended the <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Stikker</persName>
                            resolutions both on substance and procedure. If the US could not accept
                            these revisions, <persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> said
                            Greece would have to reject the report.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we would consider the Prime Minister’s proposals and
                            let him know our position. The US is interested in the “inner reality”
                            of the Greek problem and a sound solution to this problem. Greece <pb
                                n="644" xml:id="pg_644" facs="0666"/>has an obligation to clarify at
                            the Athens meeting how Greece sees the situation since otherwise, other
                            governments might get the wrong impression of the Greek position.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister agreed and said he would submit his amendments to the
                            US Delegation early tomorrow morning.<note n="1" xml:id="d332fn1">No

                            Minister on the question of the defense budget is under study by State,
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and Defense.</p>
                        <p>The consensus remains that $175 million is a good figure and that the
                            United States Government should not permit itself to be pushed to
                            finance the higher <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss> estimate.
                            There is no military justification for the higher figure. From a purely
                            economic standpoint, there seems to be no need for increased U.S.
                            assistance. This problem—taken by itself—seems to be one of weaning the
                            Greeks from continued and interminable dependence upon us.</p>
                        <p>At this juncture there seems to be agreement within the government
                            agencies concerned on new tactics for dealing with the defense budget
                            problem. Until now we have insisted that $175 million was the <pb
                                n="645" xml:id="pg_645" facs="0667"/>optimum figure and there was no
                            justification for more. However, it is now being proposed that, instead
                            of a categorical reply, the Greeks be told the United States remains
                            committed to the $175 million target figure but if the Greeks feel that
                            $197 million is what they want, the United States would not object to
                            their seeking the additional $22 million from other non-U.S.
                            sources.</p>
                        <p>(Frankly, from my reading of the cables on the <persName corresp="#p_LH1"
                                >Labouisse</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> talks, I get the uneasy feeling that we are
                            focusing almost all our attention on symptomatic aspects of the basic
                            problem rather than the basic problem itself—the reason for <persName
                                corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName>’ mood and his entire
                            catalogue of complaints which clearly go beyond the specific military
                            and fiscal problems.)</p>
                        <p>As for handling the defense budget exercise, there are at least two
                            schools of thought. One is to let <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> write the President about this problem, as he
                            threatens to do; the other is to have the Secretary or Under Secretary
                            of State take the initiative and speak with the Greek Ambassador here,
                            spelling out the U.S. position, making it clear that there is an
                            absolute identity of views on this problem between the President and the
                            Secretary of State.</p>
                        <p>Bob Komer leans to the first approach—letting <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> write the President. Of course if <persName
                                corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> is determined to do this,
                            there is no way—or reason—to stop him. For our part, however, I think it
                            preferable that, in the first instance, the Secretary or Under Secretary
                            of State speak with the Greeks; try to probe their thinking a little
                            more carefully than has been done; attempt to convince them that as far
                            as the defense budget is concerned, we have studied the problem
                            carefully and sympathetically; we have come up with what seems to us the
                            right proposition; and that this decision is that of the U.S. Government
                            and not merely of the Department of State. <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> may still write the President, but, in my
                            view, the Secretary should delve into the problem and at least establish
                            its nature before the President becomes involved personally.<note n="2"

                            propose to provide it.</p>
                        <p>The Greeks have undoubtedly exaggerated the harm they will suffer by the
                            withdrawal of our defense support in 1963; they have chosen to look at
                            the “deeper implications.” I have lost no occasion to make clear to them
                            the basis for our decision and how we foresee they should be able to
                            solve their defense budget problem. Although they understand our
                            position intellectually, they continue to entertain a substantial
                            suspicion that we are drawing away from the intimate relationship which
                            has existed since the beginning of the Truman Doctrine.</p>
                        <p>It is only natural that unreasonable and exaggerated Greek reaction to
                            our policies should generate impatience on our part, however much we try
                            to avoid it. But I hope we will take Greek attitudes into account (as an
                            important and unavoidable factor in our problem) not only as concerns
                            the substance of our decisions, but also for the manner in which we
                            choose to carry them out.</p>
                        <p>More is at stake than the Greek defense program (which I hope we think is
                            important). The departments of our government enjoy many privileges in
                            this country. Because of our special relationship these privileges are
                            not only extensive but given ungrudgingly, without condition or demand
                            for quid pro quo. To the degree we dilute that relationship by what the
                            Greeks consider a lack of understanding, we will find it increasingly
                            harder to get and keep such privileges.</p>
                        <p>As this relationship is important to us and as there can be no question
                            of the Greek need for assistance in their defense effort, I feel
                            strongly that we should follow the line recommended by the Embassy,
                            particularly in <gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtels</gloss> 113 and

                        <p>Discussion centered on acceptance by Greeks discontinuance supporting

                            understands our problem in Greece and elsewhere on defense support. Want
                            do everything possible within limitations imposed by Congress strengthen
                                <persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> and strengthen
                            Greece. Will continue do so this year just as effectively as in past.
                            Details can’t be spelled out now but we do know we can’t give defense
                            support. No lessening of interest on part US; on contrary my presence
                            shows US interest increasing. US intends provide substantial assistance
                            in PL480, <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>, development loans; should
                            be as effective next year as last year. Defense support impossible.</p>

                            job, in terms self-help principle requiring recipient countries do their
                            part. For instance, if Greece will get its development loan applications
                            in order and present them to Amb <persName corresp="#p_LH1"
                                >Labouisse</persName> we will accelerate development loans.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_PRIMIN1">PriMin</gloss> described Greek development
                            programs, pointing out of $200 million annually, only about $30 from
                            Greek budget, rest from internal and external loans. Need for local
                            currency much more acute than need foreign exchange, and is limiting
                            factor in pace of development. Herein is importance defense support.
                            Twenty percent or less stated development requirements are for foreign
                            currency. Need local currency-generating form of aid if defense support
                            terminated. In development projects requiring large proportion foreign
                            currency, such as [omission in the source text] for good projects. Now
                            working with US Embassy on three year project provide loan for foreign
                            exchange such miscellaneous items as telephone system from US. This
                            unfortunately will not be helpful unless private Greek purchases from US
                            also included in order obtain more local currency for state investment
                            program.</p>
                        <p>Amb <persName corresp="#p_LH1">Labouisse</persName> noted such procedure
                            would in effect merely change budgetary support from grant to loan
                            basis.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> replied he was thinking
                            of general program loan, not tied specific projects.</p>
                        <p>At <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss>’s request, Amb <persName
                                corresp="#p_LH1">Labouisse</persName> explained US policy
                            development lending is oriented toward projects, not programs. As you
                            know, US stands ready with $10 million program loan. Question is
                            application such loans to private sector development. This is difficult
                            problem for us.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_PRIMIN1">PriMin</gloss> noted need local currency only
                            one of problems Greek development. Another is that current program
                            half-finished, which raises several problems: incomplete projects such
                            as dams, road, and irrigation systems requiring large amounts local
                            currency. Thus $10 million program loan important.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> said US going to give $10 million
                            program loan this year.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> then said we intend continue major
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> deliveries, probably increased
                            this year. Greece will receive 57 <gloss target="#t_M1">M</gloss>47
                            tanks, 263 OAPC’s, 24 8-inch howitzers, 120 SS-eleven missiles, one LST,
                            three minesweepers, and two squadrons F104 <gloss target="#t_G1"
                                >G</gloss>’s. This is illustrative of the kind of <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> we hope provide if we get what we ask
                            for from Congress. We also pleased over rate development Greece; more
                            remains to be done; we intend help Greece do it. In addition $10 million
                            program loan, we want act favorably on development loans and urge Greece
                            expedite presentation additional project loans. US will continue PL480
                            if we can end sterile talk <pb n="649" xml:id="pg_649" facs="0671"
                            />about defense support. Perhaps ways could be found through PL480 give
                            Greece other surplus products to generate local currency for
                            development.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> warned he could not make commitments,
                            and careful study necessary, but possibility exists using for instance
                            supply US surplus dairy products to generate more local currency for
                            economic development. <gloss target="#t_PRIMIN1">PriMin</gloss> remarked
                            he now paying price for making Greece self-sufficient in most
                            agricultural products US has in surplus.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PP1">Papaligouras</persName> said effort must be
                            made see what surplus US products Greece could absorb under PL480.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> asked if triangular trade
                            arrangement for PL480 could be worked out.</p>
                        <p>Vice President replied in negative, must be bilateral. Prime Minister has
                            effectively presented Greek case and we have explained our situation. We
                            trying find ways make our aid more effective FY 63 than FY 62 and desire
                            say so to press.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> noted one problem is
                            real. Other is how to present things to the public, and requested
                            discuss former first. Understand Vice President cannot make commitments.
                            Project loans solved foreign exchange but not local currency problem. US
                            has expressed willingness help Greek development. We have perhaps tended
                            act with defense support still in mind. Now no further question defense
                            support. We therefore will submit to Embassy within next ten days
                            everything we have in various projects and ideas for development
                            lending. Hope Vice President will exercise his influence see they
                            accepted to maximum possible extent, and do whatever he can to support
                            Greek proposals.</p>
                        <p>Vice President said this was constructive suggestion, far better than
                            bumping head against brick wall of defense support. US goal is a
                            peaceful, strong Greece. We can go this way by several roads. Last year
                            Greece got $90–100 million FY 62 <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>; if
                            President has his way on foreign aid bill Greece should get $80–100
                            million FY 63, including as before some commercial consumables.
                            Development lending is another road; in FY 62 we provided $10 million,
                            in FY 63 we are assuming $20 to $40 million, assuming our Congress comes
                            through and you find acceptable projects; this would be more than you
                            are getting now.</p>
                        <p>Papaligouris noted Greece has EDFO and National Bank loans already
                            approved, and hopes for Acheldos project loans; will see what other
                            projects can be submitted.</p>
                        <p>Vice President went on to note that roughly $100 million <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>, $40 million development lending, $20
                            million PL480 would make $160 million in US aid FY 63. Congress may cut,
                            but administration shooting for this size assistance to Greece. We can’t
                            work out details and should peg our actions on Prime Minister’s
                            constructive suggestion. I can’t say publicly <pb n="650"

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Averoff</persName> reported that he was under instruction
                            from the Prime Minister to express the latter’s distress on this matter.
                            He said this was ground which had been covered before and he only wished
                            to take time to make one point in this conversation.</p>
                        <p>He reported that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> reaction “had
                            not been bad” at the meeting of September 12. He gave as an example that
                            the Germans were hinting at $10,000,000. However, he wondered whether
                            the United States could not find some way to participate. He said that
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Stikker</persName> had a number of
                            suggestions for ways <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members could
                            participate: (a) in connection with the imports of the Greek Army; (b)
                            in the building of national strategic works (<gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> infra-structure). He explained that when Greece
                            approached other members, the members had a tendency to parry the
                            request with a question as to what the United States was doing. Mr.
                                <persName>Averoff</persName> said that the Greeks were giving them
                            facts and figures of the many forms of American aid to Greece, but that
                            United States participation in helping to solve this particular problem
                            would be most useful.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed the hope that the Greeks would be taking the
                            initiative with other governments. Mr. <persName>Averoff</persName>
                            indicated that he would not do so right now. He said the rationale being
                            used (Greece needs assistance because the Greeks are defending not only
                            Greece but other members of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>), is
                            not a very effective one coming from the Greek Foreign Minister. It is
                            an effective rationale coming from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SD1"
                                >Stikker</persName>, and the Greeks are holding back only until
                            after Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Stikker</persName> has moved in
                            this direction.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary explained to Mr. <persName>Averoff</persName> that any
                            United States initiative would not, in our opinion, be useful. He said
                            he would look into the question as to what the United States might do
                            with regard to the two types of participation Mr.
                                <persName>Averoff</persName> had mentioned.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Averoff</persName> called on the Secretary at his own
                            request.</p>
                        <p>He said he wished to let the Secretary know about the change in Greek
                            tactics in the campaign to obtain external assistance for Greek defense,
                            which has been necessitated because of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SD1"
                                >Stikker</persName>’s illness. As he had told the Secretary on
                            September 25, Greece had been counting heavily on Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SD1">Stikker</persName> who was a strong pillar of
                            support. Foreign Minister Averoff had instructed the Greek
                            representative at <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> to call upon all
                            the other representatives himself. Here in New York, Mr.
                                <persName>Averoff</persName> had talked very seriously with Foreign
                            Minister Piccioni of Italy. He said he had couched what he had to say in
                            the most friendly fashion but had argued very hard for Italian
                            assistance. He said one of his arguments had been that Greece had never
                            asked for reparations after the war when Italy was devastated. Now that
                            Italy was rich again, they owed something to Greece. He said Piccioni
                            had no reply except to laugh with Averoff who had made this argument, he
                            said, in a joking way but felt it had force. Mr.
                                <persName>Averoff</persName> said he had also spoken with Mr.
                                <persName>Spaak</persName>, who he believed was personally
                            sympathetic; but he wondered whether the Belgian Government policy would
                            permit anything to be done. He made the point that even a little
                            assistance from Belgium, perhaps in materials, should be a very strong
                            stimulus for Italy to do more. He said he might be able to see Foreign
                            Minister Luns of the Netherlands in Europe.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary indicated approval of these actions and said that this was
                            the kind of initiative the U.S. had wished so that we would be in a
                            position to support it.<note n="1" xml:id="d337fn1">In <gloss

                                Athens as telegram 433, the Department of State commented that it
                                was encouraged by Greek efforts to stimulate donor contributions and
                                instructed the Permanent Representative to <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                    >NATO</gloss> to follow up on Greek approaches, stressing U.S.

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Averoff</persName> went on to underline the importance for
                            Greece of obtaining this assistance for its defense needs. He said that
                            it was, of course, partly a financial problem for Greece. He said that
                            Greece had one and a half million people whose incomes were in the
                            $50–$80 per year range; but, he added, the significance was also
                            political. He said he was confident that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> would remain in power—that the regime was
                            stable. He said, however, that the opposition was extremely bitter and
                            “was attacking everything.” If assistance was not forthcoming, the
                            opposition would argue that the Greek Government, having lost U.S. aid,
                            had made a mistake in placing its confidence in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. The Secretary bantered with him concerning U.S. aid,
                            pointing out that it was because Greece had been doing so well that it
                            had lost one type of aid from us. Mr. <persName>Averoff</persName>
                            agreed that progress had been made but said he only wished to say that
                            it was not yet enough.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Averoff</persName> mentioned the fact that, when he had
                            gone to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s Reception,
                            he had been greeted in a very unfriendly way. When Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> saw him coming, he had called
                            out to him: “I see you are sharpening your knives against us.” Mr.
                                <persName>Averoff</persName> said he had explained that Greece had
                            lived in a very dangerous part of the world for over three thousand
                            years and was only interested in keeping its independence. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Matsas</persName> stressed the public
                            rudeness of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s
                            treatment.</p>

                            <item>At his request, I called on Prime Minister yesterday afternoon. He
                                said he wanted to tell me frankly of his great disappointment and
                                concern over apparent failure of consortium. He was confirmed in his
                                belief that Greece’s allies did not understand true situation, that
                                their analysis was not same as his and that he was in better
                                position than they to judge requirements of situation and
                                consequences of failure. There had been more stability, political
                                and economic, during his administration than in all modern Greece’s
                                history. This, he believed, was because he had followed the correct
                                policies. But, in spite of progress to date, much remained to be
                                done. If he could not obtain the necessary assist-ance now to enable
                                him to complete the task, all recent progress could be lost in brief
                                time.</item>

                            <item>He indicated he had in mind making a public statement announcing
                                withdrawal from consortium and a return to bilateral dealings. He
                                stated that he would take no action of this nature pending December
                                meeting of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council. He asked
                                that we help him in bringing pressure to bear on other <gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries. He emphasized the
                                serious political and psychological aspects of failure of
                                consortium, not only internally for him and his government but also
                                for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> as a whole.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>I told the Prime Minister that we had already used our best
                                efforts with other potential contributors and would continue to do
                                so. I repeated to him all that the US had done and was doing by way
                                of aiding Greece and stressed that we thought the record a good one.
                                I, too, emphasized the practical as well as political and
                                psychological problems we have in continuing aid to Greece with our
                                reduced appropriations, increasing demands, <gloss target="#t_BP1"
                                    >B/P</gloss> deficit, etc. (I mentioned particularly economic
                                and psychological problem of aid to country whose reserves
                                increasing, to which he replied that reserves would soon disappear
                                if economic progress does not continue.) With respect to other
                                countries, I gave it as my personal opinion that some of them could
                                do more. I then said to him that there were indications that
                                satisfactory results might be obtained for support of the Greek
                                defense budget and that this should be considered a real
                                accomplishment. With respect to the consortium, I <pb n="656"
                                    xml:id="pg_656" facs="0678"/>pointed out that this was not just
                                a one-shot operation but also a long-range one. I emphasized that
                                any hasty action in withdrawing would have serious consequences, for
                                Greece would continue to require external aid and must look for it
                                to the same countries who are members of the consortium. Withdrawal
                                would only serve to annoy and make more difficult achievement of his
                                government’s long-range objectives. Rather than withdrawal, I
                                cautioned him to seek to explain to the public, that, in fact,
                                Greece would receive substantial aid in 1963 and that consortium
                                would continue to deal with Greece’s needs.</item>

                                situation. In latter connection, both government and opposition
                                press have been active in denouncing failure of consortium to

                                    fairly closely line he has been taking over past several months,
                                    he appeared more dejected than before. In addition, his pitch
                                    was not so much that US should contribute more, but rather that
                                        <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries as whole had
                                    failed to meet critical situation. He referred three times to
                                    humiliating nature of his position and also to his belief that
                                        <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> image will suffer. I
                                    believe he is sincerely concerned. He expects and obviously will
                                    receive much criticism from opposition and public that he has
                                    failed to present Greece’s case adequately. Fact that Turkish
                                    consortium appears to be going fairly well only aggravates his
                                    problems in this emotional atmosphere. This, I believe, is
                                    largely basis for his references to political and psychological
                                    factors. He is pinning last hopes on some action by <gloss

                                    through consortium are not increased by mid-December (when he
                                    must present his 1963 budget), his present frame of mind would
                                    seem to lead to public statement that whole exercise has been
                                    waste of time and effort and he will take his chances through

                                <p>(D) From reports we have received here from Greeks and through
                                        <gloss target="#t_USRO1">USRO</gloss>, it appears Greeks
                                    stand better chance of obtaining more new money for defense than
                                    for economic development. This could prove unfortunate for,

                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> review we did not touch upon
                            the Greek problem, which I gather may come up again at Paris. I am
                            concerned lest, wearing our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> hats,
                            we press for too high a Greek defense budget and <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> contributions thereto at the expense
                            of the equally important Greek development effort.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_LH1">Labouisse</persName> in Athens suggests that
                            the Greeks will end up increasing their 1963 defense budget to $185
                            million but cutting back their development plan by an even larger
                            amount. Since I gather that we would find acceptable a defense level of
                            $175 million, wouldn’t it be better (from our standpoint and that of the
                            Greeks themselves) to tell the Greeks so, and to tell our <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies to go higher on the economic
                            consortium rather than the defense side, if we can’t get them to do
                            both.</p>
                        <p>I don’t want to tie your hands on this complex matter, but I suggest we
                            tread softly on these “mix” issues, which involve quite substantial
                            cumulative US and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> outlays, until

                        <p>The Secretary said he knew Mr. <persName>Averoff</persName> realized that
                            the US Administration had a stronger and stronger political problem at
                            home on defense aid because the Congress kept asking what the Allies of
                            the US were doing both to help themselves and to help less wealthy
                            Allies. Mr. <persName>Averoff</persName> replied he thought that the
                            other members of the Alliance did not realize the full extent of the
                            Communist danger and as a result they were not doing in the defense
                            field what they should. In particular the people in Europe did not
                            understand the military threat and were therefore not ready to counter
                            it. The Secretary commented that it seemed governments were not making
                            enough of an effort to educate their people on the Soviet threat and
                            what was needed to meet it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Averoff</persName> said he had to agree that the failure of
                            the Alliance to mount an adequate conventional defense was due to
                            psychological and political reasons. The Alliance was not fully awake to
                            the dangers of local conventional wars. The Secretary remarked that
                            certainly the Berlin problem threw a special light on this situation.
                            Mr. <persName>Averoff</persName> said that was true but the Europeans
                            were counting on the US deterrent alone to protect them and not on
                            conventional forces. The Secretary stated one could perhaps understand
                            this type of reasoning better regarding the central front but one could
                            understand it even less for the flanks. He then asked <pb n="659"
                                xml:id="pg_659" facs="0681"/>Mr. <persName>Averoff</persName> what
                            information the Greek Government had concerning Bulgaria. In particular,
                            did the Greek Government think society was being thrown open to somewhat
                            freer discussion such as seemed to be taking place in the Soviet Union,
                            where more freedom of speech was being given to writers? Further, was
                            there a noticeable difference in living standards between the Greeks
                            living on the Bulgarian border and Bulgarians living 50 miles further
                            north?</p>
                        <p>Averoff replied the Bulgarians had found some scapegoats for their bad
                            economic situation. The Greeks did not feel any destalinization had
                            taken place in Bulgaria, because the Bulgarian regime was just as rigid
                            or even more so than in Stalin’s time. The Bulgarian army had been
                            reinforced. There was a lack of consumer goods. As to living standards,
                            these were appreciably lower in Bulgaria than in Greece. However, the
                            Bulgarian army was stronger than the Greek army and had means which the
                            Greek army didn’t have. They had advanced firing technology which only
                            the Soviets had in remainder of Communist world and had very modern
                            airplanes. Greek pilots were better trained than Bulgarian pilots but
                            Bulgaria’s planes were faster and could fly higher. He didn’t feel that
                            the Bulgarians intended to attack Greece on their own but thought the
                            Soviets considered Bulgaria a faithful Ally that could be used for any
                            purpose the Soviets desired. The Bulgarians were rightly called the
                            Prussians of the Balkans. If there was any Bulgarian attack the Greeks
                            would have to withdraw well inside Greek territory. This was hard on
                            morale within the Greek Government though the facts of the situation
                            were fortunately not known to the Greek population.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that apparently Greece was also concerned with
                            “forward strategy” and seemed to feel that the most likely danger was a
                            local war with conventional means. However, it was hard to imagine that
                            the Bulgarians might attack Greece without full Soviet backing and it
                            seemed questionable that the Soviets would wish to become involved to
                            that extent. Averoff replied that after Cuba one could be more
                            optimistic that the Soviets would not think that the West would accept
                            as a fait accompli a land grab carried out within 24 to 48 hours. That
                            seemed to be the real danger. The Soviets might rely on the theory that
                            the Allies would accept a limited extension, by the Soviets, of their
                            territory. This was the reason why Greece needed stronger armed forces
                            which could prevent occupation of Greek territory. However, Greece was
                            already spending for its armed forces more than it was spending for
                            education and for welfare together. This obviously created internal
                            political difficulties. There was for instance a strong drive in Greece

                            the expense of defense spending. If the Government instead put its money
                            into defense it was most important that it could say that the other
                            members of the Alliance were also helping this Greek defense effort.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PP1">Papaligouras</persName> added that at the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial meeting at Athens
                            it had been agreed to deal with the Greek military problem in <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and with the Greek economic problem
                            in the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>. So far, the <gloss
                                target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> Consortium for Economic Aid to Greece
                            had not produced anything. If the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            side failed too, the Greek economic problem and even more important, the
                            Greek political problem created by this failure would be very serious.
                            The Greek populace would interpret failure of the two exercises as a
                            refusal by the Alliance to help Greece. There would also be unfavorable
                            comparisons with Turkey. Greece wanted a strong Turkey and had been glad
                            yesterday to support the Turkish case in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. However, as he had stated to <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> Acting Secretary General Colonna 13 December it was
                            necessary that the pledges to Greek defense as recorded in the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> “protocol” be firmed up. Since
                            particularly Germany wanted to make its pledge conditional on pledges by
                            others, it might be desirable to postpone discussion of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> defense resolution on Greece from this
                            afternoon to tomorrow 15 December. The Secretary said he had talked to
                            German FonMinister Schroeder and the Germans were aware of the problem.
                            He could not say more on this at this time.</p>
                        <p>Averoff said that it was pertinent to recall that the personal prestige
                            of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> was engaged in
                            getting help from Greece’s allies. Nobody but Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> had the prestige to keep
                            Greece together, so it would be a very serious matter if Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> were to be unsuccessful in
                            his endeavor. Greece did not want to turn into another Turkey and face a
                                “post-<persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName>” situation.
                            This would not happen in Greece because the Greek army was sound and the
                            population was more advanced than in Turkey. Nevertheless, if Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> was hit seriously
                            by the opposition over the issue of aid to Greece this could lead to
                            political instability since there was nobody else who had the personal
                            prestige to do the job.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that while he was fully aware of Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName>’s great value to Greece and
                            to the Alliance he felt sure one would not want to think of the future
                            of a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> country in terms of one life
                            which might depend on a car accident. He recalled that when Mr.
                                <persName>Pusey</persName> who was then quite unknown, had been
                            offerred the presidency of Harvard he said that he simply did not have
                            the prestige to take on that type of job. The Harvard trustees replied
                            that the day after Mr. <persName>Pusey</persName> had become president
                            of Harvard he would have the necessary prestige. The Secretary of course
                            did not mean these words as any disparagement to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> who was so greatly admired
                            throughout the Alliance.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether the present pledges made in <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> if firmed up would not help the Greek
                            Government domestically. <persName corresp="#p_PP1"
                                >Papaligouras</persName> said yes they would. If $23.5 million were
                            made available that would certainly help, particularly if it was
                            “presented right” to the <pb n="661" xml:id="pg_661" facs="0683"/>Greek
                            people. The difficulty was of course that the Greek Government had
                            continuously been saying that something was going to be forthcoming from
                            Greece’s allies in the aid field and this event was being continuously
                            postponed. So it was important that a firm announcement should be made
                            now. The Secretary agreed this might be desirable but pointed out that
                            as of now the Greek delegation could not yet tell its Government that
                            the whole matter was settled in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.
                            Therefore, and in line with the wish of the Greek Delegation he would
                            suggest to Mr. <persName>Colonna</persName> that the Greek defense item
                            on the agenda this afternoon be postponed to tomorrow, 15 December.<note

                            at home Bacatselos was measured statement by Deputy Pasmatzides that

                                        >Karamanlis</persName> is a man of great ability and is
                                    completely loyal to the Crown, but he is becoming increasingly
                                    hard to get along with and occasionally shows bad judgment. As
                                    an example, she mentioned his ineffectiveness in protecting the
                                    Crown from public criticism, particularly where Royal financial
                                    matters were concerned such as the dowry for Princess Sophia’s

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: We have received disturbing
                            information this week concerning the organization of a possible coup
                            d’etat against the Greek Government. While the indications are that the
                            coup is not planned for the immediate future, the information, which
                            comes from General <persName corresp="#p_KV1">Kardamakis</persName>, the
                            recently retired Chief of Staff of the Greek Army, has such a ring of
                            authenticity that I believe you and the President should be advised
                            without delay of this possibility of an overturn in Greece some time in
                            the coming months.</p>
                        <p>The story was told by General <persName corresp="#p_KV1"
                                >Kardamakis</persName> to Colonel <persName>Baldry</persName>, our
                            Army attache. The following is the gist of Colonel
                                <persName>Baldry</persName>’s report to me.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">13–1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            Something would also have to be done about controlling the venal and
                            disruptive press.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_KV1">Kardamakis</persName> stated that the
                            decision for a coup d’etat has already been taken, that it is no longer
                            a question of whether, but when. General <persName corresp="#p_KV1"
                                >Kardamakis</persName> described the officer corps of the Army as
                            broadly divided into two groups, with the majority consisting of “truly
                            patriotic” strong, loyal officers who form a large bloc and look to him
                            as their leader. This group, he said, was fully organized—he supplied
                            names of some key officers—and capable of assuming power. They believe
                            that the time to strike will soon arrive.<note n="1" xml:id="d343fn1"

                                were Brigadier General Odesseus Angelis, Colonel <persName>Alexander
                                    Hatzipetros</persName>, and Lieutenant Colonel
                                    <persName>Georgios</persName> Papadopoulos. Colonel
                                    <persName>Baldry</persName> reported that Papadopoulos was “not
                                known to this office.” (Memorandum from Baldry to <persName
                                    corresp="#p_LH1">Labouisse</persName>, April 3;
                            ibid.)</note></p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">4 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] On the
                            other hand, he expressed the opinion that the sizeable left-leaning
                            element of the nationalist opposition would combine with the communists
                            to win the next elections. Dissatisfied with the present, this officer
                            group is not content to wait for elections and allow the latter to
                            happen. It, therefore, plans a military take-over before waiting until
                            blood would have to be spilled.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_KV1">Kardamakis</persName> said that he
                            himself felt that such a revolutionary step should be taken only as a
                            last resort and that he has been resisting heavy and mounting pressure
                            from the younger officers in the group for some time now. To get away
                            from this pressure he has decided to leave Greece at the end of the
                            month on an extended European trip with his wife, to be abroad two to
                            three months. He did not think the <pb n="665" xml:id="pg_665"
                                facs="0687"/>coup would take place in his absence, but he could not
                            guarantee it in view of the rising impatience of the officers (it could
                            also be that, if such a move is being planned, the General would prefer
                            to be out of the country at the time of execution so as to avoid
                            responsibility and would then expect to be called home to take over the
                            helm).</p>
                        <p>Colonel <persName>Baldry</persName> pointed out to General <persName
                                corresp="#p_KV1">Kardamakis</persName> the very serious consequences
                            both in domestic affairs and in Greece’s international relations which
                            would follow on such a coup and suggested various other possibilities of
                            easing the situation. The General was not, however, to be dissuaded and
                            expressed the determined conviction that a military coup is the only way
                            to bring about necessary reforms in Greece. After two years or so the
                            government could then be returned to the people under a new, stronger
                            constitution. The General stressed that the Army’s loyalty is to the
                            country and to the Crown.</p>
                        <p>As for our analysis of the above, General <persName corresp="#p_KV1"
                                >Kardamakis</persName> is known to us as a blunt, dedicated, but
                            opinionated officer who is not averse to using the Army for political
                            purposes and who is of the type inclined to feel that the Army is the
                            true guardian of the country’s honor and knows what is best for Greece.
                            His identification of other key officers in the conspiracy was
                            forthright, and there seems little reason to doubt his general
                            description of the forces at work among the officer corps. In short, his
                            presentation seemed sufficiently genuine and accurate to be greatly
                            disturbing.</p>
                        <p>We have from time to time had vague rumors and bits of information
                            concerning Army cliques, secret societies within the armed forces,
                            predictions that the Army would never allow nationalist opposition
                            leaders with any leftist tinge to take over in the event of electoral
                            victory and the like. Of late rumors have been somewhat on the increase.
                            However, we have considered that, despite rather feckless attempts of
                            the <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Papandreou</persName>–<persName
                                corresp="#p_VS1">Venizelos</persName> opposition to draw the Army
                            into politics, there was little likelihood of violent overturn in Greece

                            declassified</hi>]. In fact, one of the achievements of recent years in
                            Greece has been the removal of the Army from politics to a more proper
                            military role. If <persName corresp="#p_KV1">Kardamakis</persName> is
                            right in his appraisal of the situation, then we are indeed headed for
                            trouble here. [<hi rend="italic">2–1/2 lines of source text not

                        <p>In my judgment there is no remote justification in the present local
                            situation for the type of action General <persName corresp="#p_KV1"
                                >Kardamakis</persName> declares he and his group are planning and
                            which, unfortunately, they may well be in a position to carry out (the
                            appointment several months ago of the present Army Chief of Staff was
                            more or less forced on the government by the <persName corresp="#p_KV1"
                                >Kardamakis</persName> group, and the present Chairman of the Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff is regarded as a figurehead). [<hi rend="italic">13–1/2

                        <p>It would seem, however, that other factors also weigh heavily in the
                            balance: the impatience of the officer corps (which comes largely from
                            the economically less advanced rural areas) with social inequities and
                            with the pace of social reform, as well as irritation over the
                            inevitable loose ends of democracy, such as a largely irresponsible
                            press and petty venality, along with the fear that the next election
                            would result in a Popular Front Government. While there is no doubt some
                            corruption in the Greek bureaucracy, we have considered it to be of
                            rather mild proportions for this part of the world.</p>

                            of the sensitivity of the information we have not yet brought in any
                            other officers of the Mission. Colonel <persName>Baldry</persName> has
                            informed his superior, Major General Fitch, Army <gloss target="#t_G1"
                                >G</gloss>–2, by personal letter. I am sending a copy of this letter
                            to Phil <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> for his
                            information, but am making no other distribution.</p>
                        <p>I am planning to have Colonel <persName>Baldry</persName> arrange another
                            discussion in the near future with General <persName corresp="#p_KV1"
                                >Kardamakis</persName>, at which time he would be provided with a
                            carefully worked-out rundown of the fateful consequences to Greece of
                            this contemplated action. The General would be advised in emphatic terms
                            of the damage to Greece’s international reputation, the blow to <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> confidence in this country, the
                            dangers of upsetting the essentially fragile economic structure and the
                            creation of an instability which would frighten away the very investment
                            which is only now beginning to come to Greece and which the country so
                            desperately needs for its economic development.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Harry</hi>: The Secretary has asked me to
                            respond to your letter of April 5 to him. The information conveyed by
                            General <persName corresp="#p_KV1">Kardamakis</persName> to Colonel
                                <persName>Baldry</persName> is indeed disturbing and we would like
                            to be kept informed of any new developments resulting from subsequent
                            contacts with General <persName corresp="#p_KV1"
                            >Kardamakis</persName>.</p>
                        <p>We agree with your analysis there is no justification for the type of
                            action <persName corresp="#p_KV1">Kardamakis</persName> proposes. We
                            concur that it jeopardizes much of what has been accomplished in
                            Greece’s economic as well as military advancement. Such a “solution”
                            would be regarded as a blemish on Greece’s good name, particularly here
                            in the United States. In view of our long involvement and large
                            investment in Greece, we could not stand idly by and witness the
                            creation of a Latin American type of totalitarian government in Greece,
                            nor do we want a return to the Metaxas kind of tyranny. We are therefore
                            unalterably opposed to such a “solution” in Greece.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">2–1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] It
                            occurs to me that the General may be trying to justify action on lines
                            similar to the May 27 movement in Turkey. However, Greece’s economic
                            indicators belie him. The rate of Greek progress has indeed been most
                            impressive. [<hi rend="italic">4–1/2 lines of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] Some of the current frustrations with the social
                            system are a result of the economic progress of the last decade.</p>
                        <p>Your action in informing the General of the dire consequences to Greece
                            of such contemplated action was well taken. We would like to add that
                            Greece with a totalitarian government in the Balkans would be a
                            staggering blow to the cause of democracy in the area; the derogation of
                            democracy would be a source of satisfaction to Greece’s Communist
                            neighbors.</p>
                        <p>You may also indicate to <persName corresp="#p_KV1">Kardamakis</persName>
                            that the use of United States equipment to achieve such a “solution”
                            would be regarded with grave misgiving and disappointment by the United
                            States. Such a development would jeopardize <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                                >MAP</gloss> on a world-wide basis and add fuel to criticism from
                            some sources that it is used to displace democracy in its very homeland.
                            We would also find it difficult, if not impossible, to continue our
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> for Greece at anywhere near the
                            same magnitude as in <pb n="668" xml:id="pg_668" facs="0690"/>the past;
                            at a minimum it would cause a review of our military assist-ance
                            programming.</p>
                        <p>Obviously it is impossible for <persName corresp="#p_C1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName> to remain in power indefinitely and we are
                            prepared to cooperate with another government should it come to power
                            through constitutional means. We would not be diffident concerning the
                            possibility of working with such a government as long as the turnover
                            did not involve Communists or find them represented in the cabinet. In
                            the meantime we would not wish to do anything to compromise the
                            effectiveness of <persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName>’
                            Government as it still has considerable time to serve in office—nor can
                            a politician of <persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName>’ skill
                            be discounted in the next election by any means.</p>
                        <p>We are aware of the dilemma caused by the Center Union’s “inexorable”
                            struggle and realize that perhaps this causes anxiety and frustration
                            among various circles in Greece. A political pot that is warm or hot is
                            not, however, particularly unique in Greece. Consequently, we are not
                            unduly concerned about the Center campaign, although we would quite
                            obviously prefer the Center to focus its energy on Greece’s real problem
                            areas, rather than its present activities, including accusing the United
                            States of meddling in Greek affairs. Approaches similar to the General’s
                            probably point to one of the Center’s problems—the need to satisfy the
                            Army as to their attitude toward the monarchy in the short run.</p>
                        <p>Please keep us informed. I look forward to the opportunity the Istanbul
                            meeting will give us to review these problems.<note n="1"

                        </list>
                        <p>The President indicated to <persName corresp="#p_PP1"
                                >Papaligouras</persName> that we don’t want to push Greek military
                            expenditures to the point where it takes away from economic development.
                            The President said that the threat is always there but he doesn’t
                            anticipate any major attack on Greece or generally. DeGaulle might say
                            that the Americans couldn’t be trusted to defend Europe but <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> doesn’t know this and can’t
                            afford to take the risk. The President was aware of Greek concerns over
                            the Bulgar threat but said the Soviets won’t unleash the Bulgars ever if
                            they were stronger than at present (the major danger in Greece, as in
                            Italy, is internal). The President said Greece should concentrate on
                            internal growth. Let’s not have a Communist resurgence in Greece as in
                            Italy (<persName corresp="#p_PP1">Papaligouras</persName> indicated he
                            fully understood the President’s views but did not regard them as
                            incompatible with his own proposed policy of keeping the army at the
                            present level and keeping the defense budget at a level which would
                            allow for only a small annual growth, less than the increase in <gloss
                                target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_PP1"
                                >Papaligouras</persName> summarized Greek defense needs as being
                            hardware, plus $10 million in military consumables, plus commercial
                            credits (from Europe), plus around $20 million in externally generated
                            resources comparable to the $23 million which Greece got last year.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PP1">Papaligouras</persName> said that
                                <persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> had asked him to
                            appeal to the President personally to find ways and means of helping the
                            Greek military budget as we had in 1963. <persName corresp="#p_PP1"
                                >Papaligouras</persName> also expressed interest in U.S. support of
                            a smooth transition from a state of dependency to economic
                            self-sufficiency on Greece’s part. He hoped we could ease this
                            transition via further program loans and P.L. 480.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that we would take a look at all of the Greek
                            proposals and he asked that they be brought to his personal attention
                            (the President did not however make any commitment whatsoever on any

                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_PP1">Papaligouras</persName> reviewed his
                            meeting with the President. He said that he and the President had
                            explored the possibilities of a United States participation in the form
                            of a grant in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Greek defense
                            exercise in 1964. The only solution they had come up with was a 104(C),
                            PL–480 (Title I) component. The President requested that his staff
                            provide responses to the various requests made.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PP1">Papaligouras</persName> revealed that he
                            wanted to learn the attitude of the United States on these matters in
                            order to proceed with his planning. The <gloss target="#t_GOG1"
                                >GOG</gloss> needed a reaffirmation of United States support (not
                            that it is doubted) for internal political reasons. The Government has a
                            guns vs. butter problem with attendant manifestations—social pressures,
                            population movement, industrialization, unemployment and
                            underemployment—which create problems of a much more sophisticated
                            nature. A condensation of social pressures has resulted which, combined
                            with rising expectations, are of a more explosive nature than
                            heretofore. Greece must industrialize in 20 years to bridge the gap
                            between its per capita income of $365 and the much higher rate of
                            Western Europe with which Greece is now associated as a member of the
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>On the defense side, the Minister quoted the President as having said
                            that the United States does not want to push Greek military expenditures
                            to the point that they detract from domestic resources for development;
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and Messrs.
                                <persName>Kaysen</persName> and <persName>Komer</persName> of the
                            White House also put forth this attitude during the White House meeting.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> expressed some
                            concern that defense expenditures should not be cut drastically because
                            if the defense establishment of Greece went below a certain level,
                            stability might be jeopardized and an <pb n="671" xml:id="pg_671"
                                facs="0693"/>outside threat invited. <persName corresp="#p_PP1"
                                >Papaligouras</persName> agreed and explained that he had made these
                            identical points to the President who understood. What he and the
                            President had agreed was that military expenditures should not be
                            exaggerated. If in the past perhaps a too rapid build-up had occurred,
                            it had not been done only at the behest of the Greek generals; <gloss
                                target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> had also reported that the Greek
                            army was in a low state of preparedness. At the same time, the Bulgarian
                            army has been modernized and has taken an offensive posture as compared
                            to its former defensive nature. These things worry Greek army officers
                            and create potential internal political problems. Fortunately, the
                                <gloss target="#t_GNA1">GNA</gloss> is 100% loyal to the Government,
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the State; it is a
                            conservative force. The maintenance of the army is an important factor
                            politically, as well as being vital to sustain the morale of the people,
                            particularly along the frontiers. There must be continued stability to
                            set the stage for economic development and investment, which the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> hopes to stimulate and, thus, eliminate
                            the need for external assistance in a few years.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve de
                                Murville</persName> told him that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> was most impressed with the performance of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GNA1">GNA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PP1">Papaligouras</persName> went on to say
                            that defense costs will remain at approximately 1963 levels for the next
                            1–2 years, and noted that salaries and the modernization effect might
                            add a small amount, but nothing substantial. He recalled that Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated he would
                            look into ways to accelerate deliveries of <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                                >MAP</gloss> to enhance the modernization of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GNA1">GNA</gloss>. The Greek Government had the
                            impression that <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>, including
                            commercial consumables, would remain at previous levels ($100 million)
                            in FY 1964. The President and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                >McNamara</persName> had given the Minister assurances to this
                            effect.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense
                            exercise, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PP1">Papaligouras</persName> stated
                            that the United States policy of promoting burden sharing had been a
                            unique success. No such precedent had previously occurred. The <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> exercise for Greece should not be
                            permitted to collapse because the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            would not be able to replace the $23.4 million, which it obtained in
                            1963, from its own 1964 resources.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed that the exercise should continue, adding that
                            unless the Europeans recognize and accept their responsibilities, <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is going to experience increasing
                            difficulties. He asked if the $23 million had met the problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PP1">Papaligouras</persName> replied that a
                            satisfactory level of Greek defense has resulted (about $185 million).
                            The <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> realizes that the various force
                            levels set by the generals cannot be achieved, but if the same procedure
                            can be followed in 1964, a satisfactory situation will result. This
                            calls for a United States participation in the form of a grant under
                            PL–480 (104(C)). In this way the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            will be able to utilize the West German commitment of a $9 million grant
                            which was promised in 1964 <pb n="672" xml:id="pg_672" facs="0694"/>on
                            the condition that another major power would participate. The French
                            offered commercial credits in the 1963 exercise which Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PP1">Papaligouras</persName> said he refused because the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> found it unacceptable to finance
                            defense with commercial credits. One of the principal problems already
                            facing the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> is the large number of
                            commercial credits outstanding.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The Consortium</hi></p>
                        <p>On the Consortium, the Minister commented that he is hopeful that the
                            French would make a substantial contribution in the form of a loan. Mr.
                                <persName>Cochran</persName>, the American Consortium chairman, who
                            is doing an excellent job, believes there are favorable possibilities
                            for Greece in the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> Consortium.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated he was moderately optimistic because of the French
                            participation in the Consortium. He emphasized it is very important from
                            the United States Government’s view that the Consortium be supported.
                            The United States cannot return to a bilateral economic aid relationship
                            with Greece. The Secretary stressed the importance to Greece and the
                            United States that a mechanism continue to exist to meet the problem of
                            providing Greece’s external assistance requirements.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PP1">Papaligouras</persName> agreed to endeavor
                            to influence the Prime Minister and the Cabinet to stay in the
                            Consortium. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PP1">Papaligouras</persName>
                            admitted that creating a Consortium takes time. He said that the Prime
                            Minister, at the time he considered abandoning the <gloss
                                target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> Consortium, was primarily concerned
                            lest a disappointed Greek public adopt an anti-Western attitude as a
                            result of the apparent failure of the Consortium.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The Minister’s Five Wishes</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PP1">Papaligouras</persName> reviewed his “five
                            wishes”: (1) <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>, (2) commercial
                            consumables, (3) PL–480 (104(C)) and United States participation in the
                            1964 <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense exercise for Greece,
                            (4) 1964 program loan, and (5) project loans. On the first two the
                            President and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            had indicated that he could plan on the same level as in FY 1963. On the
                            last two, Mr. <persName>Bell</persName> and he had a constructive
                            conversation and he would not take the Secretary’s time with further
                            remarks on these points.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented he had the impression that <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and commercial consumables for FY 1964
                            were programmed at the same levels, but that commercial consumables over
                            the long-run would be phased-out. The decision on future levels of
                            commercial consumables would be decided after FY 1964.</p>
                        <pb n="673" xml:id="pg_673" facs="0695"/>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                                Confidence in United States</hi></p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented he has the feeling that Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> is less sure and confident
                            about his relationship with the United States than he should be. The
                            Secretary expressed the hope that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_C1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName>, in the future, will view the relationship
                            with more certainty. The United States realizes that the Prime Minister
                            has problems, like all political leaders, but hopes he realizes that
                            Greece is regarded as a special, more mature friend which, unlike
                            others, does not require periodic indications of reassurance. The
                            Secretary commented that perhaps the United States should publish aid
                            figures on a per capita basis in which case Greece would be at the head
                            of the list. The Prime Minister could perhaps use these figures to
                            reassure the Greek people.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PP1">Papaligouras</persName> replied that the
                            Prime Minister was upset about the termination of supporting assistance,
                            but now accepts the decision. The Minister remarked that without the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense exercise the situation
                            would have been grave. The Secretary answered that without the
                            termination of supporting assistance, there would not have been a <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense exercise for Greece. The
                            Minister agreed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary explained that the problem of meeting rising expectations
                            is built into the situation in each country. There are always
                            differences between hopes and expectations and what is realistic and
                            attainable. The United States has these problems in eighty countries.
                            Undoubtedly in the seventeen year period during which the United States
                            has rendered about $3.5 billion assistance to Greece, there has not been
                            a single year in which expectations were satisfied. All political
                            leaders have these problems and, hopefully, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> will adopt a more calm and
                            understanding attitude.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary ended the meeting by reaffirming the United States’
                            interest in supporting the Greek government’s initiative to engender
                            assistance from the other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> powers.
                            He agreed to look into the possibility of a PL-480 grant as a United
                            States contribution. He added that the Department would hope to obtain
                            responses to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PP1">Papaligouras</persName>’
                            requests to give him prior to his return.</p>

                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> resigned
                            on June 11, following a disagreement with the Royal family over their
                            desire for a State visit to the United Kingdom. The Prime Minister’s
                            resignation climaxed a long period of slowly increasing conflict with
                            the Royal family and came shortly after Georgios Lambrakis, an <gloss

                            terrorists during a political rally. The left charged government

                        <p>I called on the Prime Minister on July 2 at 10:30 a.m. He told me that he
                            was more optimistic than he had been last week about the general
                            situation. He sees his government as an interim one: to cover the Royal
                            visit and to prepare for elections. He thinks the visit will go well
                            enough. As soon as that is over, he hopes to be able to bring about the
                            passage of an acceptable electoral law, to be followed by early
                            elections. He would like to see <persName corresp="#p_C1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName> back in his old seat. He has already spoken
                            to the <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> leaders about the electoral
                            system. They want a majority system but might be willing to compromise.
                            He will see the leaders of the other parties and hopes to have some
                            understanding with them before parliament meets so that a new law can be
                            passed easily.</p>
                        <p>He said that <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Papandreou</persName> had just
                            made a statement that he wanted elections to be held in November (to
                            give more time to “ventilate” the country) but that he, Pipinelis, wants
                            earlier elections, “probably in October.” If he can obtain no agreement
                            from the parties, he will have to go forward on the old system—“this is
                            my threat.”</p>
                        <pb n="675" xml:id="pg_675" facs="0697"/>
                        <p>Pipinelis says that he does not want to see <gloss target="#t_ERE1"
                                >ERE</gloss> broken—“this would be a catastrophe.” On the other
                            hand, he says that the Center Union has already split.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the election, he said that the only real question was that of
                            the electoral law. Other matters, such as replacement of monarchs,
                            control of the Gendarmarie, Army voting, etc., he can deal with on his
                            own initiative. He mentioned, as an example, the success which he had
                            with the national radio, saying that representatives of the Center Union
                            and the Progressive Party sat with the director of the national radio to
                            ensure non-discriminatory action.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister is anxious to keep things moving forward, and realizes
                            the dangers of loss of momentum. His government must see that decisions
                            are taken on pending matters, wherever necessary.</p>
                        <p>I mentioned the need for a reply about the <gloss target="#t_VOA1"
                                >VOA</gloss> projected sites in the north. He said he would try to
                            let us have an answer in a day or two.</p>

                        <p>Before approving the proposed aide-memoire on U.S. aid to Greece arising
                            out of the <persName corresp="#p_PP1">Papaligouras</persName> visit, the
                            President would like the Department’s estimate of the Greek political
                            outlook. In particular he wonders what sort of alternative cabinets
                            could emerge from the current political crisis, and what the likely
                            implications for U.S. interests of each might be. If we face the
                            prospect of prolonged jockeying and possible renewed instability in
                            Greek politics, is there anything the U.S. could or should do about
                            it?</p>

                                cabinet crisis is one which will be relatively favorable to basic
                                United States interests—namely, a return of <persName

                                actions which could be construed as interference in Greek domestic
                                politics would almost certainly reduce rather than enhance this
                                probability, and would be welcomed by both the Palace and opposition
                                elements as grounds for attack against <persName corresp="#p_C1"
                                    >Caramanlis</persName>, the U.S. should refrain from such steps.
                                We should, however, continue our current programs in Greece and
                                proceed with the delivery of the projected aide-memoire, which will
                                signify the continuity of our policy of cooperation and our interest
                                in the welfare of Greece.</item>

                                as well as to the benefit of U.S. interests in Greece, that
                                elections be held by about October. Through an unfortunate

                                indefinite postponement of elections, the currently favorable
                                outlook might be reduced. Under such circumstances, we will consider
                                what United States actions might be necessary and possible to
                                increase the chances for an outcome compatible with our basic

                                    <gloss target="#t_EDA1">EDA</gloss>, of course, will oppose the
                                government at every turn and will try to secure <pb n="677"
                                    xml:id="pg_677" facs="0699"/>the cooperation of the
                                non-Communist Center Union in some of its anti-government
                                activities. The Palace probably will attempt to intervene more
                                directly in governmental affairs in an effort to weaken <persName
                                    corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName>’ position. The Center
                                Union is likely to continue its attempts to harass the government,
                                though it will be wary of joint action with <gloss target="#t_EDA1"
                                    >EDA</gloss>. The Center Union probably will devote much of its
                                energies toward securing a favorable electoral law and ensuring that
                                the election is a “fair” one, threatening to continue its struggle
                                of the past two years if its demands are not met. Pipinelis has
                                already met some of the Center Union’s demands—such as equal radio
                                time—and probably will attempt to work out acceptable compromises on
                                other issues. Despite the pressures from all sides and his desire to
                                compromise, Pipinelis is dependent on the support of <persName

                                    >ERE</gloss>, and is unlikely to take any steps that would
                                seriously weaken <persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> or
                                the <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss>. It now appears that the
                                    <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> will retain its cohesion.
                                Pipinelis will strive to push through an electoral law and complete
                                the formation of the electoral rolls in time for an election within
                                the next few months.</item>

                            <item>The outcome of the coming election is likely to depend to a
                                considerable extent on the type of electoral law adopted. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> and many members of the
                                    <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> favor the majority system,
                                and several years ago <persName corresp="#p_C1"
                                    >Caramanlis</persName> forced such an electoral law through
                                Parliament. However, the Center Union, <gloss target="#t_EDA1"
                                    >EDA</gloss>, and some elements of <gloss target="#t_ERE1"
                                    >ERE</gloss> are opposed to such a system. So are many sections
                                of the public, who fear that it would drive the Center Union and
                                    <gloss target="#t_EDA1">EDA</gloss> into an electoral alliance,
                                and create new bitterness between the government and the opposition.
                                While the opposition parties and probably the Palace favor a
                                relatively straight proportional representation system as one most
                                likely to reduce <persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName>’
                                strength, the <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> is strongly
                                opposed. The most likely outcome of the struggle, after considerable
                                political maneuvering, is the adoption of a reinforced proportional
                                representation system—such as was used for the last election—which
                                would benefit the <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> and the Center
                                Union, so long as the <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> and the
                                Center Union maintain party discipline.</item>

                            <item>The timing of the election will also have a bearing on its
                                outcome. <persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> appears to
                                have strengthened his popular appeal by resigning over his dispute
                                with the Palace. As time passes, however, this issue may be
                                superseded by other issues less favorable to <persName
                                    corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> and <gloss
                                    target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss>. The now electoral rolls now under
                                preparation apparently cannot be completed much before October or
                                November. The Pipinelis government could attempt to rush the
                                election by taking short-cuts in preparing the rolls, but such a
                                maneuver probably would spark accusations that the government was
                                rigging the elections in favor of <gloss target="#t_ERE1"
                                    >ERE</gloss>, and seems unlikely to be attempted. A more serious
                                danger is that the Palace, fearing that <persName corresp="#p_C1"
                                    >Caramanlis</persName> might curb the royal family, might
                                undertake <pb n="678" xml:id="pg_678" facs="0700"/>desperate
                                political moves to postpone elections in the hope of somehow
                                preventing his return to power. For example, it might seek the
                                cooperation of opposition leaders and perhaps some disgruntled
                                    <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> elements to form an openly
                                political government. However, it is likely that the <gloss
                                    target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> will remain united and the
                                government will carry out electoral preparations thoroughly and as
                                speedily as possible, and probably will be able to hold elections
                                sometime during the fall.</item>

                                elections held under such conditions. After many years in power
                                    <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> is relatively well-organized
                                throughout the country, while the Center Union’s organization is
                                weak in most rural areas. Greece has had seven years of stability
                                and progress under <persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName>,
                                and there is widespread confidence that such progress will continue.
                                Satisfactory crops in most parts of the country, expanding
                                industrial activity, and a booming tourist business are elements of
                                strength for the government. These factors are somewhat offset by
                                the solid core of support possessed by both the Center Union and
                                    <gloss target="#t_EDA1">EDA</gloss> and by the feeling of many
                                Greeks that <persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> and
                                    <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> have been in office too
                                long. However, it seems unlikely that these considerations will be
                                enough to overcome <persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName>’
                                assets, and he is likely to be returned to office with at least a
                                working majority. No basic change in the Parliamentary strength of

                            <item>Such an electoral outcome would result in a further period of
                                political stability and economic progress in Greece, as well as a
                                continuation of Greece’s present foreign policy. The need to compete
                                with the other parties in promising greater welfare benefits might
                                create some fiscal problems for a new <persName corresp="#p_C1"
                                    >Caramanlis</persName> government. If relations with Greece’s
                                neighbors become a prominent campaign issue, it could limit the
                                flexibility of a new government in dealing with some perennial

                            <item>If for any reason—a long-delayed election, changing popular

                                be substantially reduced. Even if the Center Union obtained a
                                majority, conflicts within the leadership, the lack of cohesion in
                                its components, and lack of a clear policy, would result in at least
                                a modest decline in stability. However, it seems quite unlikely that
                                the Center Union could secure a majority itself. A more likely
                                result would be the failure of any party to win a majority of seats,
                                with the consequent need for a <pb n="679" xml:id="pg_679"

                            underscore the U.S. view, that, above the present level of defense
                            effort, <pb n="680" xml:id="pg_680" facs="0702"/>Greece should give top
                            priority to an intensified development effort. As I told Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PP1">Papaligouras</persName>, “we don’t want to push
                            Greek military expenditures to the point where they take away from
                            economic development.”</p>
                        <p>Because U.S. representatives in the past have spoken with conflicting
                            voices, I wish steps taken to insure that all concerned, including our
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military people, are aware of
                            and actively support the position in the Aide-memoire with respect to
                            Greek defense budgets.</p>

                                <item>In delivering the aide-memoire we wish again to emphasize the
                                    continuing U.S. interest in the security, stability and progress
                                    of Greece.</item>

                                    defense effort are formed in the light of the probable

                                    economy. We regard these matters as interdependent. Military
                                    security provides the confidence and stability needed for
                                    economic growth; increased economic strength and well-being
                                    should provide the basis for an adequate defense effort. The
                                    foundation of Greek security, like that of the other <gloss
                                        target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries, rests on the

                                <item>U.S. aid programs regarding Greece reflect our belief in
                                    Greece’s growing ability to sustain a satisfactory rate of
                                    economic growth. At this stage we regard Greece’s own efforts as
                                    the essential ingredient, with inflows of foreign capital being
                                    attracted by Greece’s successes in the economic field rather
                                    than, as in the past, Greece’s economy being impelled toward
                                    growth by foreign assistance. We therefore reiterate our view
                                    that the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> should continue to
                                    press ahead wherever possible at this time in its economic

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Matsas</persName> read the aide-memoire,
                            expressed the thanks of his Government, and pointed out that, since the
                            aide-memoire is a long and complicated document, he could not comment on
                            it except to note in passing the fact that the U.S. proposed to
                            contribute $5 million in 1964 toward the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> Working Group exercise for Greek Defense, rather than
                            $10 million, as had been the case in 1963. He also noted the phased
                            reduction of commercial consumables under <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                                >MAP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> remarked
                            that the state of U.S.-Greek relations marked by the aide-memoire showed
                            the remarkable progress made by Greece since 1947, and even since 1953.
                            He reiterated his previously expressed view that the U.S. wished to
                            continue on a “business-as-usual” basis with regard to Greece, despite
                            the present pre-election situation.</p>

                            and the repeated election law violations during the 1961 campaign

                            on September 28 and announced that the King would call new elections for
                            November 3.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Stikker</persName> commented that as a
                            result of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> resolution to assist
                            the Greeks to finance their inordinately high defense budget, he had
                            agreed to act as the collection agent for them. In spite of the need
                            which he personally believes justified, it has not been an easy job. For
                            example, in Athens where he recently met with the Greeks, he had
                            experienced a rather difficult time. He found the Greeks to be
                            ungrateful regarding his efforts to obtain 1963 assistance and full of
                            complaints. The Greek attitude was annoying, but he had tried to control
                            his temper. In the Secretary General’s experience, the Greeks have not
                            taken the initiative expected of them. They have failed to follow
                            through to negotiate out the various pledges; their efforts have not
                            been well-coordinated; and they have not been very cooperative.</p>
                        <p>In spite of these difficulties, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SD1"
                                >Stikker</persName> stated he is hopeful the Greeks will raise their
                            self-financed Greek budget, which was $154 million in 1962 and was
                            raised to $161 million in 1963, to $170 million in 1964. Of course, this
                            event is predicated on the assumption the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> exercise will come up with approximately the same
                            amount as pledged in 1963. The Greeks calculated their over-all defense
                            requirement in 1964 to be $213 million, leaving a $43 million gap. The
                            Secretary General told them this was too high and they came down to $30
                            million; however, he believed they would be satisfied with approximately
                            last year’s <pb n="683" xml:id="pg_683" facs="0705"/>level. Perhaps, if
                            the Greeks settle their pre-war debt with the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >U.K.</gloss>, the latter might contribute. If the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> participates, France may also, although
                            the French have a tendency to consider Greece and Turkey as United
                            States preserves.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Stikker</persName> referred to his
                            conversation with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                >McNamara</persName><note n="1" xml:id="d354fn1">A copy of the
                                memorandum of conversation is ibid.</note> and said that he had
                            hoped the United States would contribute $10 million to the 1964
                            exercise, as it has done in 1963. However, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had stated that the United
                            States could not contribute more than $5 million because of our
                            worldwide commitments. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Stikker</persName>
                            pointed out that our cut would make his job exceedingly difficult. He
                            agreed to use the totality of our aid to Greek defense, which he knew
                            was significant, as an argument to buttress the United States
                            contribution (his aide then reviewed the projected <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> figure for FY1964 which was: $5 million
                            for the defense exercise, a programmed <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                                >MAP</gloss> figure of $80 million, and expected deliveries
                            amounting to $150–$180 million). Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SD1"
                                >Stikker</persName> reiterated that he considered it important to
                            assist the Greeks, even though their economic progress has been
                            impressive. He commented that the Bank of Greece estimated the 1963
                            increase in <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> to be 9%, which,
                            combined with the 1962 rate of about 4%, averaged out at about 6%.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_BK2">Bracken</persName> agreed that while
                            there is a lack of coordination in the <gloss target="#t_GOG1"
                                >GOG</gloss>, that perhaps the technique of the Greeks submitting a
                            shopping list to the members might be helpful. The Secretary General
                            remarked the Greeks have resisted this approach because of their desire
                            to translate these contributions into drachmae for the defense budget.
                            It was also mentioned that the consumable portion which is purchased
                            abroad for the Greek defense budget is a small component of the over-all
                            defense budget and the Greeks would probably prefer to purchase these
                            items from traditional suppliers. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SD1"
                                >Stikker</persName> admitted that he had found it difficult to
                            obtain an accurate figure on the “gap”. He emphasized the importance of
                            the United States coordinating its projected amounts of military
                            assistance with him because this information is necessary when
                            discussing the problem with other prospective donors. They insist upon
                            knowing what the United States is planning to do. We indicated the
                            impossibility of projecting possible future long-range U.S. aid to
                            Greece in view of current congressional attitudes.</p>
                        <p>A general discussion of Greek military planning ensued and it was
                            generally agreed that the Greeks would attempt to utilize the planning
                            exercise as a way to obtain aid.</p>

                        <p>Greek national elections held November 3 resulted in a victory for the
                            Center Union. The party emerged with 42 percent of the vote and 138
                            seats in Parliament. <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> won 39 percent

                        <p>The President welcomed the Queen, recalling his long and friendly
                            association with Greece. He reminded her that he had been the first
                            member of Congress to speak in favor of the Truman Doctrine. She
                            responded that she remembered that well, and that American actions had
                            saved Greece. The President referred to Greece as a brave country and
                            staunch ally, with whom we stand firmly.</p>

                            Greece, she said it was going to be all right. The “present crowd” (the
                            new Government) were a little nervous, because they had attacked “us”
                            (presumably the Royal Family) while they were out of office. But they
                                <pb n="685" xml:id="pg_685" facs="0707"/>were learning that they
                            could work with “us” and she did not foresee any great trouble. She
                            wanted President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and the
                            United States to know as a certainty that so long as her husband was

                            was true, and that we are proud of our friendship with Greece.</p>

                        <p>The Deputy Prime Minister expressed the deep grief of the Greek people at
                            the tragedy which had overtaken America. The Secretary responded with
                            appreciation to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VS1">Venizelos</persName> for
                            having come at this time of great grief here. He was also glad to have
                            this chance to talk with him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VS1">Venizelos</persName> expressed his desire
                            to speak briefly about both internal and external aspects of Greek
                            policies. His party for 11 years had been in opposition before forming
                            the present Government. This Government differed from <persName
                                corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName>’ Government in that while both
                            opposed the Communists, the previous Government had depended on police
                            measures, whereas this Government intended to use the more efficient
                            measures of social action. The Secretary might remember that this party
                            had fought Communists effectively in the past. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VS1">Venizelos</persName> himself had been appointed
                            Prime Minister specifically for the purpose of fighting Communist
                            efforts to take over the country. After the liberation he had taken part
                            in all efforts to fight the Communists and other Ministers in the
                            present Cabinet had done the same. It was worth noting <pb n="686"
                                xml:id="pg_686" facs="0708"/>that in the 1961 elections the <gloss

                                corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> through repressive measures,
                            whereas in the 1963 elections they came out with less support even
                            though repressive measures were not used. If the present Government
                            should remain in power long enough it would hope to limit the <gloss

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said we understood
                            what the new Government was seeking to achieve. We hoped we could be
                            helpful to Greece in meeting its problems, but we were not interested in
                            being too large an influence in Greece, nor for that matter in Turkey.
                            The right balance was the question. It was important to consult on the
                            security problems facing Greece, and on its relations with its immediate
                            neighbors. At one stage it had seemed that our estimate of the threat
                            from Bulgaria, for example, was somewhat different from the Greek
                            estimate. We were not interested in an arms race if some way could be
                            found to limit it.</p>
                        <p>Deputy Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_VS1">Venizelos</persName>
                            recalled that he had headed a Greek delegation to the United States in
                            1946 which had led to the Porter Mission, from which had come the great
                            cooperation between Greece and the United States. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> responded that these broad policies
                            of the West in the post-war period were developed by different parties
                            at different times. We spoke of a bipartisan policy in this country. It
                            was interesting to recall that it was the Labor Party of Britain that
                            helped form <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The most elemental
                            problems are national in character, rather than partisan. Thus we could
                            see no difficulty in continuing our cooperation with Greece through one
                            party or another.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VS1">Venizelos</persName> observed that all
                            members of the present Cabinet in Greece are pro-West in orientation and
                            great friends of the United States. It was under a government he himself
                            had headed that Greece joined <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He
                            wanted the Secretary to know that Greece is absolutely determined to
                            maintain its commitments.</p>
                        <p>The only external question on which the present government would differ
                            with the <persName corresp="#p_C1">Caramanlis</persName> government, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VS1">Venizelos</persName> went on, was Cyprus.
                            In order for Cyprus to live on it would be essential to make some
                            changes in the Constitution. He was glad to be able to report that the
                            British understood this well. Here in Washington, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VS1">Venizelos</persName> had called on Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> and Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> of Turkey. They would
                            meet again at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting, and he
                            hoped the Ministers of the three guarantor powers would also meet in
                            Paris to discuss the Cyprus matter.</p>
                        <p>The great concern would be to eliminate from the Cyprus Constitution
                            those parts that caused great friction between the communities in Cyprus
                            and thus between Greece and Turkey, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VS1"
                                >Venizelos</persName> said. He wanted the Secretary to understand
                            that this had nothing to do with any step toward enosis, i.e., union
                            with Greece. Its sole purpose was to eliminate <pb n="687"
                                xml:id="pg_687" facs="0709"/>those dangerous frictions. Contrary to
                            the stories of desire to prepare Cyprus for union with Greece, the
                            proposals were intended to make Cyprus livable for its own people. His
                            Government would be content to see not Cyprus as part of Greece but a
                            second Greece in Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said we in the
                            United States had no specific formula to suggest for Cyprus. Our great
                            interest was in good relations between Greece and Turkey and in a stable
                            situation in Cyprus. He would hope the Greeks would be in close touch
                            with their colleagues in Turkey and with the guarantor powers. The
                            situation had considerable delicacy, of course. The United States could
                            be glad to keep in touch with the thinking of the Greek Government, but
                            he doubted that we should take any initiative ourselves.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VS1">Venizelos</persName> said the Greek
                            Government would be grateful to the United States if it would contribute
                            to finding the solutions necessary so that Cyprus could go ahead as an
                            independent state. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                                >Matsas</persName> added that the Greek Government would be thankful
                            if, when the amendment question was raised, the United States would view
                            the problem with sympathy and understanding, as did the United
                            Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VS1">Venizelos</persName> commented further
                            that the present situation, involving for example a Turkish veto, made
                            the situation very difficult. He could say that <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Archbishop Makarios</persName> was ready to make
                            concessions beyond the Constitution, as for example by agreeing that the
                            Vice President rather than the (Greek) Speaker of the House should act
                            in his stead when the President was absent from the country. This was
                            still a confidential matter, but it indicated his intention and showed
                            that the <persName corresp="#p_MIIIA1">Archbishop</persName> envisaged
                            the issue as a question of negotiation to amend certain articles of the
                            Constitution while at the same time making serious concessions.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> responded that we
                            would hope this should be acknowledged as a problem in the first
                            instance for the guarantor powers. He hoped that anything done would be
                            accomplished by negotiation and agreement.</p>
                        <p>Turning to another subject, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VS1"
                                >Venizelos</persName> said that his Government was putting greater
                            emphasis on the internal situation. It did not fear isolated attack from
                            its neighbors, for example, Bulgaria. Thus, it was mainly interested in
                            the domestic health of the country, and especially the condition of the
                            peasants who were its backbone.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked about the
                            Minister of Defense. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VS1">Venizelos</persName>
                            explained that the present Minister was a military man who had been a
                            member of the caretaker government, kept on at the request of the King.
                            He indicated that a new Minister would be chosen after the vote of
                            confidence in the Parliament.</p>
                        <pb n="688" xml:id="pg_688" facs="0710"/>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that his Government had no intention of cutting
                            its military expenditures in a unilateral way. It recognized that this
                            could only be done in consultation with <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                            expressed himself as very glad to hear this. We had pledged ourselves to
                            each other, and needed to consult closely. We might have talks in <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and discuss the situation in, say,
                            Bulgaria as we both saw it. If at times we had different estimates, it
                            was particularly important that we consult.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VS1">Venizelos</persName> referred to a
                            complaint of the Soviet Ambassador about recent <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> exercises. He indicated that the Soviets had not
                            gotten much comfort from his response.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName corresp="#p_TRL1"
                            >Ray</persName></hi>: There are a few angles of the recent Turkish
                            request for additional military budget support, not explicitly mentioned
                            in the wires, which we thought might interest you and General <persName
                                corresp="#p_NLGL1">Norstad</persName>. One is that the request was
                            made completely outside normal channels. Colonel
                                <persName>Tunckanat</persName> of the Committee of National Unity
                            (which has been the Turkish Government, above the Cabinet), assisted by
                            some military officers, presented the Turkish request. The ministers who
                            normally deal in budgetary matters played a silent role and in some
                            cases made known their opposition. As you know, the highly competent
                            Finance Minister, <persName corresp="#p_AE1">Alican</persName>, resigned
                            because the Committee insisted on carrying through the pay raise and
                            other benefits for the military which threatened his budget and the
                            government’s financial stability. General Alankus, former General of the
                            Ground Forces and new Minister of Defense, has told Embassy staff
                            members that he opposed very strongly the request for additional aid at
                            this time.</p>
                        <p>A second interesting point is the divergence in Turkish presentations of
                            their own intentions. According to your wires 28 and 31<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d358fn1">Telegram 28 from Paris to Ankara, December 14,

                                >Sunay</persName> in his conversation with General <persName

                            are in consonance with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> planning.
                            He has reiterated these levels in a subsequent conversation with General
                            Morin. In Colonel <persName>Tunckanat</persName>’s briefings (<gloss

                            reduce the level of its forces by 35–40%, which would mean a reduction
                            in army personnel to a point far below that mentioned by General
                                <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Sunay</persName> and very drastic
                            reductions for the Air Force and Navy as well.</p>
                        <pb n="690" xml:id="pg_690" facs="0712"/>
                        <p>Although we do not know what the outcome will actually be, certain
                            factors will undoubtedly be taken into account in arriving at a
                            decision. One is, if the military budget finally comes out at the 1.788
                            billion TL, as proposed by the Minister of Finance, and if this limited
                            budget must absorb a large pay increase and other benefits for military
                            personnel, substantial reductions in force levels will have to be made.
                            We cannot estimate at this juncture whether or not under these
                            conditions it would be possible for the Turks to support the level of
                            forces which General <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Sunay</persName>
                            indicated.</p>
                        <p>Although General <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Sunay</persName> is in a
                            most influential position as Chief of Staff, his is by no means the only
                            voice which must be heard in arriving at a decision on the military
                            budget. The Committee of National Unity, as mentioned above, has been
                            the Government of Turkey in this revolutionary period, and its decisions
                            on funds and force levels, which would presumably be determining, cannot
                            be ignored by General <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Sunay</persName>.
                            After we informed him of the adverse U.S. decision on his request for
                            additional aid, Colonel <persName>Tunckanat</persName> of the Committee
                            told us that the Government would proceed on the basis of the smaller
                            budget involving reduced force levels. It will be most interesting to
                            see how this squares with General <persName corresp="#p_SGC1"
                                >Sunay</persName>’s projected levels.</p>
                        <p>A complicating factor is the inauguration of the Constituent Assembly.
                            Review of the budget is one of the specified powers of this body. Hence
                            while we may know about the proposed budget soon, it is unlikely that we
                            will know the final figure until Assembly action has been concluded, a
                            process which could take some weeks. Although the Committee’s power will
                            be less now that it constitutes only the upper house of this new
                            organization, it still retains an ultimate veto power since an average
                            of 51% of the vote of the two houses (voting separately and weighted
                            equally) is required to reach a decision when there is a difference
                            between them.</p>
                        <p>We have one question about your wire No. 31 to Ankara. In paragraph one
                            it is stated that General <persName corresp="#p_NLGL1"
                                >Norstad</persName> sees no need for the Turks to pursue discussion
                            of their aid request with the Embassy in light of the procedure to be
                            followed involving General <persName corresp="#p_SGC1"
                            >Sunay</persName>’s memorandum as to the breakdown of forces and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_NLGL1">Norstad</persName>’s prospective
                            recommendation thereon. We are pleased that the Turkish problem is now
                            in the hands of the competent <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            authorities which is in keeping with our own recommendations (<gloss
                                target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss> 789). However, since we delivered
                            the Department’s reply to the Turkish request for aid, which was a
                            fairly categorical “no”, it appears to us that the main discussion is
                            over and there is nothing left to pursue.</p>
                        <p>There remains, I suppose, the possibility that General <persName
                                corresp="#p_NLGL1">Norstad</persName> might himself wish to effect a
                            change in the U.S. Government’s negative position when he has studied
                            General <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Sunay</persName>’s program. This
                            would resemble <pb n="691" xml:id="pg_691" facs="0713"/>somewhat the
                            process which occurred in connection with the Turkish request for $12
                            million of “additional” aid last August. Leaving aside the question of
                            the merits of additional aid, we can see some difficulties for you in
                            this process. The Turks may get the notion that an approach to <gloss
                                target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> is the most profitable means of
                            obtaining aid which is otherwise difficult or impossible to secure. The
                            Turkish Government can allocate its existing resources, including
                            counterpart, to cover any budgetary requirement it wishes, leaving
                            others uncovered. The present budget, for instance, apparently includes
                            increased appropriations for health and education to be met out of
                            existing resources. This is one reason why the military are receiving
                            less in the approved budget, leaving their needs partially uncovered.
                            Since the Turkish Government can thus control to a large degree the
                            sectors of their budget for which external aid must be sought, it may
                            not be entirely a matter of chance that it is the military sector which
                            has been selected on this occasion.</p>
                        <p>By the way, we note from your wire No. 28 to Ankara that General
                                <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Sunay</persName> mentioned our letter of
                            November 12, on the Turkish budget process. As you will have guessed, it
                            offered no encouragement regarding increased aid, as he claimed, but it
                            did make major recommendations for a more orderly budget making process.
                            I am enclosing a copy as of possible interest to you.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d358fn3">The letter was not found. In telegram 965 from

                                to Parliament by the Turkish Government included a significant
                                increase in defense expenditures financed by new taxes and a
                                reduction in military manpower. The Embassy cautioned, however, that
                                the Turkish Government might resurrect its request for substantial

                            express some personal views. Yassiada trials and final verdict were of
                            course internal matter and so regarded by us. Nevertheless it was
                            internal matter which under certain circumstances could lap over into
                            foreign field and produce strong reactions. In my judgment American
                            people ready accept “adjusted” solution but not “ultimate” (death
                            sentence) decision. Latter could in my opinion very seriously damage
                            image of Turkey which Americans had formed, which would be most
                            unfoertunate. Additionally could not but place <gloss target="#t_USG1"

                                    strategic weapons whose vulnerability makes them useful only for
                                    “strike first” purposes in country on Soviet border—especially
                                    since eventual Turkish manning contemplated. Question raised
                                    whether (failing foolproof physical safeguards to maintain US
                                    control after Turkish manning) such deployment might increase
                                    risk of war by miscalculation, either (i) because of firing by
                                    Turks of weapons in case of local “incident”, when US would not
                                    want them fired, or (ii) because Soviets (fearing Turks’ firing)
                                    might feel compelled to attack and destroy weapons pre-emptively
                                    in case of grave international crisis.</p>

                            <item>You know my views on the need for mid-range ballistic missiles in
                                Allied Command Europe. The critical shortage of missile-delivery
                                systems, which it was anticipated would continue up into 1963 to
                                1965, was an added factor when the Jupiter program was established.
                                This was considered important militarily, but was perhaps of even
                                greater significance from a psychological or political standpoint.
                                In both these respects, I believe the program continues to be of
                                value.</item>

                            <item>The Polaris submarine is clearly a superior weapons system, but I
                                am impressed with the fact that these weapons will be in short
                                supply for a number of years. The question therefore is not whether
                                a Polaris submarine in Eastern Mediterranean will be better than a
                                Jupiter squadron; rather, it is whether submarine plus squadron
                                gives us greater strength than submarine alone. I believe that it
                                does. If this question of quality is introduced, I hope thought will
                                be given to the effect talk of obsolescence would have on the
                                British Thor and Italian Jupiter positions.</item>

                                considerable extent and for considerable time. In fact, the present
                                program provides <pb n="699" xml:id="pg_699" facs="0721"/>for almost
                                complete U.S. manning until Jan 1964 and very probably this will
                                have to be extended. Thus we could easily make a virtue of this
                                necessity and continue substantial U.S. manning for the useful life
                                of the Jupiter squadron. I do not believe, therefore, that the
                                control problem referred to in the cited message is a valid
                                concern.</item>

                            <item>From figures available here, about 80 percent of this project’s
                                cost through FY 63 has been spent or is committed, and thus is not
                                recoverable. It appears that much of the remaining 20 percent
                                (maintenance, operations, etc.) would have to be spent on the same
                                general items if another system replaced the Jupiter. All in all the
                                savings over two years would be relatively small and would not make
                                an impressive contribution if applied to other Turkish Armed Forces

                                        billion in military assistance, he thought it would be

                                        assistance in 1962 as in 1961. It was certainly unrealistic

                                    use conventional or atomic forces to assist Turkey? <persName

                                <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> thought that the Vienna

                                corresp="#p_NLGL1">Norstad</persName> agreed and said that it had
                            been the same need for demonstrating increased allied nuclear power, in
                            the context of the “missile gap,” that had prompted the <gloss
                                target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> program for Europe, including those
                            for Turkey, in the first instance.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether General <persName corresp="#p_NLGL1"
                                >Norstad</persName> had any doubts regarding the ability of the U.S.
                            to control the use of the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>’s in
                            Turkey. General <persName corresp="#p_NLGL1">Norstad</persName> said he
                            had none whatever. He affirmed that it would be impossible for the Turks
                            to take over the entire system during the life expectancy of these
                            weapons and said that it should also be possible to develop a more
                            effective two-key system. The Secretary thought that the main factor in
                            this regard was not the two-key arrangement but whether or not the Turks
                            could obtain the necessary know-how for operation of the entire weapon
                            system. He said the Turks were greatly concerned <pb n="703"
                                xml:id="pg_703" facs="0725"/>about their possible isolation in the
                            face of Soviet aggression and thought they might therefore be tempted in
                            an emergency to take over the U.S. key by force. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_NLGL1">Norstad</persName> said that the <gloss
                                target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> program could be handled in such a
                            manner as to ensure that the Turks would not obtain operational
                            knowledge of the entire system during its effective life. He agreed with
                            the Secretary’s observation about the Turkish fear of isolation and said
                            that both the Greeks and Turks have this concern. They regard the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> strategic concept of “local hostile
                            action, infiltration or incursion” as a rationalization which the major
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> powers might use to avoid a
                            nuclear response to Soviet action against the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> flanks. General <persName corresp="#p_NLGL1"
                                >Norstad</persName> said that he did not know quite why the Greeks
                            and Turks felt this way but that he had been careful to reassure them
                            and thought he had been successful.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary concluded that there was a consensus that the <gloss
                                target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> program should not be held up or
                            cancelled and asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> to

                        <p>A referendum on a new Constitution for the Turkish Republic was held on
                            July 9. The referendum marked a major step toward the return to a system
                            of civilian responsibility for government. However, the process of
                            constitutional restoration was marked by evidence that many military
                            officers opposed a return to party government and by signs of civilian
                            discontent with the role that the military had assigned itself in the
                            new constitutional order. The Embassy reported on these tensions in
                            telegram 1156, March 29 (Department of State, Central Files,
                            782.00/3–2961) and telegram C–324, June 9 (ibid., 782.5/6–961). The
                            restoration of civilian rule in Turkey began on January 12, when the
                            military government authorized the formation of new political parties.
                            The government permitted the parties to resume activity on April 1. On
                            May 27, the Constituent Assembly approved a draft Constitution and
                            decreed that national elections to approve a new Constitution would be
                            held on July 9.</p>
                        <p>The elections resulted in the approval of the new Constitution by
                            approximately 62 percent of those voting. On July 21, the Constituent
                            Assembly agreed to hold parliamentary elections on October 15.</p>

                            matter is now one where “job can only be done here” and he believed

                            easily be regarded as threat. He also wished assure that Secretary’s

                                    certain principles. As long as this unity of purpose continues,
                                    it will be exceedingly difficult to organize effective

                                    While military and civilians might well disagree on role
                                    military to play after elections, there is agreement on basic
                                    objective. Therefore any move toward coup would have to run
                                    against current of popular sentiment. While many people are
                                    concerned about outcome of trials and elections, base for

                                    junior officers in army. Their restlessness apparently still
                                    takes form of criticizing democrats for present ills, belief
                                    trials dragged on too long without needed punishment, desire see
                                    more reforms before government returned to corrupt politicians.
                                    It is our belief this group is unorganized and not one and same
                                    with <persName corresp="#p_TCA1">Turkes</persName> supporters,

                            </list></p>
                        <p>On balance we conclude that successful coup by <persName
                                corresp="#p_TCA1">Turkes</persName> in relatively near future
                            unlikely. Different hypothetical outcome of trials and elections would
                            not alter this conclusion. On other hand, if political scene
                            deteriorates seriously after the elections, <persName corresp="#p_TCA1"
                                >Turkes</persName> and his supporters would be able to improve
                            considerably their position within armed forces and hence chances for
                            successful coup. Question then might be one of timing. If established
                            military moved first to reassume control of government, chances of coup
                            by <persName corresp="#p_TCA1">Turkes</persName> against military would
                            be small. But if military allowed things to rock along with civilian
                            government making demonstration of its inability to cope with problems
                            of government, opportunity for successful move on part of younger
                            officers would be enhanced.</p>
                        <p>Foregoing observations directed primarily to answering Department
                            telegram 212. Fact that our present reading of situation is such as to
                            indicate that coup not logical product should not be interpreted as
                            indicating that we regard present situation including both military and
                            civilian aspects as something about which one can feel relaxed. In
                            addition dissatisfaction of junior officers noted above there is
                            tenseness between political parties and certain air of expectancy among
                            people. If disturbances occur as result trials there is always question
                            in current atmosphere whether ordinary soldier would participate
                            wholeheartedly in repressing civilian unrest even if there were no
                            particular problem at officer level. Hopefully army will, as they
                            repeatedly assert they can, keep situation under control. There is also
                            possibility public reaction may not be as strong as some fear.</p>
                        <p>In sum we seem to be going into situation where another coup in immediate
                            future does not appear in cards for concern. Turkey will face several
                            moments of truth in next few months and how people and government forces
                            react to each could have determining influence on future course
                            events.</p>

                            Finance Kurdas and Minister Justice Turkoglu had expressed views on
                            behalf Cabinet as quite strongly advising that possible death penalties
                            should not be carried out. <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Sarper</persName>
                            said, in addition to Cabinet, <persName corresp="#p_GC1"
                                >Gursel</persName> and all armed forces commanders shared this view.
                            As regards <gloss target="#t_CNU1">CNU</gloss>, committee was divided
                                <pb n="710" xml:id="pg_710" facs="0732"/>with “seeming majority on

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SS1">Sarper</persName> added that present situation
                            is turning point in Turkey’s history and both sides fully aware of that.
                            Problem is that on one side is reason and experience and on other
                            rashness and disposition resort to brute force.</p>

                            said <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> had apparently kept
                            supply sleeping pills for occasion and had taken overdose but that
                            efforts now being made revive him. <persName corresp="#p_SS1"
                                >Sarper</persName> commented it was indeed ironic to be making such
                            effort to save his life merely to be able to hang him.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SS1">Sarper</persName> also noted that there had
                            been irresponsible rumors that attempts might be made against his life
                            and lives of other Ministers supporting cause of clemency but Cabinet
                            members had not been impressed and were sticking to their positions.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Sarper</persName> requested that
                            this frank discussion be held very closely since any leak could be quite

                            US, with military subordinate to duly elected civil authority. At same

                            future of Turkish people as they see it. As consequence most Turks
                            initially welcomed May 27 coup as bloodlessly ending period of great
                            strain and potential strife. Developments since, however, have in
                            general alienated civil elements, who have come to desire end of
                            military and return to civil rule.</p>
                        <p>Military forces themselves are by no means united on political goals.
                            There are those, probably encompassing present top commanders, who
                            desire return to civilian government but with military holding watching
                            brief on conduct that government. There is also group younger officers
                            who are disenchanted with politicians, have never favored return to
                            civil government. This group, probably unorganized in any formal sense,
                            may include elements which per se favor military dictatorship and those
                            which simply believe there remains basic job of reform and education
                            before government can again be entrusted to civilians. Difficult
                            specifically delineate these groups and reports regarding them vary
                            widely [<hi rend="italic">1–1/2 lines of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] identifying individual officers representing
                            various schools of thought within military.</p>
                        <p>Among parties military as whole and <gloss target="#t_CNU1">CNU</gloss>
                            favored RPP since that party shared enmity for DP regime. As one major
                            party surviving May 27, RPP went along with coup and subsequent military
                            government, but determiners this policy always viewed it as best
                            approach in terms national welfare and one most likely get military out
                            of government. RPP therefore prepared accept <gloss target="#t_CNU1"
                                >CNU</gloss> reforms, refrain from any punitive measures. As such it
                            became party most acceptable to <gloss target="#t_CNU1">CNU</gloss> and
                            military. While many military officers and some <gloss target="#t_CNU1"
                                >CNU</gloss> emotionally prejudiced in favor of RPP, area of support
                            party recently won in these circles based far more on feeling party was
                            safe, would preserve reforms on which military insist. This is not
                            because RPP has been tool of military but because party leaders consider
                            this course best means of gaining power and ultimately reestablishing
                            proper balance between military and civil authority.</p>
                        <p>Justice Party is something quite different. Original impetus for its
                            formation came from retired officers who hated <gloss target="#t_CNU1"
                                >CNU</gloss> because these officers were retired and took to
                            political forum in hope reversing August 1960 purge of military.
                            Furthermore and even more importantly as party, JP has successfully
                            appealed to voters in wide areas of country as logical successor to
                            former Democrat Party, whose members primarily interested in rectifying
                            wrong of May 27 and some of whom desire avenge execution their leader.
                            Party if it came to power would therefore offer little physical security
                            for former <gloss target="#t_CNU1">CNU</gloss> members, little support
                            for so-called reforms <gloss target="#t_CNU1">CNU</gloss> considered
                            important.</p>

                        <p>If RPP had won majority, transition to civil rule would probably have
                            taken place without incident. Fact that elements basically opposed to
                            regime of last seventeen months won majority maximized fears that reform
                            may be reformed and even Yassiada repeated with new cast. Fact that no
                            group won majority and future involves uneasy coalition strengthened
                            elements in military which oppose return to civil rule, argue that
                            average Turk voter not ready for democratic government. Military leaders
                            (meaning leaders regular military establishment and not <gloss

                            within military over danger of hostile corrupt civilian politicians
                            coming to power, it is but a temporary palliative and not solution and
                            basic conflict between military and parties will remain of continuing
                            concern.</p>

                                and this required world-wide readjustments. The Turkish program is
                                now the largest grant aid program in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                    >NATO</gloss>. The US is, of course, not able to meet all the

                                custodial sites in accordance with US law so that nuclear weapons
                                can be prepositioned for use by the Turkish Air Force. General
                                Lemnitzer made it clear that while these weapons were now available,
                                they would not be delivered to US storage sites in Turkey until the
                                communications problem was solved.</item>

                            <item>General <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Sunay</persName> stated that
                                Turkey does not object to the US having custody of the radar and
                                signal sites and to the US operation of them. They feel, however,
                                that their own personnel should have access to these sites and to
                                receive training in operating them. A second point concerned area
                                acquisition. The US had contacted and made certain agreements with
                                local people without the knowledge of the Turkish General Staff.
                                Later the Turkish General Staff was requested to pay for the
                                acquisition of land and in this way became aware of the problem.

                                stated he felt it would be unwise to delay this long and suggested a
                                date as early as 24 November 1961 which was agreed upon as
                                acceptable to Turkey. He suggested that General Enginsoy during his
                                contacts with US staff could identify issues and work out solutions
                                where possible. If any problems remain, they could be discussed
                                between General <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Sunay</persName> and

                            <item>General Lemnitzer summed up by stating that there was action
                                required by both General <persName corresp="#p_SGC1"
                                    >Sunay</persName> and himself. General Lemnitzer stated he would
                                make arrangements with Admiral <persName>Smith</persName> of the
                                Joint Staff for Brigadier General Enginsoy to discuss specific
                                    <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> problems with appropriate US
                                staff representatives. He urged General <persName corresp="#p_SGC1"
                                    >Sunay</persName> to take the necessary action in his area to
                                resolve the problems related to the construction of the troposcatter
                                communications facilities in order that this facility, which is so
                                important to both countries and to <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                    >NATO</gloss> could be completed as soon as possible. General
                                Lemnitzer felt the conference had been very helpful to him and he
                                appreciated having the benefit of General <persName

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SS1">Sarper</persName> stressed that continued
                            political stability in Turkey and the success of the newly-elected
                            democratic government depends heavily on a sound economic situation.
                            Austerity measures about to be instituted will be unpopular and can
                            weaken the government. Hence US aid is most important. Military aid
                            presently is inadequate in quantity and quality—especially in quality.
                            It is impossible to carry out the tasks assigned to Turkey by <gloss
                                target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> with aid at its present levels.
                            Turkey needs $100 million additional military aid and $200 million
                            additional economic aid over and above the level of past years. The
                            situation is made more difficult because of $126 million repayment of
                            consolidated debts under the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>
                            program. <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Sarper</persName> said he was most
                            anxious to be able to convey something encouraging to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> as a result of the
                            conversation with the Secretary. In response to the Secretary’s
                            question, <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Sarper</persName> explained that
                            the government’s Interim Plan for 1962 is completed and accepted. The
                            Five-year Plan for 1963–68 has been written and is being translated into
                            English. <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Sarper</persName> indicated the text
                            would be available to Mr. <persName>Van Dyke</persName> of the US
                            Embassy in Ankara. In response to the Secretary’s question as to whether
                            IBRD would be brought into the picture, <persName corresp="#p_SS1"
                                >Sarper</persName> implied it would be, adding that he felt Eugene
                            Black had been somewhat mistreated by the former government and that he
                            hoped Black would be more prone to cooperate with the new government.
                            The Secretary pointed out that limitations on the overall amount of aid
                            of various types present very difficult problems in meeting Turkey’s
                            requests. Supporting assistance in particular has been cut back. This
                            type of direct budget support aid has been under very great pressure in
                            Washington. The military aid situation is also tight. More flexibility
                            has been obtained for <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> loans. In
                            general the requested large increases over the present level will prove
                            very difficult. The US will also want to see whether some other
                            international agencies cannot help in Turkish situation.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Sarper</persName> said he had heard a rumor
                            that US plans to work out a $90 million arrangement with Egypt, whereas
                            only $70 million is contemplated for Turkey. <persName corresp="#p_SS1"
                                >Sarper</persName> complained that this seemed unreasonable. Nasser
                            gets more for being “nasty.” <persName corresp="#p_SS1"
                                >Sarper</persName> made a strong plea for help to the new Turkish
                            government, saying that Turkey itself desperately needs the new
                            democratic government, and the US needs it just as much. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SS1">Sarper</persName> said he had gone through the
                            revolution and knew <pb n="719" xml:id="pg_719" facs="0741"/>what it
                            meant. The underlying problem for the new government will be economic.
                            It is hard to say what will happen in Turkey if the new government does
                            not succeed. The Secretary repeated that the major problem is the large
                            figure for additional aid. He said he was unable talk in terms of
                            specific figures at this time, but that the US will do the best it can.
                            He wanted, however, to avoid saying something now that would lead to
                            later disappointment in Ankara when the final figures become known. The
                            Secretary pointed out that we had already made considerable aid

                            aid to Turkey.</p>

                            that our aid to the revolutionary government had been instrumental in

                            responsive to those parts of presentation emphasizing planning and
                            self-help. He also seemed accept without question limitations under

                            invigorate assistance program within our capabilities.</p>
                        <p>At conclusion of presentation he made these observations.</p>
                        <p>Firstly, he expressed appreciation for our effort to clarify aid
                            situation. Said he now had some understanding of complexity of
                            assistance processes and believed our presentation would be useful
                            guide. He would turn it over to officials concerned with aid for study
                            and necessary action.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, he said he was still troubled regarding military situation. If
                            by misfortune war should come, result could be quick and decisive. That
                            meant advance preparedness at necessary level to meet responsibility.
                            But war now extremely expensive and difficult see how Turkey can
                            continue burden, even with present level assistance of US. While
                            emphasizing his preoccupation with this subject he also indicated that
                            his ideas not yet thought through but he said would want discuss again
                            since he very troubled.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, he said wished make clear that Turkey, while wishing avoid
                            needless provocation of Soviets, is firm adherent of Western bloc <pb
                                n="721" xml:id="pg_721" facs="0743"/>and will not change. At present
                            time, Soviets conducting “aggressive peace offensive” which will
                            foreseeably fail and be followed by concerted campaign of abuse by
                            Soviets and their satellites but Turkey is used to such tactics and will
                            know how to maintain its position in the future as it has in the past.
                            In this connection, he gave summary his conversation with Soviet
                            Ambassador Rijov which corresponded exactly with <persName
                                corresp="#p_SS1">Sarper</persName> version as reported <gloss

                        <p>At conclusion, I mentioned recent spate of pernicious press articles on
                            US aid, saying I had kept silent so far but would suggest might be
                            counteracted by taking line that situation with regard aid good and
                            merely question trying make it better as contrasted press tendency to
                            discuss in terms of rectifying intolerable situation. <persName
                                corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> agreed and asked which of us
                            should take initiative. I suggested both of us and he acquiesced.</p>
                        <p>Although nature of our response was in quite different vein from that of
                                <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>’s original request for
                            large lump sums for supplemental assistance he not only refrained from
                            pressing his original demands but actually seemed be appreciative of
                            lengths to which we had gone in trying understand his problem and in
                            taking action or making suggestions to assist. It is, of course, to be
                            expected that development of specific points will involve tough
                            bargaining later and that further demands will be made but would seem
                            that we may have at least gotten <persName corresp="#p_II1"
                                >Inonu</persName> back on track and in surprisingly good spirit.</p>

                            He also asked “<gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> and other

                            sympathetic military take-over. He said he knew us too well believe any
                            such thing and had so told Prime Minister but wondered how such stories
                            could get started. He speculated might be Soviet inspired or propagated

                            origin of stories, I said nature our relationship such that we naturally
                            have extensive contacts with Turkish military which might be adversely
                            exploited if any such officers were of restive type as I suspected few
                            might be. However, this would be gross misrepresentation since our stand
                            absolutely clear.</p>

                            that principles of May 27 coup would not continue be applied. He said at

                        <p>4677. From <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>. Following is
                            report on General <persName corresp="#p_NLGL1">Norstad</persName>’s
                            visit to Ankara April 2 at invitation Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_NLGL1">Norstad</persName> concludes that primary
                            purposes of invitation were (1) to re-emphasize strong Turkish ties with
                            US and (2) to express concern regarding what Turks fear may be tendency
                            of US to differentiate between “general war” and “local actions”, with
                            result that US would not come to Turks assistance in event of latter.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_NLGL1">Norstad</persName> also took
                            occasion to stress his view of importance of stability in Turkey and
                            role which armed forces could play in this. Details follow.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_NLGL1">Norstad</persName> had long,
                            extremely cordial talk with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_II1"
                                >Inonu</persName> [who] said he wished give <persName
                                corresp="#p_NLGL1">Norstad</persName> most positive assurances that
                            Turkey would live up to its commitments to <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>, to the US and to West. He expressed himself in strong
                            terms and reiterated this point several times.</p>
                        <p>He spoke very warmly of US. He mentioned that one of problems in last two
                            world wars was doubt as to whether US would enter conflict. Now
                            uncertainly regarding US role has been prevented by membership of US in
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Nevertheless, he went on to
                            say that Turkey is somewhat concerned about repeated discussions of
                            difference between general war on one hand and, on other hand,
                            incursions, infiltrations and local actions. One of Turkey’s great
                            worries is that local aggression against her would not be regarded as
                            important enough to warrant response by US or other <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_NLGL1">Norstad</persName> responded that
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> treaty does not differentiate
                            between types of attack; if country can not deal with situation itself
                            then other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries would come to
                            its aid. US had demonstrated amply its ability to support Turkey in
                            event of attack, and he referred to presence of Sixth Fleet in
                            Mediterranean, Exercise Checkmate, et cetera. He also mentioned
                            development of mobile force. Dispatch of mobile force to assist in
                            coping with local incident would serve to put defense against such
                            incident on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-wide basis. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_NLGL1">Norstad</persName> said there should be
                            no question on part of Turkey about sincerity and determination of US in
                            doing everything necessary to defend Turkey.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> picked up <persName
                                corresp="#p_NLGL1">Norstad</persName>’s reference to requirement
                            that country attacked should attempt to cope with attack by its own
                            means in first instance. He said this raised question of status of
                            Turkish forces and need for help in equipment and supply of forces. He
                            thanked <persName corresp="#p_NLGL1">Norstad</persName>
                            <pb n="725" xml:id="pg_725" facs="0747"/>for US support in past and
                            asked understanding for continuing Turkish need in this regard. Army
                            requires increased mobility. Navy needs modernization. As for Air Force,
                                <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> said “it needs
                            everything”. General <persName corresp="#p_NLGL1">Norstad</persName>
                            said US is aware of Turkish problems concerning equipment. He reminded
                                <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> of extensive US aid to
                            Turkey in past and said he was sure that US would continue to accord
                            special consideration to Turkish needs. He mentioned that this also was
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> problem and that he would
                            insure that other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries were
                            made aware of situation.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_NLGL1">Norstad</persName> strongly
                            recommended that Turkish authorities deal closely with US Embassy and
                                <gloss target="#t_JUSMMAT1">JUSMMAT</gloss> on aid problems.
                                <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> spoke very warmly of
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HRA1">Hare</persName> as good friend of
                            Turkey with deep understanding of country. These comments concerning
                            Ambassador were echoed in later conversations with Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> and General <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGC1">Sunay</persName>.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_NLGL1">Norstad</persName> saw President
                                <persName corresp="#p_GC1">Gursel</persName> in afternoon. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Sunay</persName> also participated in
                            conversation. General <persName corresp="#p_NLGL1">Norstad</persName>
                            found that there had been great change physically in <persName
                                corresp="#p_GC1">Gursel</persName> since he last saw him about a

                                    corresp="#p_GC1">Gursel</persName> had suffered a stroke on
                                April 27, 1961.</note> Although his mind seems clear, he appeared to
                            speak with some difficulty and had lost his former animation. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GC1">Gursel</persName> also spoke of ties with <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and emphasized his view that <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries should stand together as
                            one, “like a chain.” <persName corresp="#p_GC1">Gursel</persName> said
                            that suppression of recent attempted revolt had left government in
                            stronger position. He had been pleased with manner in which Constitution
                            had been established and Parliament installed, remarking that these
                            actions had caused less trouble than anticipated. For future, <persName
                                corresp="#p_GC1">Gursel</persName> foresaw gradual improvement in
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_NLGL1">Norstad</persName> in his remarks
                            (which were particularly for General <persName corresp="#p_SGC1"
                                >Sunay</persName>’s benefit) emphasized that political stability is
                            essential to over-all improvement. Undoubtedly some public funds could
                            be obtained for economic progress, but real requirement was for private
                            capital. This could only come if confidence is established in
                            government. He felt this was biggest task facing Turkish authorities,
                            both military and political. <persName corresp="#p_GC1"
                                >Gursel</persName> readily agreed with these remarks. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGC1">Sunay</persName> obviously took them in but showed
                            no reaction.</p>
                        <p>In separate talk with General <persName corresp="#p_SGC1"
                                >Sunay</persName>, General <persName corresp="#p_NLGL1"
                                >Norstad</persName> likewise stressed importance of stability. He
                            said armed forces have been successful in controlling situation and
                            overcoming crisis; now attention should be given to building up strength

                                >Gursel</persName> in which <persName corresp="#p_GC1"

                        <p><gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> observed that even in US, military

                            Iraq has received from USSR. Noteworthy, <pb n="727" xml:id="pg_727"

                            delivery two squadrons F–104–G’s to Turkey. <gloss target="#t_PRIMIN1"
                                >PriMin</gloss> asked when these aircraft would be delivered.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> replied US officials would be able to
                            talk about details later. Foreign aid bill itself is still under debate
                            in Congress. Turkey would also receive 225,000 M–1 rifles.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> noted these are difficult years for US
                                <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> and government revenues have
                            been less than were anticipated. National debt limit must be raised by
                            statute from $300 billion to 308 billion. There will be considerable
                            deficit this year and next. New tax measure will be acted on in Congress
                            this week, and President will send broad tax reform measure to Congress
                            in January. We must spend in area of $60 billion in coming year for
                            military and space programs. We also have commitments to provide foreign
                            assistance in various forms, economic, military, or defense support in a
                            few instances.</p>
                        <p>Since World War II we have already spent more than $80 billion in various
                            foreign programs. We have political problem much like one the Prime
                            Minister would face if he wished to make large Turkish Government
                            expenditure in some faraway place like Texas. In [omission in the source
                            text] one with whom we would [garble] we have more confidence than we
                            have in Turkish people. <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> said he was
                            proud of position he took as young Congressman on Greek-Turkish aid 15
                            years ago when former Vice President Wallace was opposing. His
                            philosophy was that if you allow a bully to force you off the street and
                            make you [garble] home down an alley, he will come up the next day and
                            kick you off your front porch. We very proud of performance of Turkish
                            people. Since passage of original foreign aid bill, we have put almost
                            $4 billion into aid to Turkey. This is almost as much as total annual
                            federal budget when <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> first came to
                            Washington. Times have chanced since then; in FY ’63 we are tentatively
                            planning to provide Turkey in neighborhood of $185 million in military
                            assistance and $140 million to $150 million in economic assistance as
                            well as $50 to $60 million in defense support.</p>
                        <p>All information from projected levels of aid for Turkey is highly
                            classified and should it become known in other countries exactly what we
                            are doing in Turkey there could be unfortunate consequences. These
                            figures have been cited to indicate our great confidence and interests
                            in Turkey. “They are not just conversation; we put our money where our
                            mouth is.” <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> concluded by asking Prime
                            Minister for any thoughts and comments which could be taken back to
                            Washington.</p>
                        <pb n="728" xml:id="pg_728" facs="0750"/>
                        <p>At this point the <gloss target="#t_PRIMIN1">PriMin</gloss> asked his
                            interpreter to take notes on the aid figures mentioned by the Vice
                            President. <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> repeated figures and added
                            that he had approved $33 million development plan to Etibank for
                            hydro-electric dam project, though we did not want to make public
                            announcement of loan at this time. Moreover all projected aid figures
                            are subject to change by Congress. These figures represented our
                            thinking at time aid request was submitted to Congress, and amount
                            projected for Turkey is about $400 million. This information extremely
                            confidential. With regard development loans, cash flow may vary from
                            year to year, depending on many factors, but this indicated range of our
                            thinking. This information on US [aid] to Turkey does not constitute
                            commitment. We are saying to Iran, Greece and to other <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries that we cannot give them
                            defense support, but we are not saying this to Turkey. Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> said <gloss
                                target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> had brought to Turkey an atmosphere of
                            security. Fact that greetings of friendship from President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had been brought by such a
                            distinguished representative constituted cause great happiness for all
                            Turkish people. Vice President’s statements show US following Turkey’s
                            problems closely. After passing through severe crisis, Turkey has
                            reached solid decision to adopt democratic system and stick with it.
                                <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> knew that other countries passing
                            through similar crises were unable recover in such short time. Results
                            of past year are very promising.</p>
                        <p>A second problem occupying Turkey, said Prime Minister, is institution of
                            planned development. We have been working for a year to secure the
                            agreement among our friends which implementation of our plans will
                            require. We have found US a helpful friend in these matters in <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and other international
                            organizations. Securing the required legislation in connection with
                            development plans is not easy. Just this morning he had discussed this
                            problem with his colleagues and had talked to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_GC1">Gursel</persName> about it.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> said President
                                <persName corresp="#p_GC1">Gursel</persName> was taking advantage of
                            the presence of so distinguished a visitor to explain Turkey’s military
                            requirements. They had already discussed these requirements several
                            times with distinguished military representatives and with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRA1">Hare</persName>. These discussions are
                            continuing. They are asking several things from US and US is doing its
                            best to meet these demands. Of course, US is trying to meet demands of
                            other countries and has heard each one claim that it is more important
                            than others.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_PRIMIN1">PriMin</gloss> said he had one specific point
                            to make in this connection, which is necessity of accelerating delivery
                            of military aircraft to Turkey. In current attitudes of Iraq he
                            perceived a dangerous situation which originated with the ideas of the
                            Iraqi Head of State. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense is a
                            big problem, concerning aggression by major powers, and with the
                            extensive planning required left in hands of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> commander. The area <pb n="729" xml:id="pg_729"
                                facs="0751"/>of Iraq, however, is theroretically out of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and Iraq is engaged in arms race
                            with Turkey as concerns military aircraft. They have done well in first
                            lap of this race. It should be expected that Turkey’s small neighbors
                            might take advantage of smalll incidents which affect adversely their
                            relationships with Turkey. We have plans for modernizing our armed
                            forces, and some measures have been taken to implement these plans,
                            however, we badly need acceleration of deliveries to provide our
                            requirements in military aircraft. We touched by <gloss target="#t_VP1"
                                >VP</gloss>’s appreciation of skill of our armed forces, but
                            strength of our military aviation is closely tied to quality of our
                            equipment. Acceleration of delivery of M–1 rifles would be greatly
                            appreciated, and we expect the two squadrons of F–104–G’s to arrive as
                            soon as possible. In light of recent developments it would be desirable
                            add another squadron these aircraft.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> said situation has not

                            on part of US. One of results of our determination to adopt a democratic
                            system following revolution is that our social problems have become more
                            important and more heated, and success of our system will depend largely
                            on implementation of our development plans. We feel our political
                            difficulties will be resolved if our planned economic development is

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Komer</persName> added that <gloss target="#t_VP1"

                            Turkish Government. Turkish Government should bear in mind that (1) as

                            figures of what we hope to do, not what we necessarily could do; (2) it
                            was most important that Turks regard such figures as highly
                            confidential; if other Allies became aware of how much aid we plan to
                            provide Turkey and which we are not planning to provide to these other

                                Turkey regards these Jupiters as symbol of alliance’s determination

                                large conventional or nuclear forces, although Turks have been most

                                western hemisphere countries). Unless we can avoid setting such
                                pattern, this could foreshadow dangerous and divisive situation for
                                    <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> alliance because other

                                Therefore, any deal re Cuba should be compensated for by other

                                context, whole alliance might be dismayed by such a deal which would

                                heads of government decision in 1957 in response to boastful Soviet
                                    <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> threat to Europe, and
                                alliance might very well conclude that US was willing weaken nuclear
                                defenses in Europe in order to remove threat in western hemisphere.
                                However, cannot discount possibility that some members alliance
                                might be willing accept Cuba-Turk deal “to avoid nuclear war”, i.e.,

                            <item>Re question of removal Jupiters accompanied by stationing of
                                Polaris submarines in area, doubt whether mere deployment Polaris
                                would be attractive to Turks since they really would have no say in
                                use of Polaris in time of crisis and they turned down similar
                                proposal in April 1961. Nevertheless, one might argue Turks really
                                have no say over Jupiter use now because of custodial arrangements,
                                but they feel some assurance in having weapons on their territory
                                and somewhat in their hands. Turkish concern re Polaris substitution
                                might be partially met by consulting them on targeting so as to
                                assure that targets of interest to them are covered by Polaris. Also

                                obsolete Jupiters. Such offer would take form of converting a number

                                of trade, we believe that in any event strong consideration should

                        <p>The Turkish Ambassador, acting on the urgent instructions of his
                            Government, called on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName>
                            on October 29. First, he said, he wished to extend the thanks and
                            gratitude of his Government for President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                                >Kennedy</persName>’s refusal of any “deal” with the Soviet Union
                            regarding the missile bases in Turkey.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, he wished to inform the United States Government that the
                            Turkish Government had instructed its permanent representative in <pb

                                >NATO</gloss> to ask urgently for a special session of the North
                            Atlantic Council. At this special session, the Turkish permanent
                            representative would review the events which led up to the <gloss
                                target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>’s being stationed in Turkey and would
                            emphasize that the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>’s were placed
                            in Turkey not merely for Turkey’s defense but for <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense. The Turkish permanent
                            representative would state that the Turkish Government regretted that,
                            when dangers subsequently appeared, some seemed to regard Turkey as at
                            fault. Turkey wished to discuss this turn of events with its allies.
                            (The Ambassador the referred to press comments in various allied
                            countries and to some non-United States personalities who spoke in the
                            same tone.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName> stated his appreciation
                            for the advance information the Ambassador had given us and said he
                            wished to repeat and to reinforce what the Ambassador had said regarding
                            the circumstances that led to the placing of the missiles on Turkish
                            soil. The United States Government, he said, looked at these from the
                            point of view of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> complex.
                            These missiles were for the defense of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> area and that defense was indivisible. The United
                            States viewed our commitment in all areas of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> as being equal. Furthermore, he hoped that Ankara
                            would not pay too much attention to our own press comment which had
                            ranged far and wide. Even we, he said, wondered at times whether a given
                            article had been inspired, was a trial balloon or what. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Menemencioglu</persName> interrupted to
                            say that he recognized the freedom of our press but had noticed that it
                            was disciplined when the facts were known and mentioned particularly
                            that the line taken by the press today (October 29) was a very good one.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName> said that the Secretary
                            had recently talked with the press on a background basis.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName> stated that the Cuban
                            crisis was not yet settled and that we would know tonight if work on the
                            bases had been stopped. We had, he said, resumed aerial surveillance
                            today. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName> stated that he
                            wished to reassure the Ambassador again that there had been no “deal”
                            regarding Turkey. The Ambassador responded that he had no doubt of that.
                            He remarked upon the audacity of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> in drawing a parallel between Turkey and
                            Cuba. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName> said that there
                            was nothing in the arrangement with the Soviets which implied a
                            guarantee of the Castro regime. We had only stated we would not attack
                            Cuba. We had based our action on the Rio Treaty.</p>

                                    reciprocal concessions, e.g., some general limitation on <gloss
                                        target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> deployment or on offensive
                                    strategic nuclear bases. This possibility is being explored by
                                    ACDA. For purposes of the discussion that follows, however, it
                                    is assumed that this possibility is not sufficiently promising
                                    to obviate the need for now taking steps that would facilitate a
                                    unilateral Turkish decision to remove the <gloss
                                        target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>’s.</p>
                                <p>The Turks will only take such a decision in good grace if they
                                    feel that an adequate substitute is at hand. Deployment of US
                                    Polaris submarines to the Mediterranean would not constitute
                                    such a substitute, even if it were accompanied by such other
                                    steps as pre-stocking of US equipment in Turkey, rotation of US
                                    forces to Turkey, military aid to Turkey etc.—helpful though
                                    these steps would undoubtedly be.</p>
                                <p>The heart of the matter is this: The Turks now have in the
                                    Jupiters a nuclear missile system which they own, which they are
                                    beginning to man, and in whose control they can participate.
                                    They would take poorly to any arrangement which deprived them of
                                    that system without equivalent participation in another nuclear
                                    missile system in return.</p>
                                <p>Their reaction to such an arrangement would suggest urbi et orbi
                                    that their security had been sacrificed by the US for its own
                                    interests; a general suspicion that this was, in fact, the case
                                    could have an unnerving <pb n="736" xml:id="pg_736" facs="0758"
                                    />effect on the alliance as a whole and eat into the prestige
                                    dividends we have so far earned in Cuba.</p>
                                <p>The only way to avoid this reaction would be to offer the Turks
                                    the alternative of either another national Turkish <gloss
                                        target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> force or of a multilateral
                                        <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> force, to replace the
                                        <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>’s. Of the two, the
                                    latter is clearly to be preferred; another Turkish national
                                    force would generate the same Soviet and other pressures that
                                    are now being directed against Turkish <gloss target="#t_IRBM1"

                                <p>We should now consult with the countries concerned about such a
                                    force, as part of the follow-up to the US October 22 <gloss

                                    send our travelling <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> team
                                    on the road, as we indicated on October 22 that we would,
                                    beginning with Ottawa, Rome, Ankara, and Athens, where it could
                                    surface the concept of the small pilot southern force. While the
                                    team was thus doing business in home capitals, we would be
                                    consulting with the Embassies concerned here, and Ambassador
                                        <persName corresp="#p_FTK1">Finletter</persName> would be
                                    consulting the appropriate PermReps in Paris.</p>
                                <p>Since the size and cost of a pilot force would be limited, the
                                    Italians—who have been doing some work on their own in regard to
                                    sea-based deployment—might see an opportunity for alliance
                                    leadership in opening up this possibility in the <gloss
                                        target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>.</p>
                                <p>It is not inconceivable that agreement in principle could be
                                    reached by the countries concerned fairly rapidly. Both the
                                    Turks and the Italians reacted favorably to the October 22
                                    concept; they would also see the advantages of getting on with
                                    the pilot force, as a means of gracefully phasing out land-based
                                        <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>’s, which they would
                                    expect to be the object of increasing pressures in the
                                    post-Cuban period. The Canadians have also shown themselves
                                    favorable to the multilateral concept.</p>
                                <p>The US would have to participate, and to be prepared to evidence
                                    its oft-repeated willingness to bear its fair share of
                                    multilateral <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> cost, if the
                                    pilot force were to come into being. This force might be about
                                    the size (48 missiles—6 ships) of the Turkish and Italian <gloss
                                        target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> force that it would replace,
                                    instead of the 200 missiles and 25 ships that have been
                                    discussed for the total <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                                    force.</p>
                                <p>We could make clear that the US contribution to this pilot force
                                    would be all that the US would contribute in the way of money to
                                    any <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> multilateral force,
                                    since the other European countries which might form a larger
                                    force after <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> negotiations
                                    should be able to pay their own way. (Indeed, these countries
                                    could buy out the US and Canada, if they wanted to set up an
                                    all-European force at that time.)</p>
                                <pb n="737" xml:id="pg_737" facs="0759"/>
                                <p>In a force with the membership of the pilot force, pressures for
                                    a control formula excluding US participation would probably be
                                    minimal. US warhead custody could be maintained, as the Germans
                                    have suggested, while the problem of long-term control
                                    arrangements was being studied. This would ease our problem with
                                    the JCAE, although the problem would remain of the Committee’s
                                    past concern as to whether meaningful US custody is possible
                                    aboard non-US ships.</p>
                                <p>The British ought not object to agreement now being reached on a
                                    small pilot Southern Command force, since this would not
                                    directly affect the politically sensitive issues of Germany’s
                                    nuclear status or of post-<gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                                    Franco-British nuclear relations. The British will, furthermore,
                                    be as anxious as anyone to see Turkish <gloss target="#t_IRBM1"
                                        >IRBM</gloss>’s phased out and the relation of a Southern
                                    Command force to such phasing out will not escape them.</p>
                                <p>Once agreement had been reached in principle on the Southern
                                    Force by the countries concerned, it would probably not be
                                    difficult to move the Turkish and Italian governments to
                                    indicate, in the course of <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>
                                    discussion, that they would wish to phase out <gloss
                                        target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>’s at an appropriate time,
                                    since they would not need and could not afford both to operate
                                        <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>’s and to participate
                                    in the pilot force.</p>
                                <p>These Turkish and Italian statements could then be made public,
                                    which should help to reduce pressures and agitation over Turkish
                                        <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>’s.</p>
                                <p>Once that agitation had died down, it might be possible to
                                    persuade the Turks to start taking out the <gloss
                                        target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>’s long before the Southern
                                    Force came about, in view of the prospect of that Force and the
                                    interim coverage provided by US Polaris.</p>
                                <p>In acting along these lines, the alliance would have not only met
                                    the Turkish <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> problem in a
                                    constructive fashion; it would also have taken a concrete step
                                    toward strengthening nuclear aspects of the partnership. Such a
                                    step would be useful in meeting European concerns over the
                                    Soviet <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>’s; these concerns
                                    are likely to grow in the wake of a crisis triggered by
                                    deployment in Cuba of one tenth as many <gloss target="#t_MRBM1"
                                        >MRBM</gloss>’s as now threaten Europe. And such a step
                                    would establish a pattern and precedent, which would be extended
                                    after <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> negotiations, if the
                                    other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries concerned
                                    were willing to pay the freight.</p></item>

                            <item>Proposed replacement was explained in terms of a desire to

                                the Soviets should US have been forced to undertake military action
                                against Cuba. In view of high vulnerability and advancing
                                obsolescence, these systems should be replaced with more modern and

                                example, occur in the near future over Berlin. In this way Alliance
                                would have benefit of more effective deterrent force while denying

                            <item>Turkish <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss> Sancar appeared more
                                cautious and reserved in his response. Though he agreed to “submit
                                and expose” US views to Turkish government, he said substitution of
                                more secure weapon system for Jupiter must take into account all
                                political and military factors. Indicated that core of problem was
                                Turkey’s confidence in its Allies; that there was need to avoid
                                moral depression either in people or Army. Warned against creating
                                impression that “best of Allies was leaving Turkey to a condition of
                                aloneness.” <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                                indicated that replacement by more efficient and invulnerable

                            of statement specifying that allocated units of United States strategic
                            forces, United Kingdom bomber command and tactical nuclear forces now in

                            nuclear force and targeted in accordance <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> plans, that same provisions also applied Polaris
                            force, and that this seen as step toward multilateral <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> force.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister said this clear and what he really had in mind was any
                            possible pertinence of this development to his discussion with Secretary
                            re removal of Jupiters from Turkey, i.e., would British-American
                            agreement constitute means by which Polaris substitute might be made for
                            Jupiters.</p>
                        <p>I replied that, speaking personally, it would seem that, if a
                            multilateral nuclear <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> force were
                            immediately in prospect, Jupiter case might be considered in that
                            context but, since even British-American agreement will take certain
                            time to implement, I would assume that any early substitution for
                            Jupiters would be made under different guise.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister said this seemed logical but, since Jupiter question so
                            important to <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>, he would appreciate
                            any corroborative or supplemental comment which might be available from

                        <p>I said would be glad inquire, and would appreciate guidance as to reply
                            which Department desires made.</p>

                        <p>“5 Jan 1963.</p>
                        <p>“Dear Mr. Minister:</p>
                        <p>“You will recall that, during our conversation in Paris on December
                                13,<note n="1" xml:id="d386fn1">See <ref target="#d384fn1">footnote
                                    1, Document 384</ref>.</note> I expressed the view that the
                            Jupiter missiles should be replaced by improved missiles now becoming
                            available.</p>
                        <p>“In 1957 when the decision was made to install these missiles they, along
                            with the Thors, were the only strategic ballistic missiles the Alliance
                            had ready for operation. The Jupiters helped greatly to build up our
                            early ballistic missile strength, but, with the rapid advances in
                            technology and the accelerating growth of missile forces, they no longer
                            form a major part of the Alliance’s missile strength. In this year
                            alone, the number of operational strategic ballistic missiles in the
                            Alliance will increase from about 450 to abut 850. More importantly, as
                            a first generation missile these Jupiters are easily located by the
                            enemy and vulnerable to both conventional and nuclear attack. It is
                            questionable whether they would survive a Soviet surprise attack. Such a
                            system today promises to be relatively ineffective and it presents a
                            vulnerable and tempting target—conditions which we should seek to avoid
                            if we can find an alternative weapon system which better meets our
                            military needs. This is especially true since we must continue to
                            anticipate Soviet stimulated crises of comparable or even greater
                            intensity as for example might occur at any time over Berlin.</p>
                        <p>“It seems to us desirable on these counts to replace the Jupiters with an
                            alternative weapon system which better meets our common needs and, in
                            connection with the replacement, to accelerate the delivery of another
                            modern weapon system, the F–104Gs.</p>
                        <p>“We believe the best available alternative to Jupiter would be the
                            Polaris missile submarine system. In addition to being less exposed than
                            the Jupiters, these missiles would have a very much higher probability
                                <pb n="744" xml:id="pg_744" facs="0766"/>of survival in the face of
                            a sudden nuclear attack. We propose that Polaris submarines operate in
                            the Mediterranean, be assigned to <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1"
                                >SACEUR</gloss> and be targeted by him with Turkish participation.
                            This Polaris force can be on station by April 1.</p>
                        <p>“I strongly agree with the sense of your comment to me as to the
                            importance of our Allies and our enemies understanding that the
                            substitution of this modern weapon system creates a more formidable
                            military posture for Turkey and for <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. It has been our policy and will continue to be our
                            policy to assist our Allies in the provision of increasingly effective
                            military defenses through a measured and continued phase-in of modern
                            weapons. In this way the Alliance can have the benefit of the most
                            effective deterrent force we are capable of devising while denying to

                            threatening attacks against highly vulnerable weapons of more limited
                            military value.</p>
                        <p>“We wish it to be clearly understood that in advancing the proposal for
                            substitution of Polaris for Jupiters, we envisage working out all
                            aspects in closest harmony with the Turkish government and would of
                            course be responsive to your view on how the substitution can most
                            expeditiously be effected. Finally, we would believe that Alliance
                            interests would best be served if the substitution were conducted in a
                            low key as a natural evolution to a better weapon system, as in fact is
                            the case, rather than having the substitution misrepresented in any way.
                            In this connection, I think we might consider making clear to the
                            Alliance that our two governments previously discussed this matter as
                            far back as April 1961.</p>
                        <p>“Since my return from Paris I have looked into the possibility of
                            associating an acceleration of the delivery of F–104G aircraft to Turkey
                            with the replacement of the Jupiters. By a series of emergency actions,
                            I believe it would be possible to deliver sufficient aircraft to Turkey
                            to equip the first squadron in April 1963; this could be done as part of
                            this modernization program.</p>
                        <p>“If your government agrees with these proposals, appropriate staffs of
                            our two governments in cooperation with <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1"

                                        the Free World could make to the Soviet threat as it was
                                        then apparent to us. The value of weapons systems changes,
                                        however. Nuclear delivery systems falling between the first
                                        efforts and the first generations of highly invulnerable,
                                        fast, accurate, and reliable systems such as Polaris and
                                        Minuteman have been shown to have a very short lifetime of
                                        military usefulness. We feel that the Jupiter system has
                                        simply been outmoded. Its vulnerability and relatively slow
                                        reaction time make it a standing temptation for an enemy
                                        first strike, nuclear or conventional, and its manning and
                                        maintenance make it a drain on resources which could be put
                                        to better use. The Jupiters on Turkish soil do not represent
                                        a military error; they have performed a perhaps critical
                                        duty in deterring aggression against the alliance. But, like
                                        all other weapons, they eventually reach obsolescence, as we
                                        mentioned to you in April 1961. The immense efforts we have
                                        devoted to the improvement of our nuclear delivery capacity
                                        have rendered their period of useful life shorter than is
                                        the case with other types of weapons. Jupiter was from the

                            next week. In this connection, he also indicated that Turkish reaction
                            regarding assignment and manning Polaris subs would foreseeably be

                                replacement. (Ibid., 782.56311/1–2863)</note> As result reftel we
                            are in position of having two replies our proposal substitution Polaris
                            for Jupiter missiles, one official government position conveyed by
                                <gloss target="#t_FONMIN1">FonMin</gloss> and one from MinDef. Both
                            accept our proposal in principle but then raise different specifics in
                            terms of reaching final agreement. Sancar letter gives endorsement our
                            proposal but then makes four conditions first of which namely, delivery
                            of nuclear weapons for F–100 strike squadrons before replacement
                            Jupiters, can prove difficult if Turks really insist. Three numbered
                            conditions are worded in general terms and possibly could be handled by
                            general assurances and explanations. However, since these are termed
                            “initial conditions”, paragraphs one and two may turn out have more
                            concrete meaning as negotiation advances; for instance, mention of
                            “modernization” of Turkish Armed Forces may raise question multi-year
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> with inclusion much-desired
                            items and mention of “legal participation” in point two might, as
                            previously indicated, raise question some form Turkish presence on
                            Polaris force. Reference in last paragraph to “other <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries” obviously means Italy and
                            tends to confirm our earlier assumption that fact negotiation not being
                            confined Turkey is helpful factor.</p>
                        <p>Transmission of letter would seem leave open two courses of action: (1)
                            take governmental reply as given us and act thereon as soon as we have
                            received additional instructions requested <gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1"

                                (Ibid., 711.5611/1–2563)</note> or, (2) having allowed several days
                            for assumed transmission of letter, make reply of composite nature to
                                <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName>, including reaction to
                            points raised by Sancar. My feeling now is we should go ahead on basis
                            (1) above and see what happens leaving open possibility of blending two
                            channels on assumption that <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName>
                            will reflect MinDef points if they become government policy.<note n="3"

                            deliver reply to Turkish “conditions”.</p>
                        <p>Without attempting debate crew question <persName corresp="#p_EF1"
                                >Erkin</persName> said very disappointed we unable to agree to some
                            sort of formula which would associate Polaris with Turkish Command. Said
                            he under constant pressure and criticism by those who maintain that
                            substitution of Polaris for Jupiter represents indication of reduced
                            American interest in Turkey and that, when he attempts rebut such
                            allegations, he is told that he is just saying what they would expect
                            from a Foreign Minister and that his critics therefore remain
                            unconvinced.</p>
                        <p>While I recalled that fact is this is important move toward modernization
                            in Mediterranean by which <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            generally and Turkey specifically will benefit, <persName
                                corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> said he understood but this was
                            not sort of argument that convinces critics. Problem is essentially
                            psychological and something more obviously demonstrable required than
                            visits to Turkish ports or visits Turkish officers to Polaris subs.</p>
                        <p>I then suggested that, aside from continuing to point out that Polaris
                            substitution is strengthening move, public relations line to counteract
                            current criticism should be given positive twist by putting emphasis on
                            multilateral force in which <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            partners, including Turkey, will in fact be given opportunity for
                            different types of participation, including mixed manning. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> somewhat grudgingly agreed but
                            still maintained something more tangible regarding Polaris would help
                            out a great deal.</p>
                        <p>I also requested as instructed that care be exerted to avoid any leak
                            that Command question had even been discussed. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> said he absolutely agreed but had
                            been distressed to note that there had in fact been such a reference in
                            yesterday’s Aksam. He was at loss know how it had happened and I feel
                            quite certain his unhappiness was not feigned.</p>
                        <p>We next turned to 104–G’s and I transmitted supplemental information as
                            instructed. <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> said understood
                            in certain Turkish quarters that original fourteen would be additional
                            to two squadrons programmed and he would appreciate my inquiring if this
                            correct. I replied unnecessary do so since I had knowledge that what we
                            are doing is to respond to oft-repeated request of Turkish Air Force to
                            expedite delivery of programmed planes; not question of expanding
                            program at this <pb n="754" xml:id="pg_754" facs="0776"/>point. Any such
                            discussion would have to take its place in normal context of <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> procurement.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> then noted with approval that
                            US training group being held for quick assignment to Turkey and asked if
                            they would bring training planes with them since 104–G’s would not be
                            arriving until later. I said uninformed of details but assumed training
                            group would have what necessary to perform their function
                            competently.</p>
                        <p>I then noted that we had received letter from Minister Defense Sancar for
                            transmission to Secretary Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                >McNamara</persName>, asked if <persName corresp="#p_EF1"
                                >Erkin</persName> familiar with it and, if so, whether there was
                            anything of significance in it which might have bearing on our
                            discussions. <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> said had read
                            it and would send me copy. Regarding contents, he said nothing of
                            importance going beyond what already communicated to us previously. In
                            this connection he heartily endorsed idea of single channel of
                            communication henceforth.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister then asked what next to be done, mentioning presumed
                            necessity of agreement to remove Jupiters to replace existing agreement.
                            I said this also my understanding and also necessary supplement informal
                            advice to <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> on January 30 by joint
                            written communication. However, what is essential at this stage is
                            clearly to establish that we are in agreement on the basis of our
                            proposals as explained and supplemented today. Once this done, we could
                            start wheels moving in respect formalities and also practical
                            implementation and sooner this can be done the better.</p>
                        <p>To this <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> replied he assumed
                            “we will have to accept” but he would have to consult Prime Minister
                            first and would hope give me definitive answer some time next week. I
                            took precaution of inquiring whether prospective reply would be
                            definitive governmental position, referring in that connection to Sancar
                            letter. <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> said it would be
                            governmental position.</p>
                        <p>Later <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> telephoned to say had
                            acquainted Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>
                            with our discussion and would brief Turkish General Staff Monday, being
                            himself occupied tomorrow by presentation budget to Parliament.
                            Indicating also he had had some military contact he asked that 104–G
                            training team come immediately and be sure to bring trainer planes since
                            would be unable operate effectively otherwise. I suggested best reach
                            definitive basic decision first and then proceed action phase. However,
                            I would advise Washington of <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            interest in expediting training team in order that they might be alerted
                            for action. <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> said felt no
                            doubt as to outcome and would expect give me final reply shortly after
                            meeting with <gloss target="#t_TGS1">TGS</gloss>.</p>

                                regarding Defense Minister Sancar’s position on removal of the
                                Jupiter missiles. (Ibid.) In telegram 721, February 13, the
                                Department of State outlined the position it would take on Polaris
                                deployment if the issue were raised by the press. (Ibid., Def 12

                            <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> told me this morning that he

                                letter to <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> was
                                transmitted in telegram 943 from Ankara, February 13. While
                                accepting the U.S. proposal for Jupiter withdrawal, it raised a
                                number of issues of linkage between Jupiter withdrawal and supply

                            with <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> yesterday afternoon and
                            had suggested matter be withdrawn because of confusion it causing. In so
                            doing he presented my views on six numbered paragraphs of Sancar letter
                            and said they also <pb n="756" xml:id="pg_756" facs="0778"/>represented
                            his understanding of situation. At end of conversation <persName
                                corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> said he hesitated demand
                            retraction of letter for fear of hurting feelings of military but
                            suggested question might be resolved by making clear that points
                            specified by Sancar were not conditions but rather expression of Turkish
                            needs and desires.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> said he had agreed and said
                            he would see Sancar and then advise me. He doubted if he could do so
                            before first of next week due his own and Sancar’s immediate
                            preoccupation with budget presentation to House. However, he would do so
                            as soon as possible, using same arguments he had with <persName
                                corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> and hoping Sancar might actually
                            agree to revising letter. Meanwhile, however, it should be considered as
                            having status suggested by <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>.
                            He also expressed opinion that points raised by Sancar would not in any
                            event be appropriate for inclusion in bilateral agreement.</p>
                        <p>I observed this latter point very important since Sancar letter as
                            received had referred to possible “deadlocks” in implementation which I
                            could only interpret as suggesting removal Jupiters could be held up if
                            specified conditions not met. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of

                                >Erkin</persName> said Sancar had no authority impose such
                            conditions since decision exchange Polaris for Jupiters had been taken
                            by Cabinet and represented government position.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EF1">Erkin</persName> then inquired regarding

                            proposed going about it. I told him I was expecting information in this
                            regard momentarily and would get in touch with him as soon as it was
                            received. (<gloss target="#t_DEPTEL1">Deptel</gloss> 721 received after
                            this conversation.) In light foregoing, I agree with suggestion in

                                at least point out that military actions which we plan to begin in
                                April will take several months to complete (i.e., time needed for
                                training of crews before Turks can utilize fully 104s, et cetera),
                                and that delivery of bombs will be part of same general cycle of
                                development.</item>
                            <item>“Third”: We could remind Turks that TAF will be occupied some time
                                in absorbing 104 Squadrons now committed. Similarly we busy making
                                extensive preparations required consummate accelerated delivery

                                countries in order provide planes for Turkey. Therefore, we cannot
                                yet make promises for a third squadron, but TAF’s further
                                requirements will be in forefront our thinking as we plan

                                point does appear one area where US could make substantial

                        <p>In addition to questions raised these two letters, we should add anything
                            we can of positive nature to our presentation. For instance, in view
                            obstacles over Rota, use of Turkish base for Polaris, such as Marmaris,
                            could be very helpful in meeting our psychological problem as Foreign
                            Minister suggested to me. We did not actually use fall back position

                            thinking appeared then in process development but, if feasible, it might
                            still prove useful courtesy to offer even though it would by no means
                            fill Turk desire participation in Polaris system. Of more importance as
                            material demonstration our continued interest in Turk military
                            capability is possible formal offering of Hawk system to <gloss

                            CINCEUR is now appraising at Secretary Defense request. In other words,
                            we should offer all concrete indications of interest within our power at
                            this stage which will improve flavor of our general proposition.</p>
                        <p>We recommend reply to Sancar come to him from Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> since it now becoming clear
                            our difficulties are focused in <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_TGS1">TGS</gloss> and reply through less direct
                            method would be correspondingly less effective. Secondly, <gloss

                                <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> approach mark transition from
                            major decision which political in nature to implementation phase which,
                            though it has strong political implications, is military in essence.
                            However, in order avoid confusion of dual channels, I suggest reply be
                            forwarded to me for transmission Sancar through Foreign Minister.</p>
                        <p>We have been giving considerable thought over ways of meeting requirement
                            voiced by Sancar for negotiations between American and Turk delegates,
                            which in principle we believe may have merit. Personal discussions
                            covering Turkish military desires and our reaction to them in greater
                            depth than is possible by letter might clear air in <gloss
                                target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_TGS1">TGS</gloss>
                            which has now apparently become pretty cloudy. Such meeting would also
                            symbolize our continued interest in Turkish defense and give important
                            boost in right direction to detailed phase our negotiation and perhaps
                            play vital role in obtaining approval exchange of notes.</p>
                        <p>As regards location of meeting, we can see certain advantages in having
                            Turks go to Washington, but we believe <gloss target="#t_GOT1"
                                >GOT</gloss> would have difficulty sending anyone with sufficient
                            authority negotiate and in any case <pb n="760" xml:id="pg_760"
                                facs="0782"/>Turks would then have to come back with something quite
                            significant in hand. While visit of US official here would not eliminate
                            this problem, it would not arise in such compelling form, so that better
                            plan might be for senior <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> official,

                            to tell him about Turkey’s problems. The present Turkish Government was
                            a coalition of three parties, which he described. Turkey’s situation was
                            becoming more stabilized every day, even though coalition government was
                            a new thing (it was actually the second in modern Turkish history). The
                            Turks were also facing a new experience in planned economic life. The
                            Five Year Plan was in its first year. Planned economy was not easy to
                            run; there were difficulties—especially in external financing. However,
                            the Consortium had come through, with United States help.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d395fn1">At its July 5 meeting, the <gloss target="#t_OECD1"
                                    >OECD</gloss>’s Turkish Aid Consortium discussed increasing the

                                assisting Turkey to meet the goals of its Five-Year Plan.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AE1">Alican</persName> asked the President to help
                            continue the Consortium approach and resolution of such difficulties as
                            existed.</p>
                        <p>He stressed that Turkey’s very friendly feelings toward the United States
                            were from the people, from the nation itself, and not just the
                            government. Through all the events since May 1960, there had been no
                            change in the friendship of the Turkish people toward the American
                            people—no sign of animosity toward Americans. Turkey’s friendship came
                            from the nation itself.</p>
                        <p>Today Turkey was not hesitating at all in its basic political philosophy.
                            It was loyal to Western principles, and loyal to <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. But the economic problem remained—if
                            Turkey could get through the Five Year Plan successfully, everything
                            would go well. But if the Plan failed, there was trouble ahead. As to
                            internal financing, the Turks had made every sacrifice and met Plan
                            goals. They had levied 1.5 billion TL in new taxes in the first Plan
                            year. While they understood the difficulties facing their European and
                            American friends, they needed our help in the Consortium. Since things
                            were going a little slowly, they were spending their own reserves.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AE1">Alican</persName> said, “If the United
                            States supports us, the rest of the Consortium will too. The economic
                            problems of Turkey are vital in this phase of Turkish life; if the
                            Five-Year Plan is a success, Turkey will turn the corner.” The President
                            responded that “Our relations with Turkey are one of our strongest ties.
                            We regard Turkey as essential.” He commented that we had put a lot of
                            money into Turkey, but it was largely military aid, so the domestic
                            economy had not been able to expand very much. Therefore, the President
                            thought it proper we concentrate our energies on economic matters now.
                            Turkey had greater military security today than ever before. <persName

                            and at home. We had a hostage in Cuba—if he attacked elsewhere we could
                            do the same in Cuba. This did not mean we could relax. We had been close
                            to collision three times—Cuba, Laos, Berlin—in the last three years. The
                            President did not see much hope of a real detente, <pb n="762"

                            of Soviet attack. The United States was keeping our defenses strong, and
                            would continue to do so. Next year’s United States military budget would
                            be greater than this year’s. The President agreed with <persName
                                corresp="#p_AE1">Alican</persName> we should concentrate on the
                            economic front. Turkey should keep its guard up too, but the President
                            did not see much military threat. He did see other risks, however. The
                            Communists were still strong in Italy, there might be a popular front in
                            France after De Gaulle, the Communist Party was still strong in
                            Greece—here were the places where <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> could make trouble. Turkey had not had these
                            problems, but they might occur if the Turkish people did not begin to
                            see a better life.</p>
                        <p>The President then described his aid problems on Capitol Hill and the
                            likely cuts. He said we would still regard Turkey as a major recipient,
                            but we would not have the resources this year we had last year. We had
                            balance of payments problems too, though we could manage these over
                            time. In any case, our security commitment to Turkey was “strong”. We
                            saw it as the keystone of the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1"
                                >CENTO</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> system. We
                            would continue to work with the Consortium. We should maintain our
                            military strength but focus on the domestic economy. This was the most
                            important battle for the next few years. We had helped Turkey a lot,
                            especially militarily but had not helped much economically.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_AE1">Alican</persName> responded that United States
                            economic aid too had helped. Also military aid had helped Turkey avoid
                            trouble with small neighbors like Iraq and Syria. If Turkey could
                            improve its economic situation, its army would be maintained at its
                            present strong level. “Our most important program is the Five-Year Plan.
                            If it fails, the Turkish nation’s hopes will decline. We have accepted
                            economic planning, and are going for a 7% <gloss target="#t_GNP1"
                                >GNP</gloss> rise annually. We are trying to maintain a balance
                            between the developed parts of the country and the under-developed
                            eastern parts where Kurds live. The Five-Year Plan is vital to
                            Turkey.”</p>
                        <p>There followed some discussion of the problems Turkey confronted in the
                            Consortium. The $250 million first-year target had been met, but
                                <persName corresp="#p_AE1">Alican</persName> complained that the
                            terms offered by various Europeans were unsatisfactory. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Menemencioglu</persName> interjected that
                            Turkey would probably be unable to use some of the credits for this
                            reason. <persName corresp="#p_AE1">Alican</persName> concluded that for
                            1963 the Consortium contribution would be satisfactory but that this was
                            less likely for 1964. He urged our help with the Europeans, saying if
                            “the United States will support us, we will make it.”</p>
                        <p>The President assured <persName corresp="#p_AE1">Alican</persName>, “We
                            will work with you.” He said we too wished we could get the Europeans to
                            give better terms. We had had the same trouble in the Indian and
                            Pakistani cases; we would do the best we could. We thought Turkey was
                            essential. Our chief problem now was to get aid through Congress so we
                            could help. Our guarantees <pb n="763" xml:id="pg_763" facs="0785"/>were
                            strong and we were pretty sure we could avoid war, so we should give
                            emphasis to economic problems. We would maintain our strength because
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was out to cause
                            us what trouble he could. <persName corresp="#p_AE1">Alican</persName>
                            wished the President every success in this endeavor.</p>

                        <p>In a conversation marked by warmth of mutual confidence and respect, the
                            principal exchanges were, in paraphrase, as follows:</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>: It is a great
                            tribute to you as well as to the late President that you have come on
                            this sad occasion. There is no one of the 92 representatives here I more
                            appreciate having come than you, not only because of my great regard for
                            your leadership, loyalty and convictions, but also because of our great
                            affection for the Turkish people. We face many difficult problems, which
                            seem to be constantly arising, but I am happy that we are resolving them
                            together.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>: This great
                            tragedy that has befallen the American nation has caused deep grief to
                            the entire Turkish people. The sentiment dominant in Turkey now is to
                            share your grief and to feel that if there are any duties we can carry
                            we should be ready at this moment.</p>
                        <pb n="764" xml:id="pg_764" facs="0786"/>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>: I am grateful.
                            That sentiment would be typical of the Turks and we know this to be your
                            feeling.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>: I am aware
                            that the entire world is represented here this moment and how busy you
                            are. It is with great gratitude that I am received by you and I will
                            tell the Turkish people of your kindness.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>: I could not let
                            you go back home without seeing you because I need the inspiration I
                            always get from the Turks. One of the most stimulating experiences of my
                            life was the reception given to me in Turkey. My feeling for Turkey has
                            been of long duration. I was one of the first Congressmen, as a young
                            man, to go into the well of the House to speak in support of the Truman
                            Doctrine.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>: The fact that
                            you have such contacts with the Turks is a source of consolation and
                            confidence to us. Your visit is still warmly remembered.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>: I was quite
                            concerned when we started talking about the removal of the Jupiters last
                            year for fear the Turks would worry, but I became convinced that the new
                            arrangements would give you more modern protection and thus would be
                            good for the people for whom I have such high respect. We realize that a
                            great deal must still be done by your people but I want you to know that
                            our commitments are complete and will be respected.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>: In our
                            foreign policy Turkey has a series of commitments but for us the basis
                            and cornerstone of them all is our close alliance with the United
                            States. It is true we have had internal discussions and divergences in
                            recent years. This can happen in any country. What is important and
                            unshakable in our national life is what I have just mentioned to you.
                            Whatever Government there may be in Turkey, its basis will be close
                            association with the United States.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>: I am confident
                            the same is true of the United States. This Administration ends in
                            January 1965. But whatever administration there may be, our friendship
                            and alliance with you would be American foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>: The second
                            point I wish to express is that so far as our internal situation goes
                            the one most important matter is the economic situation. The question of
                            economic betterment is a vital problem for us. I beg of you to pay
                            attention to this concern of ours.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>: I certainly
                            will, and you may be sure that we will do what we can, within the limits
                            of what Congress permits. You know that we have the same problems in our
                            country as you have in yours. Foreign aid has been going on for 17
                            years, taxes are high—as high as 90% for some, the people are tired, and
                            we have our difficulties. But we also know that no one is participating
                            in our common efforts more <pb n="765" xml:id="pg_765" facs="0787"
                            />strongly than the Turks, and we are glad. You have come to see me in
                            good company, with one of my dearest friends, <persName
                                corresp="#p_HWA1">Averell Harriman</persName>. If there is any
                            detail of these problems that you wish to bring to our attention,
                            mention them to Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>
                            and we will try to do something about them. I hope you may come again to
                            see us.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>: Thank you.
                            That will be a fine day.</p>

                                    or Turkey would be met with conventional forces but questioned
                                    whether conventional response would be adequate if Turkey

                                    seemed designed to destroy Constitution, which recognized 2

                                    because Turks had no intention of changing any of her
