<head>Preface</head>
<p>The publication <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> constitutes the official record of the foreign policy of the United States. The volumes in the series include, subject to necessary security considerations, all documents needed to give a comprehensive record of the major foreign policy decisions of the United States together with appropriate materials concerning the facts which contributed to the formulation of policies. Documents in the files of the Department of State are supplemented by papers from other Government agencies involved in the formulation of foreign policy.</p>
<p>The basic documentary diplomatic record printed in the volumes of the series <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> is edited by the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, Department of State. The editing is guided by the principles of historical objectivity and and in accordance with the following official guidance first promulgated by Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925.</p>
<p>There may be no alteration of the text, no deletions without indicating where in the text the deletion is made, and no omission of facts which were of major importance in reaching a decision. Nothing may be omitted for the purpose of concealing or glossing over what might be regarded by some as a defect of policy. However, certain omissions of documents are permissible for the following reasons:</p>
<list>
<item>a. To avoid publication of matters which would tend to impede current diplomatic negotiations or other business.</item>
<item>b. To condense the record and avoid repetition of needless details.</item>
<item>c. To preserve the confidence reposed in the Department by individuals and by foreign governments.</item>
<item>d. To avoid giving needless offense to other nationalities or individuals.</item>
<item>e. To eliminate personal opinions presented in despatches and not acted upon by the Department. To this consideration there is one qualification—in connection with major decisions it is desirable, where possible, to show the alternative presented to the Department before the decision was made.</item>
</list>
<p>Documents selected for publication in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes are referred to the Department of State Classification/Declassification Center for declassification clearance. The Center reviews the documents, makes declassification decisions, and obtains the clearance of geographic and functional bureaus of the Department of State, as well as of other appropriate agencies of the government.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_IV" n="IV" facs="0008"/>
<p>The Center, in coordination with the geographic bureaus of the Department of State, conducts communications with foreign governments regarding documents or information of those governments proposed for inclusion in <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes.</p>
<p>Edward C. Keefer and David W. Mabon of the Office of The Historian compiled and edited this volume under the supervision of John P. Glennon. Lynn Chase and Rosa Pace prepared the lists of sources, names, and abbreviations. Carol A. Becker and Kay Herring supervised the preparation of the full text database and conversion to 9-track magnetic tape from which the volume was typeset.</p>
<p>This is the first volume published in the new <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> format designed jointly by the Government Printing Office and the Department of State. Sidney K. Nichols, Senior Applications Specialist in the Graphic Systems Development Divison of GPO, developed the computer typesetting format.</p>
<p>Rita M. Baker performed technical editing in the Publishing Services Division (Paul M. Washington, Chief). The Twin Oaks Indexing Collective prepared the index.</p>

<p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General</persName>: I have been hoping to find time to write you a letter about a few things that are better expressed in this manner than by telegram.</p>
<p>First, I can hardly convey the sense of reassurance and appreciation which your efforts have created in Washington. Your telegrams are followed closely and discussed in all the agencies, in all the departments and at all levels. We like the hard-hitting, businesslike approach of your seven-point program.<note n="3" xml:id="d1fn3"><p>On December 13, 1954, Generals <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> signed for their respective countries a memorandum of understanding on development and training of autonomous Vietnamese armed forces. The memorandum consisted of seven paragraphs which are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>I. Subject to American approval, the Vietnamese force structure to be attained by July 1, 1955 to total 77,685 military and 4,000 civilian personnel.</p>
<p>II. Reduction to this level by selective discharge of the least effective personnel of the Vietnamese National Army (<gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss>).</p>
<p>III. Full autonomy (all units in the <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> commanded and staffed by Vietnamese personnel) to be granted by France to South Vietnam not later than July 1, 1955.</p>
<p>IV. Responsibility for assisting South Vietnam in organizing and training its armed forces to be assumed by the Chief, U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group(<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>) under the overall authority of the French Commander-in-Chief in Indochina.</p>
<p>V. Chief, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> to recognize this authority in strategic and security matters.</p>
<p>VI. U.S. and French personnel assigned as advisers and instructors to the <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> to be under the direction of the Chief, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>.</p>
<p>VII. These arrangements and agreements to be subject to the consent of the Government of Vietnam.</p>
<p>For the complete text of this memorandum and an accompanying memorandum for the record, see telegram 2261, December 14, 1954, <ref target="frus1952-54v13p2"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, vol. XIII, Part 2</ref>, p. 2366.</p></note></p>
<pb xml:id="pg_2" n="2" facs="0032"/>
<p>The big problem is still effective leadership in Viet-Nam. I realize <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s deficiencies in providing dynamic, positive, dramatic energy and force at a time when it is so desperately needed. This is the one component above all that no foreign country or external aid program can supply. A country either has a leader and a unified following or it doesn’t. My own thinking is that time may evolve a leadership group in Viet-Nam if there is time. Sometimes under pressure nations like people rise to unknown heights. It is too early to tell whether there is any hope in Viet-Nam for this larger dimension and stature. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is a good man and a resonant untarnished symbol of Nationalism. That is a precious ingredient. With it we can perhaps appeal to the Vietnamese people in the north and in the south to rally behind an effective government in a program of national reform. It could spike the Communist propaganda guns. It could attract the support and assistance of our other Asian friends. So many Asian representatives in Washington have told me how glad they are the United States is supporting <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and not some puppet or profiteer.</p>
<p>As a practical matter the government of a national union around <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is a good formula if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> can bring in a few strong competent men like <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>. We here in the Department have thought of this formula as meaning <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would concentrate primarily on serving as spokesman and voice for Free Vietnamese Nationalists. The running of the government would be left to something of an executive vice president who might be <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>, in charge of key ministries such as defense, interior, national economy, etc. An emergency council or national council would frame up the major policy decisions for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s approval. You know the obstacles to this better than I do—the jockeying for power and the jealous rivalries.</p>
<p>In any event it seems to me that the question of succession as well as the problem of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> can best be handled if originated out of genuine Vietnamese impulses. The problem we have had with the French regarding <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> for the past three months is primarily to avoid a political crisis and the selection of a successor which would appear dictated by the French. In my opinion, the promptings for the new premier would be more effective if arising from the Vietnamese themselves—perhaps with discreet proddings here and there, if the time ever comes.</p>
<p>For the moment the Department fully agrees that the time has not yet come to consider actively the question of succession. Some of us are keeping it in the back of our minds and studying possibilities amongst ourselves, I assure you. Of course Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> believes that there isn’t much else besides <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and the process of replacement would create far more chaos and confusion than is even present today in Free Viet-Nam.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_3" n="3" facs="0033"/>
<p>I would like to continue this letter just a little longer to refer to recent press items about your discussions with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName>. Most of this has been dribbling out since <persName corresp="#p_MFP1">Mendes-France</persName> came to Washington. The press got the first notion of our general approach from French background briefings during his visit to Washington. But nothing much appeared at that time. Then there were a few articles in the Paris press on the Vietnamese force levels. The whole business came to a head in the article in the <hi rend="italic">U.S. News &amp; World Report</hi> dated December 10 entitled “U.S. Inherits Another Headache—French Turns Over Indo-China Job to America”. This gave figures substantially accurate, and an account of US-French exchange of views embarrassingly complete. About the time this appeared, the <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> correspondent came in to see me with a cable from the <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> office in Paris along the same line as the <hi rend="italic">U.S. News &amp; World Report</hi> article. I was informed that the Paris office had received the story from French sources.</p>
<p>We have, of course, tried to keep the security questions under close wraps and are just as concerned and even shocked as you probably are to have this all out in public print before the programs are completed. The hard-bitten fellows around here shrugged their shoulders and said “that’s what always happens with the French”.</p>
<p>In closing, may I earnestly ask that you let me know by letter or otherwise whether or not we are giving you adequate backstopping here in Washington. Please let me know how we can improve our help to you.</p>
<p>With very best wishes,</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<dateline><hi rend="italic"><placeName>Saigon</placeName>, <date when="1955-01-03">January 3, 1955</date></hi>.</dateline>
<p>1. Here is some New Year’s thinking about the problem you and we face, and a request.</p>
<p>2. As a start, it is worth taking a look at the real value of the chips given to you by President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> for the game we are <pb xml:id="pg_4" n="4" facs="0034"/>playing here. The chips are our direct aid to the Vietnamese. To most Americans, they mean money, material, and technical (advisory) manpower. In the eyes of the world, and especially Asia, they mean something more. In this view, the value of the chips becomes Asia itself and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>3. The Asian view is that “direct aid” means that Communism’s strongest enemy, the United States, is now in close support of the Free Vietnamese against the Communists. Certainly each of the free nations which has a pact with the United States, in which we will give them close support against the Communists, sees a bit of itself in the situation of the Vietnamese. And, each of those nations, in varying degree, will be measuring what our support actually means. Thus, if we lose here or withdraw however gracefully, politically powerful people in those nations will read their own futures into our action. This means that the do-business-with-China folks of Japan, the anti-American-bases folks of the Philippines, and so on, will find their arguments strengthened locally to the critical strain point for the United States in places we now find difficult enough under neutralist and Communist political pressures. This is far beyond the usual observation of the loss of Vietnam opening Southeast Asia to the impact of Communist dynamism, which is dangerous enough in itself.</p>
<p>4. Thus, I feel that we have too much to lose to consider loosing [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] or withdrawing. We have no other choice but to win here or face an increasingly grim future, a heritage which none of us wants to pass along to our offspring.</p>
<p>5. What will it take to win? It is going to take everything we are now doing and planning to do, plus more—and I believe that the “more” now exists here as a potential awaiting proper employment.</p>
<p>6. I have narrowed down the elements we need for winning the present struggle here to three, which is perhaps over-simplifying. I believe that if we can make these three elements a reality here, the initiative will pass to us and we will start winning. I feel, further, that we must have clear evidence by June 1955 that we can make the three elements a reality. They are:</p>
<list>
<item>a. Successful teamwork</item>
<item>b. Strengthen the free Vietnamese</item>
<item>c. Make the bulk of the population willing to risk all for freedom</item>
</list>
<p>7. <hi rend="italic">Successful teamwork</hi>. The enemy is enjoying considerable success in his teamwork, among the Vietminh, between Vietminh and supporting population, and between Chinese advisors and Vietminh. We have a distance to go before we can match this teamwork, even among us Americans here, for several reasons (including the slower <pb xml:id="pg_5" n="5" facs="0035"/>progress of our type of discipline as compared to the “iron discipline” of the Communists). Competent friendly observers have told me of dangerous frictions existing among key members of the U.S. team here; perhaps the root cause of such friction is that we still are not in agreement on exactly what the U.S. wants to achieve here regardless of risk, exactly how to achieve such result, and exactly who will undertake specific parts of the whole mission.<note n="2" xml:id="d2fn2">The following handwritten marginal note by <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> appears beside the second and third sentences of this paragraph: “Rumors from newspapermen based on cocktail stories. <gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss>”</note> This root cause undoubtedly is fertilized by any personal antipathies arising out of the strains we have all been under in trying so hard to solve problems here. Most of these frictions can be eased through the mechanisms you have established already.</p>
<p>8. Our teamwork with the French, as fellow westerners in an Asian area, has progressed well despite many handicaps.<note n="3" xml:id="d2fn3"><persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ following handwritten marginal note appears beside the first sentence of this paragraph: “Not so. <gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss>”</note> However, this teamwork has grown more and more into a secretly tripartite type of working arrangement, in practice we incorporate a substantial amount of French thinking in our plans and advice, rather than the bipartite working arrangement originally described by you and as our public policy, wherein we inform the French of our intents, then take the matter up with the Vietnamese. This can lead to the same mistakes being made in all major fields which helped weaken the free world’s position here prior to Geneva, by causing the adoption of methods which offer prime targets to the Communists in promulgating their “total-mass protracted resistance”. I feel that we must not visibly help extend French influence into areas of present non-influence; we must be steadfast to our own principles which gave us strength while being the friendly ally. Perhaps some handicaps to our teamwork with the French could be overcome if a mechanism were constructed to nullify the rumors which course through French circles re U.S. intents here.</p>
<p>9. A great deal of thought and effort has been given to our teamwork with the Vietnamese. However, there still seems to be some confusion on our part between partisanship and desired objectives, capabilities of the Vietnamese, and the most rewarding methods of doing business with them. There seems to be an increasing suspicion of our good intentions and ability to help successfully, which if it grows unchecked can endanger our whole effort here; an intensification of personal contacts all down the line of the American team with individual Vietnamese, on a footing of equality, and with patient explanation of reasons for requests or advice, would help. We must hold and extend our friendships among the Vietnamese, in <pb xml:id="pg_6" n="6" facs="0036"/>order to give successful meaning to our aid, since we are now looked upon as the only strong true friend of Vietnam (other than China and the Soviets) and probably are the only catalysts who can induce the Vietnamese on our side to unify.</p>
<p>10. Teamwork among the Free Vietnamese has progressed slowly. There is still too much partisanship, distrust, and obstructive jealousy. Prominent among the remedies for this complex trouble are: growth of effective people–government–army cooperation, hope of establishment of some form of representative government which the people and factions of people feel honestly represents [them], and, perhaps, development of political techniques among leaders (apt bestowal of praise, interest in individual welfare, informing the people adequately of the state of the nation with emphasis on plus factors, and so on).</p>
<p>11. <hi rend="italic">Strengthening Vietnamese</hi>. I am concerned about whether all our aid and efforts here will strengthen the Vietnamese or merely make them more dependent upon us. Certainly none of us who must justify actions eventually at home would desire to place the U.S. in the position of continuing major help here for endless years, on the basis that if our aid were lessened then the enemy would win. Certainly the responsible Americans here would like to see the Vietnamese capably assuming an increasing share of their own burdens in all fields of national life.</p>
<p>12. Thus, I would like to see our efforts here geared as completely as possible to the operating philosophy of helping the Vietnamese to help themselves, not only Vietnamese government or army, but the people themselves. It will mean insisting on more extensive and effective use of our help by the Vietnamese—and our acceptance of workable Vietnamese standards rather than our own perhaps to a greater extent. This will increase proprietary interest in what is constructed (whether it be army division or individual farm), build the muscularity of national abilities, and start giving the Free Vietnamese the confidence in their own competence which the Vietminh have demonstrated so remarkably on their side. These are all factors of strength in a struggle with the Communists. It is also true that a man is more apt to defend what he has constructed for himself—and we will strengthen the Free Vietnamese as we increase the size or amount of what they want to defend from the Communists.</p>
<p>13. <hi rend="italic">Willingness to risk all for freedom</hi>. Mao Tse-tung once clearly expressed a basic fact in the type of struggle we are now engaged in here by stating: “There is no possibility for it (he was speaking of guerrilla warfare) to survive and develop once it is cut loose from the people or fails to attract the participation and co-operation of the broad masses”. The Vietminh have learned this lesson well, applied it in their military guerrilla warfare prior to the Cease-Fire, and are <pb xml:id="pg_7" n="7" facs="0037"/>now applying it south of the 17th Parallel in their political guerrilla warfare. Our defeat is certain unless we learn and apply this same lesson of today’s warfare, and do so more effectively than the enemy. We must face up to the fact our side was “cut loose from the people” in too many areas we must now win back, and our method of winning them back must be to attract their participation and co-operation in what we free people do and cherish, not force, scare or coerce, but attract.</p>
<p>14. How do we attract people to our side, hold them, and develop in them a willingness to risk their lives and fortunes if need be for liberty or freedom? Our approach, and the approach of all forces and organizations on our side, must be as friends (not as bossy supervisors, not as cops as envisioned in the so-called “pacification” plans produced under the influence of 1946–53 here, not as dressed-up speechmakers appearing briefly before the “peasants”, not as purveyors of masses of printed arguments to the illiterate).</p>
<p>15. If the entire team on our side makes the right approach to the people, we will have taken the first major step in attracting people to our side. We must then set about convincing, and accomplishment is most convincing, the people that their own future (and that of their children and children’s children) will be more rewarding under our system than under Communism—more rewarding politically or socially, economically, and spiritually. When the hope of such a rewarding future is raised within the people, coupled with hope of its possible attainment (which includes military means to protect the attainment), then the first big cleavage between the Communists and the bulk of the population will start taking place.</p>
<p>16. Much of the program you outlined soon after your arrival here as Ambassador is intended to establish and protect a rewarding future for the Free Vietnamese. However, a critical piece appears to be missing: giving the people a truly representative government. This must be keyed around a charter or constitution which sets forth plainly how the people have their own government and a bill of rights. A national assembly or congress would fail to satisfy an urgent need unless it were pointing towards the writing and adoption of a constitution in the soonest possible future. The Vietminh have beaten us at this basic national principle of ours (proof again of the skill of the Vietminh enemy) and even rubbed our noses in the beating by generous use of verbiage from the U.S. Constitution. Our strong point is that their document does not do what the constitution of a free people can—and the sooner we have such a document, the sooner we can start making this plain to the people. The political hazards of getting such a document are considerable, but these hazards must be risked and can be kept to a minimum by adroit tactical development.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_8" n="8" facs="0038"/>
<p>17. Along with moving as rapidly as possible towards a Constitution, the Free Vietnamese must establish government and the benefits of government as rapidly as possible throughout Vietnam south of the 17th Parallel. This is what we have termed “national action”, of which military “pacification” is an integral part. It is the approach to the people and the first means of raising hopes within them, as mentioned in paragraph 15 before. Neither Vietnamese government operations currently on “national action”, nor U.S. actions to help, are too well coordinated today. Which brings me to my request.</p>
<p>18. <hi rend="italic">Request</hi>. It is requested that you bring about a coordination of the efforts of our entire team, starting with the U.S. team and, through them, the Vietnamese and French, in the fields of “national action”. As a member of your personal staff, I would like to devote the major share of my time as your deputy or assistant or staff member in such coordination work. Officers associated with me are capable of effective help in this field. We would be able to re-commence the meetings formerly held by us which had made a good start towards a workable operation, in conjunction with all interested U.S. and Vietnamese agencies. This time, we could add the French, if desired.<note n="4" xml:id="d2fn4">The following handwritten marginal note by <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> appears beside paragraph 18: “Designated <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName> to coordinate our phases of program under <persName corresp="#p_OD1">Gen. O’Daniel</persName>’s direction. <gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss>”</note></p>
<p>19. The basis for my request is that I believe I can help you most in this way and that I have recently had three years’ experience in a similar field under similar conditions. Neither I nor any officers associated with me are seeking more work or to deter or detract from the work of others. We do seek the opportunity to come to firm grips with a most pressing problem and to help the rest of the U.S. team in their work on it. This we cannot do unless given the mission by you.</p>

<p>1. Reference telegrams (a) and (b) reflect what I believe to be misunderstanding regarding <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> memo of understanding. It was never my intention that memo of understanding itself would be submitted to Vietnamese Government. I made such statement to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> in unequivocal terms, and it was my understanding that he agreed. Our intention was that memo would be strictly bilateral arrangement between us, and as such need not be shown to Vietnam Government. Last paragraph of understanding was included in attempt to avoid offending Vietnamese sensibilities should text of understanding become known, since in any case cooperation of Vietnam Government in program affecting its forces is essential to success.</p>
<p>2. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and I discussed problem of how best to approach <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. We were in general accord that program for support and training of Vietnam forces should not be presented to him as fait accompli in form of prior US-French agreement, but as reasonable proposal that justified his support. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> generally agreed with my suggestion that announcement of agreed program of US and French support for reorganization and training of Vietnam forces should come from <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> himself in manner designed to enable him to get credit for enlisting French and US aid in strengthening Vietnam Armed Forces.</p>
<p>3. It appears to me that French idea of redrafting understanding in form of French-US recommendations to be made to Vietnam Government suffers same objections as would presentation of understanding in its present form, since joint recommendations would have had to be agreed upon by France and US in advance of their submission to Vietnamese. Furthermore, force structure as contained in annex to understanding has already been made available to Vietnamese. I have discussed it with <persName>Minh</persName> as has <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName> and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, and Vietnamese General Staff has it under study.</p>
<p>4.

<p>598. Brief end December survey Hanoi political situation follows:</p>
<p>(1) Presence Viet Minh army still dominated Hanoi scene with sentries, patrols and various troop formations much in evidence. Preparations for celebration national resistance anniversary (December 19), birthday of army (December 22) and mass demonstration anticipated for end of month brought many people into city from outlying areas. There was lavish and expensive preparation of “Red Square”. Streets were decorated and illuminated especially around Petit Lac. Flags and triumphal arches again appeared. There was much preoccupation with anti-American propaganda in form of press and radio attacks and meetings of various groups to denounce alleged US intention destroy Geneva agreement. At same time official attitude of friendliness towards French became apparent in official pronouncement meeting general press and radio coverage. Near end of month there was much drilling and marching in streets by school children and occupational groups in preparation for mass demonstration. Consulate learned that political indoctrination of school children and workers at telephone and electric companies was being stepped up. Nevertheless there was no tangible evidence of any anti-American feeling among population in general. There were several instances of insolent and provocative behavior by military sentinels towards American personnel but other foreigners experienced similar treatment. Curfew was suspended on Christmas Eve and on New Years Eve. Usual propaganda trappings such as posters, flags and banderoles were widely disseminated. Food stores carried wide variety <pb xml:id="pg_11" n="11" facs="0041"/>Russian, Chinese and Viet Minh Communist propaganda including some English language pamphlets.</p>
<p>(2) Hanoi Military and Administrative Committee while still officially running city seemed to fade into background while its subordinate administrative committee, an all civilian unit, assumed more prominence. <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho</persName>, Dong, <persName corresp="#p_VNG1">Giap</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HMG1">Giam</persName> made more frequent public appearances and it seemed likely that some <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> government departments had set up branches in city. French and other observers still reported Viet Minh display of inefficiency in coping with problems of city administration but on surface at least local authorities discharged basic municipal functions of traffic police, water, light and power supply and street cleaning et cetera in effective manner. Have not solved foreign exchange problem on regular basis and their finances reported to be in chaotic state. All French technicians except those attached in managerial capacity to Pasteur and cancer institutes, cliniques Saint Paul, Tramway Company and faculty Lycee Albert Sarraut and some at university reported to have left. However there were no confirmed reports that Communist foreign aid had replaced French technicians in any capacities.</p>
<p>(3) Strictness Viet Minh security measures was not relaxed and in some instances seemed to have been tightened. There was closer military surveillance of <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> occupied buildings and there appeared to be closer police coverage of city’s outskirts. Police surveillance American and British Consulates became less ostentatious but no less effective. Actions military sentries seemed arbitrary and capricious perhaps reflecting lack of indoctrination in responsibilities and principles. At different times I have been saluted, ignored or threatened with weapons by sentries. Vietnamese and <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> personnel in center of town frequently ignored curfew without difficulty but even <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> personnel had difficulty in more remote parts of city. Army and police patrol coverage of city at night continued and restrictions on travel outside remained in force.</p>
<p>(4) Certain stresses and strains were increasingly evident within <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and even within Indian delegation. <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> prepared interim report as of end December for presentation to co-chairmen Geneva Conference. Report as finally approved represented compromise conflicting views three members. . . . We had the impression that Canadians always friendly but sometimes over cautious about offending Viet Minh had taken extra pains during Christmas season to demonstrate friendliness for American Consulate.</p>
<p>(5) Polish and Czech Ambassadors arrived to join Communist diplomatic corps. Although <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s continued occupy secondary place after Russians as far as Viet Minh propaganda concerned they stole limelight for few days with announcement Sino-Viet Minh accord for <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> aid in reconstruction railroad, highway, airport <pb xml:id="pg_12" n="12" facs="0042"/>and telecommunications facilities. Agreement received only moderate propaganda treatment and we were able to get little comment from foreign observers. We believe it one of most significant developments since armistice since, in principle at least, it represented projection of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> military power well into North Vietnam.</p>
<p>(6) There was general agreement that first phase of <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> mission<note n="2" xml:id="d4fn2">For documentation on the <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> Mission to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, see <ref target="frus1952-54v13p2"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, vol. XIII, Part 2</ref>, pp. 1948 ff.</note> had ended with signature December 10 accords. Tangible achievements this mission remained negligible so far as protection French economic interests concerned since Viet Minh made no real concessions to French other than those that would fit into general Communist propaganda campaign of “peaceful co-existence”. However, <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> did succeed in laying groundwork for further Franco-Viet Minh negotiations on superficial basis of friendship and equality. Most French firms in Haiphong had not yet decided whether or not to seek specific arrangements with Viet Minh under terms December 10 accords. Probably awaiting outcome talks between Charbonnages Tonkin and Viet Minh. <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> presented credentials in form of letter from French Prime Minister to <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> Prime Minister. Whatever legalistic quibbling French may do concerning nature these credentials he became to all intents and purposes diplomatic representative of French Government to <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and functioned openly as such. (Received formal visit from Soviet Ambassador and paid formal visit to Foreign Minister.) <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName>, his Chef de Cabinet and his financial expert are all now in Paris. It is generally believed <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> will return near end January with French Government instructions concerning next phase his operations.</p>
<p>(7) British ConGen’s position became more regularized. He established fairly frequent courier service to and from Haiphong and travelled to Hong Kong and Saigon. Local authorities officially entertained him and invited him to public ceremony. Same applies Indian consular agent. Apostolic Delegate continued remain as inconspicuous as possible although he flew papal colors Christmas Day.</p>
<p>(8) Press and radio gave primary attention to campaign against US intention destroy Geneva Agreement by building up power national government Vietnam in Saigon. Campaign [garble] to be building up to mass demonstration scheduled for January 1.<note n="3" xml:id="d4fn3">A report on this demonstration is in telegram 597 from Hanoi, January 3. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/1–355)</note> Secondary theme was US “incitement” evacuation Catholic population to south.</p>
<p>(9) Conclusion: In general Viet Minh appeared to be going ahead with consolidation their control and with imposition rigid Communist indoctrination and regimentation. There was some evidence administrative <pb xml:id="pg_13" n="13" facs="0043"/>inefficiency stemming from lack of experience large scale problems. Regime seemed to have encountered no popular opposition of any government except that offered by Vietnamese Catholics who continued evacuation south despite Viet Minh appeals and in face many obstacles. Power structure of regime continued to be subject of speculation, largely based on guesswork, by foreign observers.

Soutou predicated this conclusion on premise that if we wished avoid general elections 1956 then it necessary to develop strength in South Vietnam and this only possible by having “left wing” Vietnamese govt prepared embark on imaginative and bold reform programs etc. Soutou’s statement compares with Clarac’s<note n="4" xml:id="d5fn4">Cabinet Director for <persName corresp="#p_LCGC1">Guy La Chambre</persName>, Minister for the Associated States.</note> statement to us to effect that Fr Govt prefers see emergence “more moderate” Vietnamese govt in South and one less openly anti-Vietminh (para 4 <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 2761<note n="5" xml:id="d5fn5"><p>Paragraph 4 of this telegram, dated December 30, 1954, reads as follows:</p>
<p>“Clarac then proceeded to say that while they under no illusions concerning longer term possibilities of doing business with Vietminh, they thought <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> effort worthwhile if only to gain time in terms one to two years in which shore up Cambodia and Laos. Clarac admitted, however, that <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> approach in North in conflict with present manifest anti-Commie line taken by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> govt in South and the position taken by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> on this score made <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName>’s job in North that much more difficult. We said, however, that if firm anti-Commie position to be taken in South, it would appear to be evident that one could hardly lend support or encouragement at same time to <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> line in North. Clarac said he recognized this fundamental conflict and said this in part why French prefer see emergence ‘more moderate’ Vietnamese Govt in South and one less openly anti-Vietminh. He added that if stronger govt could be formed in South, it could be expected exert moderating influence on Vietminh as well as on outcome elections. We said it because we concerned over possible emergence Vietnamese Govt in South likely move parallel to rather than against, <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> line in North that we found it difficult to accept fully French insistence <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> be replaced. We said we aware conflict between policy symbolized by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and that by <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName>, however, to adopt an approach that would tend to lessen this conflict seemed, for the present at least, to run counter Free World’s desire maintain Free Vietnam and would appear involve basic US appraisal [<hi rend="italic">reappraisal</hi>] its approach Vietnam. Clarac’s only comment this score was to state that it better maneuver for time in Vietnam and try at all costs not to drive Vietminh into arms Chinese Commies and Soviets, and to use time thus gained to build up strength Laos and Cambodia.” (Department of State, Central Files, 451.51G31/12–3050)</p></note>).</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_14" n="14" facs="0044"/>
<p>We inclined think that a “left-wing” Vietnamese govt such as that envisaged by Soutou, which presumably would be headed by personality such as Buu Hoi, would most likely move parallel with rather than counter to Vietminh govt. Such a development in our view likely to lead some form rapprochement between North and South Vietnam prior holding July 1956 elections, thus making question latter largely academic.</p>

<p>2562. 1. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has confirmed to <persName corresp="#p_FWR1">Fishel</persName> statement <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Luyen</persName> made to me ten days ago that government would not extend Binh Xuyen gambling and other concessions when contract expires January 15. We have had some reports, so far unconfirmed, that Binh Xuyen are preparing to sabotage public utilities Saigon if contract is not renewed.</p>
<p>2. <persName corresp="#p_DJH1">Daridan</persName> came to see me today. He had heard same rumors and said French were disturbed by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s intention not renew contract because of threat to public order at a time when 14,000 Vietnamese civilians have been on strike against French Army for six weeks. <persName corresp="#p_DJH1">Daridan</persName> said that strikers who have thus far been peaceable are now threatening to take “direct action”.</p>
<p>3. <persName corresp="#p_DJH1">Daridan</persName> said that he and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> both believe that strikers’ claims are in large measure justified, and that with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s backing he has <pb xml:id="pg_15" n="15" facs="0045"/>asked French Government make available 800 million francs to settle dispute. I suggested, that in the interests of avoiding what might be serious trouble and in order not to dissuade <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> from his firm stand, it might be desirable for US to support <persName corresp="#p_DJH1">Daridan</persName>’s request for funds through Embassy Paris. <persName corresp="#p_DJH1">Daridan</persName> agreed.</p>
<p>4. Since there is some basis for French concern over Vietnam Army capacity to handle both strikers and Binh Xuyen without police support I recommend Department instruct Embassy Paris to inform Foreign Office we take serious view of continuing strike as added threat to security of free Vietnam and hope that French Government takes prompt steps to settle it.</p>
<p>5. In this connection I told <persName corresp="#p_DJH1">Daridan</persName> that if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> were forced to temporize with Binh Xuyen with respect to contract renewal, Prime Minister would probably suffer serious reversal in obtaining agreement of <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> and Hoa Hao to the gradual elimination of their private armies and their cooperation in a land-reform program.</p>

<p>The Special <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> Working Group on Indochina held its meeting<note n="2" xml:id="d7fn2">Reports of other meetings of the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> Working Group on Indochina are <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> Southeast Asia.</note> yesterday at the Pentagon to hear a <gloss target="#t_G21">G–2</gloss> briefing on military situation in Communist Viet-Nam and Free Viet-Nam. This memorandum summarizes the highlights.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_16" n="16" facs="0046"/>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">1. The Viet Minh</p>
<p>Communist military capabilities have substantially increased since the Geneva Accord was signed July 21, 1954. At that time the Viet Minh regular army consisted of seven divisions and a large number of independent battalions and auxiliary guerrilla groups. The size of the regular army was approximately 145,000 out of 330,000, or approximately 40% of the total Viet Minh strength last July. Today there are eleven divisions which constitute 230,000 men out of 335,000, or roughly two-thirds. The regular army has increased nearly 100,000 in men.</p>
<p><gloss target="#t_G21">G–2</gloss> estimates that there has already been an unprecedented increase in fire power. There has been a six-fold increase in artillery fire power during the past year. The equipment has come in from China before and after the Geneva Accord on a large scale. It continues to move into North Viet-Nam but there has been a perceptible reduction recently. Most of the military equipment is Russian, Czech or Eastern European. The Chinese Communists have supplied sixty-m.m. mortars and seventy-six-m.m. guns manufactured by them in Manchuria.</p>
<p>Nine of the eleven Viet Minh divisions are in the general Hanoi area. One division is near the demilitarized zone. There are no indications as yet that Viet Minh divisions have moved towards the demilitarized line. The whole emphasis during the past six months has been on standardization and a shift away from guerrilla type organization. There is no visible or potential threat to the Viet Minh in North Viet-Nam at this time.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">2. French Expeditionary Corps</p>
<p>French forces have decreased from 175,000 to approximately 125,000 as of December 31, 1954. However, the bulk of this reduction has been in the transfer of Vietnamese soldiers to the Vietnamese National Army. Only some 10 to 15,000 French soldiers have so far been repatriated to metropolitan France, according to <gloss target="#t_G21">G–2</gloss>.</p>
<p>40,000 French forces remain in the Haiphong area. In the south there are two divisions in the Saigon area, one division next to the demilitarized zone and one in the Tourane area a bit south of the zone.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">3. The Vietnamese National Army</p>
<p>At the time of the cease-fire this army had about 210,000 soldiers. It now numbers about 145,000 plus some 35,000 auxiliaries of nondescript character. This 145,000 also includes some 30 to 40,000 Vietnamese troops sifted from the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>. Thus the absolute decrease in the Vietnamese National Army is approximately 100,000 in the past <pb xml:id="pg_17" n="17" facs="0047"/>six months. Those soldiers either deserted in the north to live in their native villages or were demobilized as a result of the deactivation of some Vietnamese units.</p>
<p><gloss target="#t_G21">G–2</gloss> puts a very low rating on the Vietnamese National Army compared to the Viet Minh army. The morale of the Vietnamese National Army is very low. It lacks combat as well as logistic capabilities. It has only 650 officers of the rank of captain or higher. According to <gloss target="#t_G21">G–2</gloss> it could not withstand any kind of Viet Minh attack nor can it carry out a mission of pacification and internal security at the present time.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">4. General Estimate</p>
<p><gloss target="#t_G21">G–2</gloss> estimates that the Vietnamese National Army controls only the Saigon area and a few other places near division headquarters in Free Viet-Nam. The rest of the area is subject to the authority of the private armies of the sects or to Viet Minh sympathizers and secret guerrilla cadres. The Viet Minh has removed most of its regular army forces from the south but it has left stores of arms and ammunition in hidden deposits throughout Free Viet-Nam. According to <gloss target="#t_G21">G–2</gloss> the Viet Minh retains a capability for guerrilla warfare in the south which could severely harass the Government of Viet-Nam under present circumstances.</p>

<p>1. Paragraph a reference telegram. <persName corresp="#p_DJH1">Daridan</persName> tells me French subsidies to sects now reduced from earlier amounts and will cease entirely 31 January. I understand <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> now furnishing sects several million piastres per month exact amount unknown. I doubt wisdom our permitting use American aid for sect subsidy except for legitimate pay of sect forces integrated into National Army. About 3,000 <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> and similar number Hoa Hao troops now thus integrated, out of total of 15,000 to 20,000 for each sect in private armies. Under proposed cut-back of Vietnamese armed forces from 160,000 to about <pb xml:id="pg_18" n="18" facs="0048"/>90,000, it is unlikely that additional sectarian troops will be taken in; in fact, it may be necessary eventually to reduce the number now in National Army ranks. In any case, many thousands of sect troops can not be accommodated in National Army and will have to be demobilized. They constitute appreciable danger at present and will continue do so until National Army has been reorganized and redeployed so as to neutralize threat they offer. This danger is not so much that they may seek join forces with Viet Minh (they have apparently been determinedly anti-Communist) as that they may increase their exactions on populations of provinces they control or else turn to wide-scale banditry at time when forces of law and order are still too weak to cope with them. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is aware of this danger which is why government has assumed responsibility for paying at least part of subsidy hitherto paid by French, presumably until it feels strong enough to cut off support with impunity. While there is some danger in this procedure, which may become acute at later time when <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> wishes cut off support, I believe he may have no option at present time but to continue some measure of subsidy to sects. However, this should not be done with direct aid US funds.</p>
<p>2. Re paragraph 3 reference telegram. I intend to push ahead with Vietnamese Government toward reaching agreement on force levels and training in accord with terms of minute of understanding. As stated in my telegram 2554,<note n="3" xml:id="d8fn3"><ref target="#d3">Document 3</ref>.</note> there was never any question of submitting minute of understanding to Vietnamese Government for its approval. Minute was intended only as agreement between US and France which would provide terms of reference for my approach to Vietnamese on military matters. Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> has not yet submitted his ideas on desired force goals, but I understand from <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> that Vietnamese General Staff still talking in terms of 150,000. I still believe I can work out satisfactory arrangement with Vietnamese so long as French Government does not undermine principle of full <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> direction of training and organization established by <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName>. I am not aware of any “secret defense treaty” between France and Vietnam. Department is requested to amplify this reference.<note n="4" xml:id="d8fn4"><p>The Department provided clarification in telegram 2745 to Saigon, January 6, which reads in part:</p>
<p>“Regarding paragraph 2: We have not yet received from French Embassy Washington the revisions which French have suggested (Paris 2826 [repeated] to Saigon) but will not give any concurrence to French scheme until after full study and your views. Secret treaty reference concerns 1950–51 agreement between De Lattre and Vietnamese Government which we did not see but whose existence was confirmed as constituting at that time a definite and exclusive Franco-Vietnamese military pact.

<p>2866. We saw <persName corresp="#p_LCGC1">La Chambre</persName> today prior to his departure on holiday while <persName corresp="#p_MFP1">Mendes</persName> is in Rome and Assembly in recess. Résumé his principal points follows:</p>
<p>1. He is greatly disappointed with results tripartite Ministerial conversations on Indochina December 18.<note n="2" xml:id="d9fn2">For a report on these discussions, see telegram 2601 from Paris, December 19, 1954, <ref target="frus1952-54v13p2"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, vol. XIII, Part 2</ref>, p. 2400.</note> He feels we avoided main issue and postponed decision again when we can no longer afford to do so. He cited understanding he reached with General <persName corresp="#p_SWB1">Smith</persName> last September (when French originally agreed to support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>) to effect that if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> solution did not work “within reasonable time” we would try alternative.<note n="3" xml:id="d9fn3">For documentation on the French-U.S. talks, September 27–29, 1954, see <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> pp. 2080 ff.</note> “Reasonable time” has long since expired and because of our procrastination in taking next step <persName corresp="#p_LCGC1">La Chambre</persName> thinks we may have exceeded time left to us to get on our feet and face Viet Minh.</p>
<p>2. Nevertheless he took satisfaction in indication at conversations that Secretary was prepared to consider alternate solution since time of grace to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has passed. He expressed hope Secretary would continue to place full authority in <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> and that <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> would now prepare precise recommendations for an alternate solution to submit to two governments.</p>
<p>3. <persName corresp="#p_LCGC1">La Chambre</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> has reported situation as being worse than ever and has virtually abandoned hope for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. We reminded him that Secretary had asked <persName corresp="#p_MFP1">Mendes</persName> what other solution <pb xml:id="pg_20" n="20" facs="0050"/>French had in mind and he had admitted there was none for moment. We stated that all alternates suggested to date had disadvantages equal to or greater than <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. We reminded <persName corresp="#p_LCGC1">La Chambre</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> had mandate as result of tripartite discussions to study question of timing and alternative solutions while at same time continuing their support of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government. <persName corresp="#p_LCGC1">La Chambre</persName> agreed and stated that he hoped Generals would make profound study this time and would arrive at precise recommendations to their respective governments in time for their consideration at next high-level Indo-china review, now understood to be tentatively scheduled for late January. <hi rend="italic">Note:</hi> <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> is proceeding to Saigon with such instructions and will doubtless approach <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> on matter immediately.</p>
<p>4. <persName corresp="#p_LCGC1">La Chambre</persName> suggested that in order to give <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> sufficient time to prepare positive suggestions, it may be necessary to request postponement of Indochina review planned for late January. We informed him that if this was French intention they should not delay in making request.</p>
<p>5. We asked latest French Government thinking on alternates to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. He replied that recent consultations with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MFP1">Mendes</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> and fellow Cabinet members convinced him that only possible workable solution was to have <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> return immediately under existing powers. We asked what effect this would have on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government. He replied that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s presence might not only help solve interminable conflicts between sects and government but could result in setting up workable government which, if not as “pure” as <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government would at least accomplish something. When pressed for details <persName corresp="#p_LCGC1">La Chambre</persName> stated they were at present time thinking in terms of <persName corresp="#p_TVH1">Tran Van Huu</persName> as Prime Minister with possibly <persName corresp="#p_NVT1">Tam</persName> in Interior. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> might take part in such government. They had definitely rejected the Buu Hoi formula. (See separate following telegram enlargement this point and our comments.<note n="4" xml:id="d9fn4">Not found in Department of State files.</note>)</p>
<p>6. We asked results of discussions with <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName>. He said <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> had made deep impression on government and parliamentarians who regard him as shrewd observer and one of Frenchmen who knows Vietnam best and is most qualified to analyze Vietnamese reactions and intentions. <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName>’s primary concern now is with French business interests in north, which government is obliged to protect even though it has no illusions on Viet Minh sincerity. At present time French are studying possibility of grouping main French business interests like Charbonnages du Tonkin, Cotonneries de Nam Dinh, Cimenteries de Haiphong together in one organization to facilitate task of carrying on under Viet Minh.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_21" n="21" facs="0051"/>
<p>7. He expressed concern with Department’s failure give them assurances that individuals and firms in north will not be regarded with prejudice by US for having continued in business under Communist regime. Repeated démarches to Department on subject have resulted, he said, in unsatisfactory reply given French Embassy Washington just prior to Secretary’s last trip to Paris which to effect that each case would be judged on merits. Government regarded this as indication future US findings will be adverse and intend to approach Department again in matter.</p>
<p>8. <persName corresp="#p_LCGC1">La Chambre</persName> reported that both <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> and Doctor Huard, Dean of Hanoi School of Medicine and one of most influential Frenchmen left in North Vietnam, respected equally by Vietnam and Viet Minh, have reported that communization of north is going down very badly. They report that while core of Viet Minh adhere strictly to classic <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> Communist pattern, lower echelons are less enthusiastic and sections of populace are beginning show signs hostility and resistance. <persName corresp="#p_LCGC1">La Chambre</persName> has taken heart at these reports and believes they support thesis that it is now all the more important that we gain time and before elections demonstrate to northern populace by means of strong effective government in south that life under non-Communist regime is better. He enlarged on this point as further argument for getting rid of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>
<p>9. We asked what had been discussed during <persName corresp="#p_MFP1">Mendes-France</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> talks last week. <persName corresp="#p_LCGC1">La Chambre</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_MFP1">Mendes</persName> had said nothing about them to him and it was generally understood they were confined to generalities.</p>
<p>10. We asked status of <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> agreement for training Vietnamese Army. <persName corresp="#p_LCGC1">La Chambre</persName> confirmed telegram had been sent to French Embassy Washington yesterday instructing them approach Department on subject. He reported that difficulties arose, not from any substance but principally out of concern that agreement provided for enlargement American military mission in Saigon in contradiction Geneva accord. We reminded <persName corresp="#p_LCGC1">La Chambre</persName> of Secretary’s categorical statement during last tripartite conference, confirmed by <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> who was present, that US would not enlarge military mission. <persName corresp="#p_LCGC1">La Chambre</persName> also reiterated French view that agreement should not take form of Franco-US agreement but should rather be joint Franco-US “recommendation” to Vietnamese Government.</p>

<p>Copies have been given Defense and their early views requested. We hope Paris Saigon will comment soonest. We made no comment to French at time transmittal.</p>
<p>In addition French handed us note outlining basis for their suggested changes. Text follows in free translation:</p>
<list>
<item>“Text of French project of joint recommendation by American and French Governments relating to training of autonomous Vietnamese armed forces which was drawn up on basis work of Generals <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> essentially takes note of following points:</item>
<item>“(1) Sovereignty of Viet-Nam gives it right to determine conditions or training and structure of its army. Therefore it can only be question of recommendation which will be addressed to it by representatives U.S. and France.</item>
<item>“(2) French High Command responsible for execution accord on cessation hostilities in Viet-Nam cannot accept any measure which does not conform this accord. This consideration must govern execution of recommendation and in particular application paragraph four. In this regard certain important points must be emphasized:
<list>
<item>“(a) Number American military personnel present Indo-china at moment cease-fire was 350; this number cannot therefore be augmented.</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_25" n="25" facs="0055"/>
<item>“(b) So far as concerns replacement of those elements <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> which not qualified as advisors and instructors (administrative and supply personnel), it is essential that change-over be carried out in gradual and discreet manner. This replacement poses problem from point of view Geneva Accord and it is necessary that each change may be presented in manner acceptable to <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and not appear as arrival new personnel. Size and rhythm of these numbers must be object of constant consultation between American and French services on spot.</item></list></item>
<item>“(3) Risks involved in measures liable to bring about break in armistice would obviously be much more serious than inconvenience of partial or delayed execution of joint recommendation to Vietnamese Government.”</item></list>

<p>1. Pursuant to suggestion in reference a and in view of forthcoming <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> review of US policies and operations in Associated States referred to in reference b, we met January 7<note n="4" xml:id="d12fn4">At Dalat, South Vietnam.</note> for general review of situation in our respective areas of responsibility.</p>
<p>2. We discussed kind of joint appraisal that would be feasible for us to make and that would be most useful to US Government, and reached following conclusions:</p>
<list>
<item>a. We agreed that it would not be desirable for us to attempt strategic estimate military situation affecting Associated States since this is properly function of <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, requires information and staff assistance not available to us here, and must be conducted in broader framework than that of Associated States themselves.</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_26" n="26" facs="0056"/>
<item>b. We assumed that US Government appreciates, as we do, importance of preventing Associated States from coming further under Communist domination. We continue to believe that US should exert efforts toward this objective in spheres of military, economic, diplomatic and other aid. We have each reported in light of local conditions of chances of success of US assistance in helping these countries resist further Communist gains. These assessments have varied in each country; however, we continue to believe chances of success warrant US effort being made. Since complete withdrawal of US support would be unacceptable, we consider problem to be not whether US should render aid, but rather how much should be provided.</item>
<item>c. With respect to amount of US aid that would be justified in each state (considering chances of success in each), this is problem that can only partially be assessed by us. We have each recommended programs of US military and economic assistance for our respective countries. In determining magnitude of these programs, we have had to weigh combination of such factors as: (1) need for creation of indigenous military forces capable of providing at least minimum security; (2) acceptability of programs to political authorities in each country; (3) level of dollar aid that local economies can absorb without severe maladjustments; and (4) need to secure maximum results with minimum expenditure of US funds. These factors tend to be mutually incompatible, and thus programs recommended are at best balance among somewhat conflicting aims. Programs we have recommended, in consideration of above factors as they exist in each state, comprise contribution that we on ground are competent to make. We feel we cannot properly assess whether costs of programs we have recommended bear proper relation to other programs in Far East which compete with them for available US funds, and therefore whether total cost of programs for three Associated States is sound apportionment of available funds. However, estimates set forth below are in our opinion minimal.</item>
</list>
<p>3. With above in mind, we concluded that most useful function we could perform at this point to assist in forthcoming policy review would be to outline in general terms and in consolidated form total of aid programs we are recommending. Following are cost estimates for two different periods of time, <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 and <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1955. <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 figures set forth our estimate of costs of programs we are recommending, and thus amount of funds that would have to be appropriated to support them. <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1955 figures represent our estimate of costs that will be incurred this calendar year if programs recommended for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 are approved. <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1955 costs presumably would be paid generally from funds already appropriated since, if past procedures are followed, <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 funds for military will be used to finance expenditures of last half of calendar.</p>
<p>It will be noted therefore that figures cited in each period for comparable programs are overlapping. (Figures in millions of dollars).</p>

<p>Total US cost for Vietnam 440.5, Cambodia 55, Laos 62–67; total for three states 557.5–562.5, of which 100 million is for <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>.</p>
<p>4. Comments on tables:</p>
<list>
<item>a. Vietnam</item>
<item>(1) Under <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 56, support for <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> (50 million) is indicated only through <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 55. While we understand present Washington view is that US will not support <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> beyond end this year, circumstances may require some additional support in <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 56, at least until after date scheduled for elections.</item>
<item>(2) Although Vietnam initially estimated to be capable contributing $43 million of its own funds, believe there are operating expenses, i.e., resettlement of soldiers discharged under program for reduction of armed forces and establishment local governments in areas reclaimed from Viet Minh, not planned for. Accordingly, 30 million dollars local contribution believed to be safe estimate.</item>
<item>(3) The $225 million for Armed Forces exceeds 200 million figure estimated heretofore in order to give government more time to spread reduction of armed forces in <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 55. This will be covered in detail in separate message from <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>.<note n="5" xml:id="d12fn5">In telegram 2676 from Saigon, January 10, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> relayed <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Minh</persName>’s strong concern that the force level for South Vietnam of 88,085, as suggested by the United States, was too low and the timetable for reductions from the present level of 217,000 was too rapid. <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Minh</persName> foresaw great problems with such a drastic program. On January 5 he presented a counterproposal accepting reluctantly the size and composition of forces proposed by the United States, but asking for an extension of the phasing-down process until March 1956. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> refused to accept this proposal, but stated he would be willing to recommend to Washington support of a 100,000 Vietnamese force with a target date of December 31, 1955 for reduction to that level. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> estimated the cost of this plan would be roughly $225 million. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.5–MSP/1–1055)</note></item>
<pb xml:id="pg_28" n="28" facs="0058"/>
<item>b. Cambodia</item>
<item>Revised cost of direct forces support based on reduced proposed level of forces of 30,100 and 1500 civilians. Structure remains same as that previously recommended in Phnom Penh’s 352 to Department,<note n="6" xml:id="d12fn6">Dated December 13, 1954, not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751H.5/12–1354)</note> but units are reduced in size. <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> submitting new force structure in separate message with concurrence <persName corresp="#p_MCR1">McClintock</persName>. Cost of $44 million is subject to further reduction if Cambodian Government consents to lower pay forces. Figure for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 56 can be lower than that for <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 55 if pay rates of new inductees are appreciably lower.</item>
<item>c. Laos</item>
<item>Estimated costs Laos armed forces left flexible since substantial reductions in pay and allowances believed possible due to present high scales compared to Vietnam and Cambodia. Refinement these figures as well as survey entire Lao military structure requires prompt assignment qualified personnel to assist Legation in this important work. Such personnel could be placed in Attaché group or <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>.</item></list>
<p>5. We agreed that in Cambodia immediate establishment of logistic and fiscal <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> is necessary to provide supervision and control over US equipment and funds; and that in Laos adequate personnel to perform similar functions should be made available soonest. Competent budget and fiscal personnel will be of great assistance to Chiefs of Mission in analyzing Cambodian and Laotian military budget proposals to insure items budgeted are justified and warrant US support. Need for reduction of pay and allowance scales is case in point.</p>
<p>6. Foregoing tables express our best estimate of situation <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 55 and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 56 as priced out for military and economic aid. However, we cannot emphasize too strongly that acceptance of these or other more refined tables by our Government will not signify automatic success to our venture in Indochina unless our policies are imbued with a spirit of resolution coupled with resiliency to meet a constantly shifting situation. We should likewise wish to emphasize “Indochina” is no longer a useful rubric. “Indochina” does not mean only Vietnam, nor does it fitly describe Cambodia and Laos. Eventually we may have to think of Cambodia and Laos in connection with a broad coalition comprised of these two countries, Burma and Thailand. Likewise with regard to Cambodia and Laos, because of differing political, ethnic and religious factors which are in play there, there is possibly greater scope for diplomatic effort in linking these countries with other areas of southeast Asia to the west.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_29" n="29" facs="0059"/>
<p>7. In respect to Vietnam, diplomacy assumes a third dimensional aspect because of equivocal French position in Vietnam. We consider it important to emphasize that our judgments regarding US assistance to Associated States are made on assumption that French Government policy remains as stated in <persName corresp="#p_SWB1">Smith</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_LCGC1">La Chambre</persName> minute of understanding of 29 September<note n="7" xml:id="d12fn7">For text, see Department of State Press Release 542, September 29, 1954, <ref target="frus1952-54v13p2"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, vol. XIII, Part 2</ref>, p. 2097.</note> and reaffirmed in subsequent <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_MFP1">Mendes-France</persName> talks to effect that France will firmly oppose extension of influence or control of Viet Minh movement. If as Embassy Paris has predicted and as recent telegrams from Paris (re Paris telegrams 2761 repeated Saigon 418 and Paris 2795 repeated Saigon 431<note n="8" xml:id="d12fn8">For telegram 2795, see <ref target="#d5">Document 5</ref>. Telegram 2761 is not printed, but see footnote 5, <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.</note>) have to an extent substantiated, this or a subsequent French Government concludes a deal with <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName>, our entire estimate situation might undergo swift and drastic revision. We believe that under such circumstances US assistance provided Vietnam would have to be continued, even though at a reduced scale, in order to gain time to permit removal of bulk of US furnished military equipment.</p>
<p>8. [Garble] these hedges on future, we strongly feel that investment recommended above is justified and we are confident that if this investment is underwritten by US we will have a fair chance to maintain the integrity of these countries.</p>

<p>2663. 1. I met with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> on 8 January to review developments Vietnam during his absence.</p>
<p>2. I outlined developments in Vietnam as reported Washington in recent telegrams. I reported my conversations with Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName>, and outlined proposals contained subsequent cable<note n="2" xml:id="d14fn2">Apparently the reference is to telegram 2676 from Saigon, January 10; see <ref target="#d12fn5">footnote 5, Document 12</ref>.</note> reference proposed new troop basis and phased reductions Vietnamese forces. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> indicated general agreement with new force proposals.</p>
<p>3. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> then outlined highlights of Paris conference <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_MFP1">Mendes</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> which <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> attended.<note n="3" xml:id="d14fn3">The tripartite Ministerial meeting of December 18, 1954.</note> He indicated that agreement had been reached that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> should review situation Vietnam as of 15 January and report Paris and Washington on chances of success of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government and possible alternatives.</p>
<p>4. My recollection of Paris telegram 2601 Department<note n="4" xml:id="d14fn4">Dated December 19, 1954; for text, see <ref target="frus1952-54v13p2"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, vol. XIII, Part 2</ref>, p. 2400.</note> repeated Saigon 388, was that no date had been specified for such a reevaluation <pb xml:id="pg_31" n="31" facs="0061"/>(subsequent rereading of Paris telegram 2601 confirms this). I told <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> that until clearcut acceptance by France of our minute of understanding on forces and training, and until we had negotiated definite agreement with Vietnamese Government on terms of US direct support, there was little solid basis for reevaluation of Vietnam situation.</p>
<p>5. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> quoted from French minutes of <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_MFP1">Mendes</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> meeting which indicated definite agreement among principals for reevaluation Vietnam situation some time in January. I replied that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government was only now beginning to implement our seven point program, but that I was willing to meet with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> for reevaluation at any time he chose. I said that I felt <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was beginning to make progress on our programs and that only conclusion could reach now was that we would have to continue to support him until there was fair chance to learn results of these programs.</p>
<p>6. I then told <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> I was deeply concerned over delays of French Government, which seemed to have certain elements of deliberate foot dragging, in approving <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> minute of understanding. I pointed out successive reasons for delays: First, the legal review as to whether minute violated Geneva accord, for which I could see no basis; second, that <persName corresp="#p_MFP1">Mendes</persName> was skeptical of presenting our minute as a fait accompli to Vietnam Government, which neither I nor <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> had ever intended; third, when this was cleared up, possibly through my <gloss target="#t_niact1">niact</gloss> 2554,<note n="5" xml:id="d14fn5"><ref target="#d3">Document 3</ref>.</note> French Government, still without confirming approval of our minute, stated they were pouching comments to French Embassy, Washington (see <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 2746<note n="6" xml:id="d14fn6">See <ref target="#d10fn2">footnote 2, Document 10</ref>.</note>) which would further delay proceedings. I told <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> that I had proceeded with preliminary negotiations with Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> along lines we had agreed upon and intended to continue to press an agreement with Vietnamese Government according to our basis understanding as contained in <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> minute. I pointed out that US law required certain stipulations before we could agree to direct aid.</p>
<p>7. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>, in turn, stated there had evidently been a serious misunderstanding. He stated categorically that French Government had approved our minute of understanding and that he fully agreed I should proceed to negotiate directly with Vietnam Government.<note n="7" xml:id="d14fn7">This was not the understanding of the American Embassy in France which stated categorically that while the French approved the substance and general objective of the memorandum of understanding, they were not prepared to accept it as the basis for an approach to the Vietnamese Government. (Telegram 2901 from Paris, January 10; Department of State, Central Files, 751G.5/1–1055)</note> He stated that he would cable Paris at once advising French Government to confirm definitely its approval of <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> minute.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_32" n="32" facs="0062"/>
<p>8. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> then stated that French Government has decided to support <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> strength of 75,000 until 1 June 1955. Thereafter, depending on existing situation, government would determine residual strength of <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> or its complete phase out prior to Vietnamese elections scheduled for mid 1956. He indicated that present thinking of French Government was that the evacuation should be completed by time scheduled for elections. Final decision as to phase out would be made and announced about February, 1954 [<hi rend="italic">1955</hi>].</p>
<p>9. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> stated that rumors that he would be relieved were ill founded. However, he said that independence of three Associated States made his position as Commissioner General anomalous and might shortly force decision as to his status as Commissioner General. I said I hoped his position would not be changed as long as I remained in Vietnam.</p>
<p>10. All of the above, coupled with recent exchange of cables clearly outlining potential misunderstandings between Paris, Washington and Saigon points up question of my returning Washington for consultation as suggested in paragraph 6, my telegram 2455.<note n="8" xml:id="d14fn8">Dated December 25, 1954; for text, see <ref target="frus1952-54v13p2"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, vol.

<p>2872. Representative French Embassy called on Department Jan. 10 to inform us receipt an instruction from Paris which made following points:</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> now returned Saigon with instructions implement rapidly possible “decisions taken by three Ministers Paris December 18” to continue efforts broaden base of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government and bring <pb xml:id="pg_33" n="33" facs="0063"/>about internal reforms and also as discussed by three Ministers work out eventual formula for “changing” <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government.

<p>Went on to say <persName corresp="#p_LCGC1">La Chambre</persName> now seeing <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> in Cannes but we should be assured not a unilateral approach concerning his future but only to express concern over situation Viet-Nam and explore ways making “government of South Viet-Nam more effective”.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s instructions apparently misinterpretation Secretary’s position Paris talks. U.S. made no commitment change <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> or associate <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> with any such change except in event his failure to make progress makes alternative desirable.</p>
<p>According recent information <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is gaining popular support, had highly successful trip through South Annam,<note n="2" xml:id="d15fn2">A report of that trip, January 2–4, is in telegram 2582 from Saigon, January 5.

<head>17. Editorial Note</head>
<p>On January 14 at the Pentagon, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> briefed those present at the joint Department of State–Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting on his trip to the Far East, December 22, 1954–January 5, 1955. The following extract from the Department of State’s memorandum of discussion of the meeting presents the discussion on Vietnam:</p>
<list>
<item>“<persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> found <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> in rather low spirits.</item>
<item>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> rejoined that there now appeared to be important plus signs in the equation which had developed since the <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral</persName>’s visit. Importantly, there was the evidence of Premier <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s popular appeal as evidenced by his recent trip through the villages.</item>
<item>“<persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said that he had met <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, that he certainly was a nice little man, but that unfortunately did not make him strong politically.</item>
<item>“There ensued a discussion of the French role in Vietnam. It was the <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral</persName>’s confirmed opinion that the French had not honestly tried to make <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s term of office a successful one. He saw in M. <persName corresp="#p_DJH1">Daridan</persName> the epitome of French animosity with respect to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_DJH1">Daridan</persName>, in the <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral</persName>’s opinion, should be quietly removed from the Vietnamese scene.</item>
<item>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> generally agreed with <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>’s opinion of the French. He said that the French were encouraging the religious sects in Vietnam to work against <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. Not only that, the <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral</persName> noted, the French had given encouragement to General <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> agreed that the French had not given up by any means.</item>
<item>“Concluding, <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said that the French were definitely working for all of Vietnam to fall to <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName>, and to be attached to the French Union.” (Department of State, State–<gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> Meetings: Lot 61 D 417)</item>

<p>At the meeting of the National Security Council held the previous day, <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> had reported briefly on his impressions of Vietnam along similar lines.

<list>
<item>a. Regret that there apparently has been misunderstanding<note n="2" xml:id="d18fn2">See <ref target="#d13">Documents 13</ref> and <ref target="#d14">14</ref>.</note> regarding <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> minute on Vietnamese forces. Was not <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> intention present Vietnamese Government with written agreement signed by two generals and endorsed by both Governments. Instead he intends negotiate our direct aid and Vietnamese force levels with the Vietnamese Government on basis prior agreed understandings between himself and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> on those matters requiring French-American concurrence. Not his intention derogate from Vietnamese sovereignty but, quite the contrary to enhance it. As <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> minute stated, points were all subject to consent Vietnamese Government.</item>
<item>b. Also regret unfortunate amount time that has been taken in bringing this matter to conclusion with full agreement and understanding between our two governments, since both frequently indicated urgency of rapid effective restoration security and stability Free Viet-Nam. We understood during Washington talks French Government would back whatever <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> agreed to, as <persName corresp="#p_MFP1">Mendes</persName> stated here in November.

<p>2772. 1. I met with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> at his suggestion 14th. I told him I was pleased by what I had seen at Haiphong but was disturbed that nothing had been done to remove US-financed equipment from Charbonnages. (See my telegram 2759<note n="2" xml:id="d19fn2">In this telegram, January 15, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> reported on his brief (January 13–14) visit to Haiphong, and his discussions there with French officials on the questions of removal of American aid-financed equipment and evacuation of refugees. With the notable exception of the equipment in the Charbonnages du Tonkin coal mines, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> was impressed that the French had evacuated most material from Haiphong. He was also impressed with the efficiency of the refugee operation and the caliber and number of those refugees being prepared to move south. (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.)</note>)</p>
<p>2. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that other problems concerning him with regard to Haiphong were maintenance of minimum public services and supplies, removal of all other equipment, and danger of sabotage by Vietnamese immediately before final evacuation. I agreed it would be serious mistake if Vietnamese undertook such sabotage and I would be willing to say so to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he had discussed Haiphong problem with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> previous day, in particular communications equipment removed from Hanoi in alleged violation of Geneva accord. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that if it were possible to settle dispute with Viet <pb xml:id="pg_38" n="38" facs="0068"/>Minh over Hanoi incidents, that might ease Haiphong situation which is tense and may become increasingly difficult.</p>
<p>3. I remarked to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> that it is essential in computing shipping requirements to make certain that no refugees will be left behind in North for lack of transport. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that French can take care of necessary military movement but will continue to need US help for refugees. <persName corresp="#p_OD1">O’Daniel</persName> following up on this. (French must help also.) I asked <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> if he felt last French troops leaving Haiphong might have to fight their way out. He replied that Viet Minh will not in his view attempt prevent French departure by action from outside enclave but they may inspire uprisings and strikes on part of Haiphong residents. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said Viet Minh have no confidence in French good faith and believe that they wish to strip Haiphong. Accordingly <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> fears that he can not until the very end reduce his troop levels below 18/20,000.</p>
<p>4. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> asked me how I proposed that we carry out instructions from our respective governments growing out of latest Paris meeting.<note n="3" xml:id="d19fn3">Tripartite Ministerial discussions on December 18, 1954.</note> He read me telegram from French Foreign Office to French Embassies Washington and London dated January 8 saying that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> had returned to Saigon to pursue efforts toward broadening <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government and carrying out reform programs and would study with me possible alternative government solution. Telegram continued saying that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s role would be defined in light of discussions between <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and me. <persName corresp="#p_LCGC1">La Chambre</persName> would make courtesy call upon <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> in course of vacation at Nice. Conversation would be in general terms. Another telegram of same date to French Embassy Washington said that Ministers had agreed December 18 have another exchange of views re solution Vietnamese political problems and expressing opinion such meeting should take place after <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> assessment. Accordingly express meeting tentatively scheduled end January would not be useful. Ministerial meeting might take place early February when <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> have expressed final views. One final telegram from French Embassy Washington to Paris reported our State Department favors mid-February for such review.</p>
<p>5. I reviewed with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> progress of all aspects of our 7-point program, as reported recent telegrams, concluding that only item in which no progress has been shown is that calling for broadening government. I said I believe that this is not time to consider possible alternative to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> since latter has not yet had full opportunity put program into effect. In absence of specific instructions on this subject (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 2873<note n="4" xml:id="d19fn4"><ref target="#d16">Document 16</ref>.</note> had not arrived), I told <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> that I believe our long-her-alded assessment might be made about first week February, to be completed by 10 February.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_39" n="39" facs="0069"/>
<p>6. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he was also impressed, and even astonished, by improvement in local scene during period of his absence and that he was inclined to favor my proposal. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> went on to say that despite progress made he is still concerned by persistent Viet Minh strength in South where Communists actually administer villages. While 90 percent of population is anti-Communist, they are subjected to effective Viet Minh propaganda and control. This illustrative of how much needs to be done to strengthen action of Interior Minister. I replied that national security action program is designed help solve this problem.</p>
<p>7. Adverting to sects, which he said <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> must continue to handle with caution for some time to come, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said, in reply to question I had asked earlier, that French Union Forces include 4,500 <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> suppletives at monthly cost of 3,339,000 piasters and 1,700 Hoa at monthly cost of 1,045,000 piasters. There are no Binh Xuyen suppletives. Original French plan had been to cease paying these forces December 31 but they will now be paid through January 31. There may be trouble connected with discharge in these forces unless National Government can somehow take on commitment to continue payment for some little period. I pointed out that tentative plan Vietnamese Government was to discharge about 35,000 of its own troops between now and March 1, many of which are suppletives, but agreed that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would probably have to continue some support of sect forces for some time (Vietnam now gives approximately 7 million piasters monthly support to sect suppletives).</p>
<p>8. Turning back to basic problem <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he sincerely hoped <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could succeed, as to install a new government would entail losing at least three or four months. However, he suggested that between ourselves we might consider what steps could be taken if we became convinced <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was hopeless. I remarked in this connection that I hoped <persName corresp="#p_LCGC1">La Chambre</persName> would not paint to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> as black a picture as French had done in recent Paris tripartite ministerial meeting, with which I was not in agreement. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he had brought up question of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> in Paris, adding that although he is aware of Emperor’s faults he believes that at this period of crisis it is inadmissible that chief of state and chief of government should be separated by several thousand kilometers. They should either be together or chief of state should be suppressed. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> added that he was not proposing that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> return immediately but that in next few weeks we should be prepared to suggest that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> return either to support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> or, if necessary, to deal with question of replacement. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> was not popular with French and that it would be difficult for him to gain approval of French Government of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s return. However, if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> does not work out in next few weeks he <pb xml:id="pg_40" n="40" facs="0070"/>feels he and I have no choice but to accept principle of this solution and do what is necessary to carry it out.</p>
<p>He added that he sees no other solution if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should fail. There is no point, he said, in replacing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> by another local team. It is <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> or nothing if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> does not measure up. I said I was willing to give consideration to this suggestion but I considered it inopportune for us to discuss it now, even unofficially, since if news leaked out this would have effect of weakening <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s position vis-à-vis sects. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that his suggestion was not intended to undermine <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>; he felt only that it might be tragic mistake to gamble everything on one single man. I replied that after our February analysis there will be still time to consider an alternative and to make recommendations within 24 hours.</p>
<p>9. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that French press is now showing itself more favorable to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and this should be helpful since press plays considerable part in shaping French opinion. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> also is displaying better understanding of this problem and has taken more moderate line with press in regard to France.</p>
<p>10. This message was drafted prior receipt <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 2870,<note n="5" xml:id="d19fn5">In this telegram, January 13, sent also to Paris as 2514, the Department reported that the French Embassy in Washington had suggested a tripartite Ministerial-level meeting on Indochina in early February, following <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s planned recommendations to their respective governments in late January.

<p rend="center">MEMORANDUM FOR DISCUSSION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CONCERNING INDOCHINA<note n="2" xml:id="d20fn2">For the record of that meeting, see <ref target="#d22">Document 22</ref>.</note></p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Points at issue between the U.S. and France to be raised with Defense</p>
<p>(A) <hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> memorandum of understanding regarding U.S. undertaking responsibility for the training of the Viet-Nam National Army</hi>.</p>
<p>Generals <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> jointly drafted a memorandum of understanding, on December 13, which was submitted to their respective governments for approval (Tab A<note n="3" xml:id="d20fn3">For text of Tab A, see telegram 2261 from Saigon, December 14, 1954, <ref target="frus1952-54v13p2"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, vol. XIII, Part 2</ref>, p. 2366.</note>). The U.S. approved but France revised the document and submitted a revision to the U.S. on January 8 (Tab B<note n="4" xml:id="d20fn4">For text of Tab B, see <ref target="#d10">Document 10</ref>.</note>). <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> opposes the French revision because it omits provision for the autonomy of the Viet-Nam Army and for other unspecified reasons. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> believes there has been a serious misunderstanding between himself and Paris and has asked for clarification.</p>
<p>We have prepared a draft telegram instructing <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> to work out agreement with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>. Although this will take time, it is preferable not to proceed unilaterally with the Vietnamese until we have come to agreement with the French. Defense has not made its views known as yet.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation.</p>
<p>That the draft telegram (Tab C<note n="5" xml:id="d20fn5">For text of Tab C, see <ref target="#d18">Document 18</ref>.</note>) be approved by the Secretary and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>’s approval be obtained during the State–Defense meeting. (Telegram attached at Tab C sent Jan. 14 with Defense approval. No action required.)</p>
<p>(B) <hi rend="italic">Difference in U.S.-French views on future of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government</hi>.</p>
<p>The French have repeatedly attempted to secure U.S. approval to the setting of a deadline, by which date <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would somehow be replaced by a Government of their choosing, ostensibly with U.S. concurrence. The U.S. has avoided agreeing to any specific replacement for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> or to any precise deadline for rating his performance. <pb xml:id="pg_42" n="42" facs="0072"/>The French have in mind either the return of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> or the establishment of a viceroy with the appointment of either Prince Buu Hoi or former Premier <persName corresp="#p_TVH1">Tran Van Huu</persName> as Premier and the inclusion of <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NVT1">Tam</persName> in such a government. Buu Hoi has been exceedingly pro-Viet Minh in the past, while <persName corresp="#p_TVH1">Huu</persName> has been a neutralist and opportunist and their recent efforts to demonstrate a change of heart are unconvincing. While some French officials may honestly, because of advice given them, believe that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is incapable and should be replaced for that reason there are others who are apparently aiming at the establishment of a pro-French Government in Free Viet-Nam which might form a working arrangement with the Communists prior to the 1956 elections and would, after that date, form a coalition government with the Viet Minh.</p>
<p>We continue to oppose such a maneuver and continue to support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in the absence of a preferable alternate. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> is now reporting a slow but steady improvement in <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> as a leader and in conditions in Free Viet-Nam.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation.</p>
<p>That we continue to oppose French efforts to replace <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> with a personality who would work toward a coalition with the Communists. This position would include continuing efforts to influence <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to appoint more effective ministers and to move ahead vigorously in reforms. Although Defense has not opposed such policy in the past, it should be spelled out to Defense representatives for their appreciation.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Points at issue between State and Defense</p>
<p>(A) <hi rend="italic">Formation of a U.S. training <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> in Cambodia</hi>.</p>
<p>The Cambodian Government has asked us to enter into direct military training and direct budgetary support of their forces. Defense approval to the bilateral agreement to establish a <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> in Cambodia included a <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> prerequisite that either the bilateral agreement or a separate agreement with Cambodia spell out that all French instructors now with the Cambodian Army, eventually be withdrawn. Defense insists that such an agreement precede the establishment of a U.S. <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, whether for logistical purposes or for actual training. (See Tab D<note n="6" xml:id="d20fn6">Not printed.</note>)</p>
<p>Continued and repeated working level efforts by the Department to have this prerequisite dropped or modified by Defense have met with no success, and it is hoped that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>’s and <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>’s approval can be obtained at the State–Defense meeting regarding solution to this problem. In the meantime, Ambassador <pb xml:id="pg_43" n="43" facs="0073"/><persName corresp="#p_MCR1">McClintock</persName> is reluctant to begin direct budgetary support of the Cambodian National Army and since French subsidies stopped on December 31, 1954, there will soon be a condition of an unpaid army.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation.</p>
<p>That Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> be informed of the dangers inherent in attempting to proceed with the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> prerequisite on the grounds that it will cause unfavorable reaction in the International Control Commission, will probably be viewed with considerable concern by the Cambodian Government itself and most certainly cause violent French reactions involving European matters as well as Indochinese. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> prerequisite should therefore be withdrawn or modified on the grounds of overwhelming political considerations. (Tab X<note n="7" xml:id="d20fn7">Tab X was not attached to the source text.</note>)</p>
<p>(B) <hi rend="italic">Question of U.S. supplying additional helicopters and light planes to French in Indochina for use by International Control Commission</hi>.</p>
<p>The French have been pressing us for several months to supply seven additional helicopters and six light planes for the use of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>. They state they have an insufficient number available to meet both basic French and additional <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> requirements (Tab E<note n="8" xml:id="d20fn8">Tab E, not printed, was a copy of a memorandum by <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, January 6, which provided the Secretary with background on the French request for helicopters.</note>). When Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> called on the Secretary and Mr. Merchant on January 7 on the subject, the Secretary stated he would look into this matter again as a result of <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s personal request.<note n="9" xml:id="d20fn9">A report on this discussion is in a memorandum of conversation by Merchant, January 7, which is filed with a memorandum by <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>, undated, to <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> supporting the French request for helicopters. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/1–755)</note></p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation.</p>
<p>That the Secretary raise this matter with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> in an effort to have Defense reconsider their refusal to consider the supply of at least some additional helicopters. Light planes conceivably could be made available by Canada and have already been offered by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName> have recommended in a joint Embassy/<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> message (Saigon telegram 2403—Tab F<note n="10" xml:id="d20fn10">Not printed.</note>) that we supply on a loan basis additional helicopters and planes but Defense has not answered this message or indicated any position other than their previous opposition.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_44" n="44" facs="0074"/>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Points at issue between U.S. and France</p>
<p>There are a considerable number of points at issue between the U.S. and France, concerning Indochina, and developments are rapidly bringing these differences closer to either a solution or a serious rupture in U.S.-French relations. The most important points include:</p>
<p>(A) <hi rend="italic">French efforts to secure the replacement of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> discussed in 1–B above</hi>.</p>
<p>(B) <hi rend="italic">Continued French influence in Cambodia and Laos</hi>.</p>
<p>The French have adopted a policy in Cambodia which indicates they intend to strengthen their position and influence in Cambodia and Laos. While in the latter country this arrangement appears to meet with the tacit approval of the Laotians. There is no firm resolution evidenced by the Cambodians to expel the French military advisors. The latter government has asked us to undertake direct military training, with a <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> (see 2–A above for unresolved U.S. internal position in this question), and we are prepared to undertake direct budgetary support of the Cambodian Army as well as an economic aid program. The French allege to fear we are attempting to displace them and have put forward a specious complaint to the effect our policy is inconsistent with the Secretary’s assurances that we do not intend to take the place of France in Indochina. We expect further discord in this field as progress is made in U.S. military and economic programs.</p>
<p>(C) <hi rend="italic">The <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> Mission</hi>.</p>
<p>The <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> Mission to the Viet Minh is taking on the appearance and functions of a Diplomatic Mission, despite French assurances to us that such is not their intention. The Viet Minh are expected by the French to request reciprocal representation in Paris. <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> has requested U.S. approval to the shipment of various strategic items (fuels and vehicles) in opposition to U.S. economic policies of holding to the same controls with respect to the Viet Minh as are applied to Red China. The U.S. views the increased activity and influence of the <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> Mission with concern and fears that continued French deals with the Viet Minh can only weaken the Free World position vis-à-vis Communism in general and make more difficult our efforts to prevent the loss of Free Viet-Nam.</p>
<p>(D) <hi rend="italic">Viet Minh alignment with Soviet Bloc</hi>.</p>
<p>The Viet Minh itself leaves no question as to its direction and sympathies and its recent agreement with Red China<note n="11" xml:id="d20fn11">The reference is to a joint communiqué issued in Peking on December 24, 1954, stating that China and North Vietnam had agreed on Chinese material and personnel aid in restoring communications between the two countries and in reconstructing Vietnamese water conservation projects destroyed during the war.</note> has resulted in feverish efforts to open up direct rail communication to the China border (which will establish a direct Moscow to Haiphong line of <pb xml:id="pg_45" n="45" facs="0075"/>communication) and other ominous moves. Red Chinese airplanes and uniformed Chinese “technicians” are now on the airfield at Hanoi, and the influx of Polish “technicians” and the arrival of Ambassadors from the Communist bloc countries is consistent with the Viet Minh policy which has doubled its effective military strength since Geneva and equipped it with arms made in Soviet Europe as well as Red China in violation of the Geneva Accords.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Progress of the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government</p>
<p>Despite the elements of disagreement between the U.S. and France outlined above, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> reports definite improvement in both <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s effectiveness and conditions in general in Free Viet-Nam. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s recent visit to central Viet-Nam resulted in impressive evidence of popular support which tends to belie French allegation of his lack of popularity. He is making satisfactory progress with the resettlement of over 400,000 refugees, internal security is not worsening and there are evidences that some anti-governmental groups are swinging to his support. His Defense Minister and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> are working harmoniously and making progress toward a mutually satisfactory National Army. The political and economic impact of direct U.S. budgetary support has not yet been felt (it began January 1) but this will have a favorable effect on Free Viet-Nam.</p>
<p>If we need anything to hearten us in our policy, it is necessary only to scan the heavily increased Viet Minh propaganda which daily exorcises <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, praises the French and castigates the U.S. capitalistic warmongers.</p>

<p>3034. Ministry Associated States asked us call this morning regarding <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ forthcoming trip Washington. We had informed <persName corresp="#p_MRL1">Massigli</persName> of it yesterday (Embassy telegram 3010<note n="2" xml:id="d21fn2">Dated January 17, not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.5/1–1755)</note>) and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> has suggested to <persName corresp="#p_LCGC1">La Chambre</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ presence Washington be taken <pb xml:id="pg_46" n="46" facs="0076"/>advantage of for talks French requested for early February (Department telegram 2514,<note n="3" xml:id="d21fn3">See <ref target="#d19fn5">footnote 5, Document 19</ref>.</note> Embassy telegrams 2970<note n="4" xml:id="d21fn4">The reference should be to telegram 2980 from Paris, January 14, which deals with the question of possible tripartite talks. Telegram 2970, January 13, is unrelated to the question.</note> and 2987<note n="5" xml:id="d21fn5">Dated January 14, not printed. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/1–1455)</note>).</p>
<p>We noted there is apparently misunderstanding about dates as Department telegram 2514 reported French Embassy Washington had suggested February 4 while Foreign Office spoke yesterday of “mid-February”. Ministry explained that when French Embassy suggested February 4 Department preferred mid-February. French now ask that date be set which will permit <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> be present.</p>
<p>We raised question contained Department’s unnumbered telegram of January 13, 6:23 p.m.,<note n="6" xml:id="d21fn6">The reference is to telegram 2872 to Saigon, pouched to Paris, <ref target="#d15">Document 15</ref>.</note> received today by pouch noting again difference in interpretation decisions reached at December 18 Ministerial conversations. We stated that Secretary had made no commitment to change <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government or associate <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> with any such change. Ministry readily admitted this but at same time observed that <persName corresp="#p_MFP1">Mendes</persName> had stated that “we must now prepare our minds for an alternative” (paragraph 3, Embassy telegram 2601<note n="7" xml:id="d21fn7">Dated December 19, 1954; for text, see <ref target="frus1952-54v13p2"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, vol. XIII, Part 2</ref>, p. 2400.</note>) and that Secretary agreed that <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> should be instructed study alternatives (paragraph 15, Embassy telegram 2601). French also observed that Secretary agreed that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> should be requested investigate matter of timing (paragraphs 16 and 17, Embassy telegram 2601). Finally, they maintained it agreed that two Generals should come to a conclusion on three points (paragraph 16, Embassy telegram 2601) and make recommendations to their two governments so that necessary decisions can be taken at next Indochina review.</p>
<p>French used their own notes of meeting to back up their interpretation pointing to fact that Secretary had informed <persName corresp="#p_MFP1">Mendes</persName> that every time French had pointed to failings of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and were asked what they had in mind as an alternative they had been unable to supply one. They noted specifically <persName corresp="#p_MFP1">Mendes</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> exchanges outlined in paragraph 12, Embassy telegram 2601, to effect that US had obstinately closed its mind to possible alternative solution and that investigation of an alternate must be done on careful basis and in the meanwhile we must continue to support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> (paragraph 14, Embassy telegram 2601). Both statements, they claimed, provided additional evidence that we had agreed to study question of alternative so as to be prepared if need for one should present itself.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_47" n="47" facs="0077"/>
<p>In order, if possible, to run down question of different interpretations once and for all, we asked French to compare their notes of December 18 meeting with our own. They did so in detail and we must admit that they were virtually identical to our own in most instances and were identical on portions set forth above. Although there seems to be some question whether as his first point <persName corresp="#p_MFP1">Mendes</persName> had in mind the Viceroy question or that of supporting <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> (paragraph 2 of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>’s telegram 2697<note n="8" xml:id="d21fn8">Dated December 26, 1954; for text, see <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> p. 2425.</note>) there appears to be no difference of opinion that second point was to study alternatives to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government for use only in event that it was subsequently decided that government had still not succeeded in its task. Further-more, appears to be no difference of opinion that third point, as stated in paragraph 16 of Department telegram 2601, was to investigate matter of timing in sense that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> should make recommendations to their respective governments in matter, again presumably for submission to joint review. Our impression to this effect not only borne out by our own detailed notes of conversations and by French notes which fit but from Secretary’s own recollection as set forth in paragraph 4. In conversation this morning as on several recent occasions, we have emphasized that date is not to be set now for possible replacement <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> but rather that recommendations in matter are to be made and that in any case recommendations for any change in government will only be considered if we agree that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government has failed in its purpose. Again we noted that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has not failed and is in fact, according to our reports from Saigon, improving.</p>
<p>To summarize, while French admit that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> are not to set deadline for replacement <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and that US made no commitment to change <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> or associate <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> with any such change except in event <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s failure to make progress makes alternative desirable, they maintain that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> have a mandate from December 18 conversations study question of eventual alternatives to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and to submit results their respective studies to two governments in anticipation next Indochina review. Findings may or may not be considered depending on progress <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has made by that time. Trust this meets Department’s understanding.</p>
<p>Since drafting above, Ministry has said they will instruct <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_DJH1">Daridan</persName> or both to attend Washington talks with <persName corresp="#p_LCGC1">La Chambre</persName> but that from standpoint latter’s schedule February 8 or 9 would be earliest date he could be in Washington.</p>

<p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Viet-Nam</p>
<p>In opening the meeting the Secretary said that in his opinion things seemed to be going better in Viet-Nam. He referred to <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName>’ most recent telegram, Saigon’s 2811.<note n="2" xml:id="d22fn2">In this telegram, January 17, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> reported that he had that day informed <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that he was being recalled to Washington for consultations on Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> put the most favorable light possible on his trip vis-à-vis the Vietnamese situation, which reassured <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> Central Files, 120.1515G/1–1755)</note> There was some discussion of the <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> minute of understanding on the organization and training of autonomous Vietnamese armed forces. The Secretary said that he had the impression that <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> was proceeding to negotiate satisfactorily with the Vietnamese on a de facto basis. This was confirmed. In reply to the Secretary’s question on the status of this memorandum, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> reported that there appeared to be a complete misunderstanding in Paris since the French Embassy had informed the Department this morning that, according to a telegram from Paris, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> had agreed to present the French revision to the Vietnamese.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Cost Estimates</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> then said that his principal concern was the costs estimate of $700 to $800 million over a two-year period which <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> had submitted in a recent telegram.<note n="3" xml:id="d22fn3">Apparent reference to telegram 2636, <ref target="#d12">Document 12</ref>.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that these figures were all well and good but that he thought the figures should be considered on a comparative basis for the area as a whole. What are the chances for effective results? He recalled that when <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> went out to Viet-Nam, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had <pb xml:id="pg_49" n="49" facs="0079"/>indicated that prospects were very vague, perhaps ten, twenty or thirty percent. The problem was to find the source of funds of such large estimates. The only one in existence is the $700 million fund under Section 121.<note n="4" xml:id="d22fn4">The reference is to section 121 of the Mutual Security Act of 1954, Public Law 665, enacted August 26, 1954; for text of this section, see 68 Stat. 837.</note> The Indochina estimates amount to about one-half of that fund. He was worried because Defense has a large number of other items to charge against this same fund.</p>
<p>Later on in the meeting Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> came in at the Secretary’s request to discuss the table of $1,100 million claims on Section 121, which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> had given the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> recently. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that new estimates presented by <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> appear to be substantially more than previous figures. He wanted to know if there was enough money in this fund to take care of <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ estimates.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> replied that there was sufficient money to take care of <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ estimates. However, the $700 million is oversubscribed by other items, mainly, military hardware amounting to some $550 million. This includes the item of $154 million for the rehabilitation of equipment in Indochina. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> noted that there was about $400 million oversubscribed. The question is what are legitimate claims against this fund. The problem is to place the highest priority tag on these various items to bring the total of claims down to $700 million. In answer to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>’s question that there did not seem to be enough money for all the promises made to the various governments, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> replied there was enough to meet existing commitments but not enough to meet additional claims that are considered desirable.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> said that Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> had arranged for a meeting with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHS1">Hensel</persName> and himself to establish priority tags in order to scale down claims against the fund. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> asked whether or not there would be any savings out of the $785 million of the 1954 funds. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> said there might be $50 million at most, but that was even doubtful.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">3. United States Training Mission in Cambodia</p>
<p>The Secretary said that apparently the Defense Department wanted an explicit secret agreement in writing from the Cambodian Government to phase out the French. It seemed to him that this matter could better be taken care of in practice as time went on rather than by a written agreement. That could have pretty bad repercussions. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> commented that when he was in Phnom Penh a State Department message had arrived which indicated that the State Department more or less agreed.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_50" n="50" facs="0080"/>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that the principal problem was the great repercussion that such an agreement would certainly cause with the French. If there were nothing to consider but Cambodia there might be no problem but a secret agreement could have a tremendous effect on all our relations with the French across the board. This was one of those cases where a problem in one area leads to more problems in others. He wondered why it would not be just as adequate to seek an agreement which would put the training of the Cambodian forces under the full charge and full responsibility of the US <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>. The Secretary asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> if we could not use the same formula as in Viet-Nam.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> pointed out that apparently the French have no agreement with the Cambodian Government on a training mission. If we can get an agreement with Cambodia, then the French will not be a party. But he said the question is whether we can go back to the Cambodians and ask them to phase out the French without an explicit agreement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> explained that the Defense Department feels strongly about this since the US has had no success with the French military where we have tried to work with them. Officers in the Pentagon shudder to think of getting into another such situation in Cambodia. There was general agreement around the table that there had been many difficulties with the French military.</p>
<p>The Secretary commented that oral assurances from the Cambodians might be a possibility, although of course they would not be nearly as effective as a written agreement. Nevertheless, he felt it was necessary to live with the situation and let it work itself out in practice, as far as French military instructors were concerned.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> then proposed the following draft agreement with the Cambodians as a possible solution:</p>
<list>
<item>“The Cambodian Government, recognizing that the actual direction of an effective program in field of military training and organization must be vested in a single authority, agrees that full responsibility for assisting the Government of Cambodia in the organization and training of its armed forces will be assumed by the Chief of the United States Military Assistance Advisory Group on______1955.”</item>
</list>
<p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said he personally could accept this formula since the French could not expect to stay if we had full authority. He pointed out that he was speaking personally and not for the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, since their position was that a written agreement on a French phase out was a prerequisite.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that he would go along with State’s suggestion.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_51" n="51" facs="0081"/>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Additional Helicopters for the International Control Commission</p>
<p>The Secretary read from Saigon’s 2784.<note n="5" xml:id="d22fn5">In this telegram, January 15, the Embassy in Saigon reported the gist of an aide-mémoire from the French reaffirming the gravity and urgency of the need for helicopters and light aircraft for use by the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/1–1555)</note> He pointed out that the situation in Laos was becoming more acute and that the Commission was handicapped by lack of helicopters.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that he was worried about opinion in the US. The Americans had heard so much about the failures of the French and the loss of equipment that there might be unfavorable reaction to turning more equipment, especially helicopters in short supply, over to the French. He thought it might be better to loan the helicopters to the Canadian Government which could then make them available to the French to fly and maintain. He thought this would be a much more popular issue. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> pointed out that there might be certain operational difficulties since only the French air force has the capability of maintaining and supplying aircraft in Indochina.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> pointed out that everyone on the spot had underlined the very real shortage—<persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName>, the British, the Canadians and even the Indians. Mr. MacArthur said that Yost had again urged the very real need for such helicopters to give the Commission more mobility, and pointed out that the situation in Laos could disintegrate.</p>
<p>The Secretary asked Mr. Merchant if the French would regard it as openly offensive if we made the helicopters available to the Canadians instead of the French. Mr. Merchant thought that the French would be slighted but that this could be circumvented perhaps by leasing the helicopters to the Canadians who would ask the French to operate them. Mr. Merchant said that the Canadian Ambassador was coming in to see him this afternoon and asked whether this should be raised with him then.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> to check up on this matter and report as soon as possible to the Secretary as to whether the helicopters could be made available. He hoped that the matter could be explored first with Canada on a loan basis for six months. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said that the helicopters might be obtained in Korea and Japan. Mention was made of the possibility that the Canadians themselves might have helicopters which they had obtained from the US since they do not manufacture them. It was agreed that Mr. Merchant would explore this matter with the Canadian Ambassador this afternoon.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_52" n="52" facs="0082"/>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">5. <gloss target="#t_MDA1">MDA</gloss> Matériel in Viet-Nam</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> pointed out that this could be a “hot” issue since many members of Congress, particularly certain influential committee members, had expressed great concern over the possible loss of this matériel to the Communists. He pointed out that most of the matériel had been moved out of the north to Saigon. The excess equipment is to be recovered by the US in accordance with the <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> memorandum of December 1.<note n="6" xml:id="d22fn6">The text of the minute of understanding, signed by <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> in Saigon and providing for immediate U.S.-French negotiations to establish procedures for the return to U.S. control of excess <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> equipment is in telegram 1793 from Saigon, November 10, 1954, as changed by telegram 2023 to Saigon, November 18, 1954. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.5–MSP/11–1054)</note> <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> pointed out that we were getting most of this back and that it was now undergoing an inventory.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that the problem now was not how much matériel had been moved out of the north and the south but how to get the matériel out of Saigon. It would have been preferable if most of this matériel could have been moved from Haiphong to some other place in the Far East than Saigon. Now it was a question of getting out of Saigon before there was danger that it might be lost.</p>
<p>The Secretary suggested that a report ought to be made to these Congressmen to show them what a good job has actually been done.</p>

<p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_ATC1">Ted</persName>: I am writing you this brief personal note to let you know that a number of us here in the Department are very much concerned over the repeated French insistence that <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Joe Collins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> discuss now and come up with a possible alternative to the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government, should the latter fail. While it is perfectly true that at the December 18 meeting in Paris the Secretary did, as a result of strong insistency by <persName corresp="#p_MFP1">Mendès-France</persName>, reluctantly agree that <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Joe Collins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> were authorized to exchange views on possible alternatives to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> on a most secret basis, the fact of the <pb xml:id="pg_53" n="53" facs="0083"/>matter is that we have no alternative whatsoever to put forward, nor are we willing to consider alternative solutions at this juncture. At a time when <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> at long last appears to be moving ahead in the right direction and making some real progress with corresponding indications of substantial popular support, it would be madness and folly to get involved in an academic exercise where we would have no alternative to put forward and would be unwilling to agree to any alternative which the French might put forward. If the French have an alternative and wish <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> to put it forward, they are at liberty to do so; but it would be slapped down insofar as we are concerned.</p>
<p>With the above in mind, is it not possible for you to get hold of <persName corresp="#p_LCGC1">Guy La Chambre</persName>, Cheysson, and any others, and dissuade them from continuing to insist on a discussion of alternatives? If they are unwilling to be so persuaded, at least make them come out into the open. We are astonished that they could even think of suggesting <persName corresp="#p_TVH1">Tran Van Huu</persName> as you reported Saint-Mleux recently did. I repeat, we are concerned about French insistence because we do not know what is really eating them and what ulterior motives some of them may have in insisting on this exercise at this time when real progress appears to be in the making by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>
<p>I think we here in the Department, including myself, have been remiss in not making clearer to you in the light of the satisfactory evolution of events of the past several weeks, our feeling about this exercise so that you would be in a better position to deal with the French on it. I am sure that you will be able to handle this one adequately so that on the one hand it will not appear that the Secretary is in any way repudiating the December 18 talks, and on the other hand we do not become involved in an exercise which if it were leaked by the French could perhaps destroy <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> at the very moment that he seems to be moving ahead favorably.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Report on Vietnam for the National Security Council</item>
</list>
<p>1. The situation in Vietnam is most complex and difficult to fathom. My judgments are conditioned by the fact that I have been in Vietnam only two months. However, during this period I have studied intensively the ewvor factors which will affect the outcome of our efforts to save Free Vietnam from Communism. These major factors are:</p>
<list>
<item>a) <hi rend="italic">The Strength and Intentions of the Viet Minh:</hi> Free Vietnam cannot match the military power of the Viet Minh who have, and will retain, the capability to overrun Free Vietnam if they wish. Free Vietnam’s ultimate security lies in the military and moral support it may receive under the Manila Pact. Strong affirmation by the signatories to the Manila Pact of their determination to react if hostilities were renewed in Indochina may be an essential factor in deterring the Viet Minh from launching an open attack. Moreover such a declaration would greatly strengthen the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government’s position. The Viet Minh have left elements throughout South Vietnam which constitute a continuing threat to the nation’s security. On the other hand the Viet Minh have serious economic problems in the North, where semi-confiscatory taxation and other acts of repression have created much dissatisfaction. Knowledge of these adverse conditions of life in the North, as it reaches Free Vietnam, is beginning to have a salutary effect on the attitudes of people in the South and may have considerable bearing on the elections if they are held in 1956.</item>
<item>b) <hi rend="italic">The Attitude and Intentions of France:</hi> There is considerable doubt in my mind as to the real intentions and objectives of France in Indochina. There is strong evidence that the French favor a new Vietnamese Government which will offer no serious resistance to the Viet Minh or to French direction. Without French support, and that support is far from assured, the survival of Free Vietnam is problematical.</item>
<item>c) <hi rend="italic">Attitude and Intentions of the Sects:</hi> The politico-religious armed groups called the <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName>, Hoa Hao, and Binh Xuyen are anti-Communist <pb xml:id="pg_55" n="55" facs="0085"/>in orientation, but feudalistic and regressive in all other respects. At present they have an effective veto power over government action. This power they use to block reforms which might threaten their preferred military, economic and political status. They will retain their power to threaten and harass the government until the National Army is strong enough to neutralize their forces.</item>
<item>d) <hi rend="italic">Loyalty and Effectiveness of the Vietnamese Armed Forces:</hi> When I arrived in Vietnam the Government was terrorized by a rebellious Chief of Staff, General <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName>’s departure and dismissal shortly thereafter cleared the way for steps to render the Army subordinate to the government. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> now has a fair measure of control over the armed forces. The Army is being deployed throughout the country to carry out a so-called “National Security Action” program designed to combat Viet Minh infiltration and restore civil government throughout the country. The Army’s degree of effectiveness in executing this program will have a decisive bearing on the success or failure of the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government. It is too soon to predict whether or not the National Security Action program will succeed but agreement by the United States to assume training responsibility and to grant financial aid to a reorganized and revitalized national army should have significant stabilizing effects.</item>
<item>e) <hi rend="italic">Economic Aspects of Free Vietnam:</hi> Free Vietnam is capable of maintaining a viable economy, at modest levels. The territory is now self-sufficient in food and formerly produced a substantial rice export surplus. Rice and rubber are traditionally the principal sources of Vietnamese foreign exchange. As security improves, export availability of these products should increase, thus contributing toward stabilization of the economy.</item>
<item>f) <hi rend="italic">Ability of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to Secure Broad Popular Support:</hi> There is still a serious question in my mind as to whether <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will be able to establish broad popular confidence in, and support for, his Government. However, he has enjoyed some recent successes in his dealings with the sects. This and his retention of active U.S. support have tended to enhance his prestige. However, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has much yet to learn about practical politics and public relations. While at times he conveys the impression of being well over his depth, recently he has evidenced greater flexibility in handling people and increased self-confidence in dealing with his ministers and public issues. On balance I believe that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s integrity, strong nationalism, tenacity, and spiritual qualities render him the best available Prime Minister to lead Vietnam in its struggle against Communism.</item>
</list>
<p>2. In order to assist the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government to capitalize on its advantages and to overcome the obstacles to its success, I have directed the principal efforts of the United States in Vietnam, in cooperation with the French, toward aiding the Vietnamese to develop and execute a series of emergency programs covering the military establishment, agrarian reform, refugee resettlement, fiscal management, and the establishment of a national assembly. Some progress, of increasing momentum, is being made in all these fields, with corresponding increase in the stability of the Government. The least successful aspect of my mission has been my failure thus far to <pb xml:id="pg_56" n="56" facs="0086"/>induce <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to broaden his Government by including other able, experienced leaders, such as Dr. <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Phan Huy Quat</persName>, former Defense Minister.</p>
<p>3. Considering all factors, although the situation in Vietnam is not bright, I believe that if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has firm U.S. support and guidance and active French cooperation, or at least acquiescence, his Government has a reasonable prospect of success. While the atmosphere in Saigon has improved demonstrably since November, owing to the departure of General <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName> and the backing which the United States Government has given to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, I have been unable to determine the extent of improvement in the countryside and villages of Free Vietnam. There the Viet Minh will maintain a significant degree of control until the National Security Action program is well advanced. Moreover, the sects, although displaying some uneasiness that their days of political and financial independence may be numbered, remain devoid of any sense of national conscience and still have the capacity to do great harm. Likewise the prospect of national elections in 1956 hangs as a threat over Free Vietnam. This threat may reach the stage of crisis by July 1955, the period when under the Geneva Accord the two sides are to begin discussions leading to elections. Nevertheless, in my judgment, there is at least an even chance that Vietnam can be saved from Communism if the present programs of its Government are fully implemented.</p>

<p>c. However, if it is necessary to reduce Vietnam’s share of the $700,000,000 currently appropriated for Southeast Asia, it would be possible to limit the amount made available to Vietnam to $172,300,000 (required for 1st half of <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1955) if we could be assured <pb xml:id="pg_57" n="57" facs="0087"/>of $155,000,000 (required for 2nd half of <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1955) from new <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 appropriations.</p>

<p>5. In view of the importance of Vietnam to all of Southeast Asia, I am convinced that the United States should expend the funds, materiel, and effort required to strengthen the country and help it retain its independence. I cannot guarantee that Vietnam will remain free, even with our aid. But I know that without our aid Vietnam will surely be lost to Communism. If the chances of success are difficult to calculate, the results of a withdrawal of American aid are only too certain, not only in Vietnam but throughout Southeast Asia. Such a withdrawal would hasten the rate of Communist advances in the Far East as a whole and could result in the loss of Southeast Asia to Communism. In my opinion, the chance of success is not only worth the gamble; we cannot afford to let Free Vietnam go by default.</p>

<head>25. Editorial Note</head>
<p>In response to a request by Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> on January 5 for an assessment of the impact of the loss of South Vietnam, of continued but reduced assistance to South Vietnam, and of contingencies in between, the Joint Chiefs of Staff concluded that the suggested possibilities were incomplete. The Joint Chiefs considered <pb xml:id="pg_58" n="58" facs="0088"/>the following courses of action to be available to the United States in light of the current situation in South Vietnam: a) to continue aid as currently being developed with the cooperation of the French and Vietnamese; b) to institute a unilateral program of direct guidance to South Vietnam through an “advisory” system, under which “the amount of U.S. aid should be dependent upon Vietnamese adherence to U.S. direction”; c) if neither of the above proved sufficient to save South Vietnam, “to deploy self-sustaining U.S. forces to South Vietnam, either unilaterally or as a part of a Manila Pact force”; and d) to withdraw all support from Vietnam and concentrate on the rest of Southeast Asia. In their conclusion, the Joint Chiefs did not, in the absence of a necessary “firm decision at national level as to implementation of U.S. policy in Southeast Asia,” recommend any one of these options, but did express their opposition to what they termed “a ‘static’ defense for the area” and recommended adoption of a “concept of offensive action against the ‘military power of the aggressor.’” For text of the memorandum by <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> of January 5 and the Joint Chiefs response of January 21, see <hi rend="italic">United States–Vietnam Relations, 1945–1967</hi>, Book 10, pages 860–863.</p>

<p>2629. <persName corresp="#p_ATC1">Achilles</persName> from Secretary. Following <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName>’ return to Washington today, we have been discussing various problems in Viet-Nam.</p>
<p>I feel that the first matter requiring decision is to resolve our present outstanding differences with the French regarding the memorandum of understanding signed by Generals <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> on December 13 and the revision submitted to us by the French on January 7. To settle this point, I want you to see <persName corresp="#p_MFP1">Mendès-France</persName> as soon as possible and give him this personal message from me: (I leave to your judgment best way notify <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> to ensure he does not feel by-passed <pb xml:id="pg_59" n="59" facs="0089"/>passed. I feel importance this matter requires approach to Prime Minister.<note n="2" xml:id="d26fn2">According to telegram 3135 from Paris, January 25, <persName corresp="#p_ATC1">Achilles</persName> was unable to see <persName corresp="#p_MFP1">Mendès-France</persName> who was tied up in the Senate on January 25, but the Chargé received assurances that the message would be delivered to the French Prime Minister that evening. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> was also given a copy. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.5/1–2555)</note>)</p>
<list>
<item>“Dear Mr. President: I have been concerned over our differences with respect to the issues covered in the memorandum of understanding signed by Generals <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> on December 13 and by the subsequent proposed revision of that memorandum drawn up by your government.</item>
<item><persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> and I talked this matter over this afternoon and we reached agreement on the following actions which I hope you will find acceptable and will adopt finally to settle this matter.</item>
<item>There are two fundamental points of difference between the agreement between Generals <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> and the revised text proposed by your Government, one, in regard to the autonomy of the Vietnamese Army, to be accomplished by July 1, 1955, and two, the conditions under which the US <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> will carry out training functions with respect to the Vietnamese Army.</item>
<item>I suggest that the first point be taken care of by a letter from <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> to the Prime Minister of Viet-Nam which would state that by July 1, 1955 the Vietnamese National Army will be completely autonomous, specifically that all units of that Army will be staffed and commanded by Vietnamese officers.</item>
<item>This is a matter to be agreed to between France and Viet-Nam but it is also a prerequisite to American financial support of the Vietnamese Army and to American assistance in training that Army.</item>
<item>The second point could in our view be resolved by means of a letter from <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> which would specify that ‘It is agreed that United States personnel will be assigned, together with French personnel, as advisers to and instructors of the Vietnamese armed forces. All US and French advisory and training personnel assigned or detached to the Vietnamese armed forces will be under the direction of the Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> acting under the general authority of <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName>. As the efficiency of the Vietnamese armed forces increases, the number of US and French advisers and trainers will be decreased’. These suggested texts do not in anyway derogate from <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName>’s present authority.</item>
<item>If those two points were satisfactorily resolved, I believe we would both be in positions to move ahead rapidly on an agreed basis, in Viet-Nam.</item>
<item>Since the questions of autonomy of the Vietnamese Army and the role of the United States <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> with respect to training responsibilities could be settled by this means, there would appear to no longer be the necessity of an agreed memorandum of understanding, such as Generals <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> drafted, or along the lines proposed in your subsequent proposed revision and we would be agreeable to having these letters take the place of the memorandum of understanding.</item>
<item>I hope you will agree with me that this suggestion will permit us to end an argument which seems to me increasingly sterile. I also am <pb xml:id="pg_60" n="60" facs="0090"/>sure that you understand that agreement on these two open matters is a prerequisite to the United States making the massive investment to preserve South Vietnam in freedom which is our purpose. Given our common aims and the continued close and cordial cooperation which has marked the relations between <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> in the field I have a growing conviction that we will succeed. With kind personal regards. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster Dulles</persName>.”</item>

<head>27. Letter From the Chargé in France (<persName corresp="#p_ATC1" type="from">Achilles</persName>) to the Counselor of the Department of State (<persName type="to">MacArthur</persName>)<note n="1" xml:id="d27fn1" type="source">Source: Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/2–155. Personal and Secret.</note></head>
<dateline><hi rend="italic"><placeName>Paris</placeName>, <date when="1955-01-27">January 27, 1955</date></hi>.</dateline>
<p>Dear Doug: Thanks for your letter of January 20<note n="2" xml:id="d27fn2"><ref target="#d23">Document 23</ref>.</note> about the continuing French desire to consider alternatives to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. We have never had the slightest doubt as to Washington’s position about this and have lost no opportunities to make it clear to the French.</p>
<p>There have of course been continuing signs of misunderstanding as to what the Secretary had actually agreed to at the December 18 meeting on Indochina. The French seized upon the Secretary’s agreement that <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> should be authorized to exchange views on possible alternatives to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and that they would be permitted to express their conclusions at the next joint go-around on Indochina. When various telegrams from the Department and Saigon began to indicate that <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> had not been authorized to exchange such views with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>, we thought it best to bring the matter to a head so that any misunderstanding could be cleared up promptly. That was the purpose of the Embassy’s most recent telegram on the subject (<gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 3034<note n="3" xml:id="d27fn3"><ref target="#d21">Document 21</ref>.</note>).</p>
<p>The French position is that, as was agreed December 18, they be given a hearing. In accepting this principle we have warned them repeatedly that since our Embassy in Saigon has reported that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has now begun to show signs of improvement they should expect little or nothing from us on alternatives in the next go-around. We have reminded them that, as agreed, any suggestion for an alternative solution would only be considered if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> continued to fail, which we now maintain is no longer the case. This was told Saint-Mleux most recently as reported in our telegram 3034.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_61" n="61" facs="0091"/>
<p>I fear, however, that it will be impossible for us to dissuade <persName corresp="#p_MFP1">Mendès</persName> through <persName corresp="#p_LCGC1">La Chambre</persName>, Cheysson or others from continuing to insist that any plan they may be concocting be given at least a hearing. They have been preparing to bring such a plan to the surface since December 18 and, we are told, their own analysis of the present situation does not permit them to accept our thesis that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s improvement has completely obviated the need for a change of some description.</p>
<p>We shall continue to discourage them to the best of our ability and also seek to force any plan they have out into the open as you suggest. However, we do not believe that they have any definite one as yet. The <persName corresp="#p_LCGC1">La Chambre</persName>–Saint Mieux scheme for a coalition including <persName corresp="#p_TVH1">Tran Van Huu</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NVT1">Tam</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> reported in <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 2866 of January 6<note n="4" xml:id="d27fn4"><ref target="#d9">Document 9</ref>.</note> and confirmed in Saigon 827<note n="5" xml:id="d27fn5">Telegram 827 from Saigon to Paris, January 22, sent to Washington as 2894. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/1–2255)</note> is, we think a <persName corresp="#p_LCGC1">La Chambre</persName>–Saint Mieux trial balloon and may not have <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s approval. It certainly hasn’t <persName corresp="#p_MFP1">Mendès</persName>—yet. Cheysson was definitely inclined to the Buu Hoi formula but is still groggy from the manner in which we slapped that down and hasn’t brought up anything new with us in recent weeks. Bill Gibson is taking him to lunch this week in an effort to smoke him out and will use the occasion to make it clear again that the French need not hold out any hopes for U.S. consideration of any alternative scheme.</p>
<p>As to what is really eating the French, I think it is a combination of factors whose relative importance is hard to evaluate. One is a sincere belief that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is personally incapable of doing the necessary job, has too many cards stacked against him and does not represent even the best available solution. We believe that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s and <persName corresp="#p_DJH1">Daridan</persName>’s reports are along this line. Another is the widespread opinion in Parliament and the press that the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> formula was forced on the Government against its better judgment and accepted only in the general interests of Franco-American relations. <persName corresp="#p_MFP1">Mendès</persName> wishes to be able to point to the fact that he has at least tried to get us to change. The extent to which less creditable motives such as jealousy of U.S. influence in Vietnam, the desire to replace “anti-French” Vietnamese by pro-French ones or more sinister thinking along “<persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName>” lines enters into the picture is hard to say.</p>
<p>We do not think the Department has been at all remiss about letting us know its feelings. We have become increasingly aware of the desire to avoid any serious consideration of alternatives from your recent telegrams and your letter seals it up. It also relieves our mind of the thought that there might be a misinterpretation in <pb xml:id="pg_62" n="62" facs="0092"/>Washington of what the Secretary agreed to on December 18. Having your specific statement that we are unprepared to put forward any alternative solution ourselves or to consider any put forward by the French helps us considerably in our task of dealing with the French on the problem. I am sure we can help further in preparing for what is to come without in any way backing away from the understandings reached in the December 18 talks. The Department’s suggestion that the next go-around take place in Bangkok in conjunction with the Manila Pact meeting is, in my opinion, excellent, and our first approach to the Quai on it was well received. We note that <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> has already agreed to it and trust this will help persuade the French and permit us to confirm acceptance in a day or so.</p>
<p>Again thanks for your helpful letter.</p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>

<p>At this point the Vice President was obliged to leave the meeting. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> entered, together with other specially invited people, including the Service Secretaries and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> how long he would have to make his oral report. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> asked how long <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> wanted. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> replied, twenty minutes.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> said his oral report would be divided into three main parts. First, the situation as he had seen it when he got to Saigon; second, the seven-point program for Vietnam agreed between him and the French Commander-in-Chief, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName>; and third, the major factors upon which the outcome for Free Vietnam would depend. He would conclude, he said, with a discussion of dollar figures and costs.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> said that when he arrived in Saigon he confronted a situation of open rebellion, of which General <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName> was the instigator. He had succeded in stopping this rebellion promptly, and ultimately got <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName> out of the country. When he had reached France, <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName> had been stupid enough to offend <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. This finished him off, for the time being at least.</p>
<p>Once <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName> was out of the way, things began to pick up, and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> said that he could move ahead on the seven-point program which he would now describe. First of the seven points was <pb xml:id="pg_64" n="64" facs="0094"/>the program to nationalize the Vietnamese armed forces and to deal with the splinter armies which were being maintained by the sects, the Cao Dai, etc. He had done this, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> said, by announcing simply that the United States would support but one army, the Vietnamese National Army. Things were now being squared away, and if only <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName> keeps out of the way the outlook will be very favorable.</p>
<p>The second point: The Vietnamese National Army, which had formerly been concentrated in and about Saigon, was now in the course of being deployed throughout the country, with the duty of carrying out the so-called “national security program”. This involved taking over civilian control in various areas from the Vietminh. Success in this enterprise was fundamental to a favorable solution for Free Vietnam.</p>
<p>The third point in the program involved the reorganization of the national armed forces of Vietnam. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has formally requested the United States to undertake the training of this army at a level of 100,000 personnel.<note n="5" xml:id="d28fn5">The text of the communiqué released by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> on January 20 announcing and summarizing this request is in telegram 2877 from Saigon, January 21. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.5–MSP/1–2155)</note> The new Defense Minister, <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName>, must be regarded as promising.</p>
<p>The next important point in the seven-point program had to do with the resettlement of refugees from the Vietminh-controlled area in the north. 500,000 such refugees had already fled from North Vietnam to the south. It was quite a thrilling sight, added <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName>, to see the refugee camps. While their squalor was disheartening, one took courage from the fortitude of these people who had so prized liberty and democracy that they had fled from their homes. The great problem was now where to settle them in places were they could earn a living, or how to get them onto the land. To complicate matters, 100,000 additional refugees were anticipated before the closing date in April and May.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the next point in the seven-point program was closely connected with the resettlement problem the program for agrarian reform. This program, said <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName>, would be announced very shortly. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s regime feels that it can seize land not now under actual cultivation and hold such land over a period of three years. Thereafter the tenant holders might conceivably acquire actual ownership through recourse to loans from capital agrarian banks which are to be established. This was a vital program.</p>
<p>The next point involved the creation of a Vietnamese National Assembly. For the moment, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> was the only existing source of legal power in Vietnam. He could even fire <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> if he were so <pb xml:id="pg_65" n="65" facs="0095"/>minded. Accordingly, it was the more imperative to create a National Assembly as rapidly as possible. Since free elections to such an assembly were not possible under present conditions, the idea was to create at once a provisional and appointive assembly, rather than an assembly with constituent powers. The first thing that a constituent assembly would do would be to throw out <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, and he cannot be spared just yet. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> expressed the hope that the convocation of the provisional assembly could be announced by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> within the next month.</p>
<p>The next point in the program had to do with fiscal and economic conditions in Vietnam. As a result of recent conferences in Paris, Vietnam was now a truly free country from an economic point of view for the first time. While much remains to be done, the economy seems to be on the right track. There will be an obvious need for U.S. financial advisers, and we must remember that the French are very sensitive to American participation in the financial affairs of Vietnam.</p>
<p>The next field is one which the French themselves have introduced: the program for cultural relations and education. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> pointed out that here again the French were very sensitive about retaining their cultural leadership. He said, however, that he firmly believed in the wisdom of Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>’s recent contract with the Michigan State University, which is establishing at Saigon an Institute of Public Administration.<note n="6" xml:id="d28fn6"><p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FWR1">Wesley R. Fishel</persName> of Michigan State College (later University) met <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in 1950 and became a close personal friend. At <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s request, <persName corresp="#p_FWR1">Fishel</persName> came to Vietnam in August 1954 as a consultant to the Vietnamese Government and to <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and arranged for a survey team of four <gloss target="#t_MSU1">MSU</gloss> faculty members to tour Vietnam. In October the team recommended the creation of a technical assistance program in public administration, economics, public information, and police administration as a supplement to existing U.S. assistance. (Arthur F. Brandstetter, James H. Denison, Charles C. Killingworth, and Edward W. Weidner, Chief of Mission, “Report of the Special <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> Mission from Michigan State College for Public Administration, Public Information, Police Administration, and Public Finance and Economics” (Saigon, October 16, 1954) (mimeographed) is in Michigan State University Archives and Historical Collection, Hannah Papers, UA 2.1.12, Box G, Vietnam Project 1954)</p>
<p>In two contracts between Michigan State and the <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> and the Government of Vietnam, signed in April and May of 1955, respectively, <gloss target="#t_MSU1">MSU</gloss> was authorized to send up to 30 people to Vietnam, where most of its personnel were placed on the rolls of the National Institute of Administration. The public information proposal was not implemented, and the program in economics was small in comparison to the two principal projects in public and police administration. The first report of the team, dated August 19, 1955, is in Department of State, <gloss target="#t_FESEA1">FE/SEA</gloss> Files: Lot 58 D 266, Vietnam 1955 and 1956.</p>

<p>Last in the seven-point program was the effort to broaden the base of the present government. As of the present, the sects have far too large a representation, in view of their lack of genuine interest in effective government. Some little progress has been made in broadening this base, but Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is reluctant to take anyone into his cabinet who he views as a potential rival. This, of course, includes the best candidates.</p>
<p>Upon completing his discussion of the seven-point program, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> recapitulated the five factors in his written report, upon which he believed the outcome of the struggle to save Vietnam would depend.</p>
<p>The last portion of <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName>’ report dealt with the United States assistance program. He spoke from two charts, the first entitled “The Vietnamese Budget for Calendar Year 1955”; the second, “Cost Estimates: U.S. Support of Vietnam”. The figures in the latter chart were identical with those set down in his written report, said <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName>, and he described this as the “proposition” he had recommended to <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> stated that he certainly did not wish to appear to be too optimistic, but if all the things which he recommended were carried through, there was at least a 50–50 chance of saving South Vietnam from the Communists.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName>’ oral report, the President asked Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> whether he had enough funds for Fiscal Year 1955 and Fiscal Year 1956 to take care of the assistance program as outlined by <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName>. Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> replied in the affirmative</p>
<p>The President then turned to <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> and said that the one thing which he had failed to give in his report was his own guess as to what the Vietminh were likely to do in Free Vietnam. In reply, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> stated that the French had recently obtained a report on this subject which they regarded as very trustworthy. This report indicated the intention of the Vietminh for the time being to lie low in Free Vietnam and observe strictly the rules of the game agreed upon at the Geneva Conference. However, said <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName>, if the so-called national security program for Free Vietnam really worked out and the control of the Vietminh was seriously challenged in Free Vietnam, the Vietminh might well consider resort to overt military action to assure themselves of gaining or retaining power over Free Vietnam.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_67" n="67" facs="0097"/>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then pointed out to the Council that the Planning Board had discussed at a recent meeting the contents of <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName>’ written report, and had recommended as a result possible Council action on various points raised in the report.<note n="7" xml:id="d28fn7">A list of the recommendations resulting from the Planning Board’s meeting on January 26, along with comments by the Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs, are in a memorandum by <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName>, “Major points for <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> consideration of <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName>’ report on Viet-Nam of January 27, 1955”, January 26. (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Files: Lot 62 D 1)</note> He indicated the nature of the recommended Council actions. The first of these recommended actions called for a reaffirmation by the signatories of the Manila Pact. Assistant Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> expressed the opinion that it was essential for the future of Free Vietnam that the validity of the Manila Pact be reaffirmed.</p>
<p>The second action recommended by the Planning Board called on the United States to continue to press the French Government to carry out their part of the Minute of Understanding between the U.S. and France agreed to last September in Washington.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> expressed the opinion that it was probably impossible to get an absolutely clear decision on Vietnam from the French. The difficulty was getting the French to realize that if Free Vietnam is to be saved the United States will save it. In any case, we could not have a showdown with the French because they will never agree to one. We will accordingly have to live with the problem as an evolutionary process in the course of which the French will come to realize the essential role of the U.S. in saving Vietnam. This did not mean, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, that we should not continue to prod the French to live up to their agreements.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> cited <persName corresp="#p_LCGC1">M. La Chambre</persName>’s recent visit to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, in the course of which he urged the latter to return to Saigon.<note n="8" xml:id="d28fn8">For more detail on the purpose of <persName corresp="#p_LCGC1">La Chambre</persName>’s meeting with <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, see <ref target="#d15">Document 15</ref>.</note> It was this kind of thing that was so disturbing about the French attitude. Moreover, continued <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName>, the French are now attempting to walk out on the Memorandum of Understanding concluded between himself and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName>. These are things which we must try to get the French to put an end to.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> indicated that he planned to discuss these matters at the ministerial level at the forthcoming Manila Pact meeting in Bangkok.<note n="9" xml:id="d28fn9">February 23–25.</note> Discussion was not practical at an earlier date, and he anticipated strong support from <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony Eden</persName> at Bangkok.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_68" n="68" facs="0098"/>
<p>The third and fourth recommendations of the Planning Board elicited no discussion by the Council, and were promptly agreed to.<note n="10" xml:id="d28fn10">In recommendation 3 the Planning Board suggested continued support of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> under present conditions and in recommendation 4 suggested endorsement of the <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> seven-point program.</note></p>
<p>With respect to the fifth recommendation—calling for careful preparations to meet the eventuality of the all-Vietnam elections to be held in July 1956—Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that it was altogether illusory to imagine that the United States could possibly succeed in getting any agreement by the Communists for calling off these elections, which were part of the Geneva Accord. There were, however, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, other techniques, many of which were very familiar to the Soviets, for preventing the holding of these elections.</p>
<p>The sixth recommendation of the Planning Board, which called for approval in principle of the programs for U.S. military and non-military aid to Vietnam, as well as approval of the general magnitude of the costs of these programs, occasioned a general discussion of the costs of the program and of the availability of funds. In the course of the discussion, Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said he could reassure the Council that he had resources available to carry out the program and the costs indicated by <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName>, while at the same time carrying out comparable programs for Laos and Cambodia. Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said his immediate concern related to the attitude of the French toward our proposed support of the French Expeditionary Corps. We had indicated that we would provide only $100 million for this purpose, and the French had replied that if we gave no more than this amount they would be obliged to cut the level of the Expeditionary Corps below the agreed number of 75,000.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> said that it would create a serious problem if the size of the French Expeditionary Corps were drastically cut prior to a solution of the problem presented by the elections in Vietnam in July 1956. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, on the other hand, expressed the view that the French were bluffing. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> agreed with him that it would not be in the interests of the French themselves to cut the size of their Expeditionary Corps much below the 75,000 figure. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> agreed with these views, and Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> expressed the opinion that he should stand on the offer of $100 million.</p>
<p>With respect to the Council’s action approving as a general order of magnitude the costs of the program of assistance to Vietnam which he had presented, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> expressed the hope that he could be given some sort of definite figure before he returned to Saigon next Thursday. Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> stated that he was ready to <pb xml:id="pg_69" n="69" facs="0099"/>recommend a figure now to the President if the State Department agreed to it.</p>
<p>As to the last Council action recommended by the Planning Board—namely, the reaffirmation of the validity of our policy on Indochina set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5429/5, which called for the U.S. to take all feasible measures to save Vietnam—the President observed that this was a good deal like repeating the Doxology.</p>

As regards letter from <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>, French Govt prefers combine first two sentences US suggested draft to read as follows: “It is agreed that all US and French advisory and training personnel assigned or detached to the Vietnamese armed forces will be under the direction of the Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> acting under the general authority of the Commander in Chief”. <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> reiterated reasons (second para <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss><note n="3" xml:id="d29fn3">While there is no indication in the source text of the specific number of the reference telegram, <persName corresp="#p_ATC1">Achilles</persName> is apparently referring to telegram 3173 from Paris, January 27, in which he reported concern by an unnamed Foreign Ministry official (whose position in the Quai d’Orsay coincided with <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName>’s) that <persName corresp="#p_MFP1">Mendès-France</persName> was under increasing pressure at home to insure that the Geneva Accords were strictly observed.

<p>The Mutual Security Act of 1954 provides under Section 121 that funds authorized and appropriated thereunder are to be made available on such terms and conditions as the President may specify for expenses necessary for the support of forces of nations in the area of Southeast Asia and for other expenditures to accomplish in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific the policies and purposes declared in the Act. Under Executive Order 10575, dated November 6, 1954, any utilization of these funds in excess of $150,000,000 for Indo-China, or in any amount for purposes other than for Indo-China, must be approved by the President.</p>
<p>In order to carry out in Vietnam the recommendations of the Special Representative of the President, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName>, and for parallel action in Cambodia and Laos as recommended by the United States country teams in those countries, it is recommended that, in furtherance of the policies and purposes of the Mutual Security Act of 1954 in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific, the President approve from funds appropriated pursuant to Section 121 of that Act the additional allocation of up to $324,800,000 to the Director, Foreign Operations Administration, for the purpose of providing further assistance to Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam.

<p>The amounts for Direct Forces Support to Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam provide for calendar year 1955 financing of aid heretofore made available through France. The cost estimates are based on national force levels considered necessary to accomplish a twofold mission: the establishment and maintenance of internal security; and the capability of providing sufficient initial resistance to external attack to prevent the countries from being rapidly overrun before outside assistance can be brought to bear. As further security until national forces have achieved the requisite military effectiveness, it is proposed that the United States help defray the costs of the French Expeditionary Corps.</p>
<p>Unlike direct forces support, Defense Support assistance has been channelled directly to the three States since inception of the programs in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1951. Both the character and scope of assistance, however, have been substantially changed in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955. Some $45 million has been programmed for aid to Vietnam for evacuation, relief and resettlement of about half a million refugees from areas north of the 17th parallel. An additional $55 million, distributed among the three States as indicated above, will provide continuing support for projects of proven value initiated in earlier years and for an expansion of activities needed to strenghthen the governments and economies of the three countries.</p>
<p>Both the magnitude and types of assistance proposed for financing in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 are considered to be essential to the achievement of the major objectives underlying <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName>’ 7-point program for Vietnam and the parallel actions recommended by the United States country teams for Cambodia and Laos.</p>
<p>The Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense and the Director of the Bureau of the Budget concur in the recommendation contained in this memorandum.<note n="3" xml:id="d31fn3">According to telegram 3366 to Saigon, February 9, <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> approved this request on February 3.

Hoa Hao representatives of Gen. <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> returned Saigon February 1 from <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> ceremonies at Tay Ninh deeply disturbed by reports they had heard.

They warned that if <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Trinh Minh The</persName>’s forces were used against <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName> other Hoa Hao forces would defect and join <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName> against government and The.</p>
<p>We are informed <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName> ambushed nationalist forces in Long My area January 30/31 killing three officers and wounding 30 men.

<p>3162. <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName> on <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ instructions discussed with Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> question of National Guard of 65 thousand as apparently envisaged by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> informed <persName corresp="#p_OD1">O’Daniel</persName> he believes proper solution a National Gendarmérie of approximately ten thousand, that provinces should provide own police out of provincial budgets, but that as President has his own definite ideas on subject, it would be better approach him directly.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_OD1">O’Daniel</persName> and I spent two hours discussing matter with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> today. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> opened conversation by showing us breakdown of proposed provincial security forces totalling 47,650, of which in round numbers 16 thousand are Provincial Auxiliary Guard in South Vietnam, 13 thousand local provincial forces in Central Vietnam, 12 <pb xml:id="pg_77" n="77" facs="0107"/>thousand militia from North evacuated to South, and 6300 northern militia still in Haiphong enclave. These would not, he said, be a unified National Guard but local security forces.</p>
<p>We made clear to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> position as already expressed to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> immediately prior <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> departure that US cannot support a militia force of size envisaged and at same time support National Army even with reduction in numbers as planned.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> went into great detail to justify what he states is necessity retain provincial troops under direct command of provincial chiefs. He argued National Army is not yet competent take over special role of militia who have advantage of proper type training, of being directly responsible Chief of Province, and of knowledge of local conditions. Chief of Province would be able to use army forces only after getting special permission through military channels and army not numerically large enough to secure the vast areas of Central and South Vietnam. As example, President pointed to difficulty with Hoa Hao dissident <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName> and said it necessary, if National Army is to surround and defeat <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName> forces, remove troops from many surrounding areas which would be left without protection were it not for provincial militia. Provincial militia enable local authorities act with greater dispatch and provide method Chief of Province keep localized banditry under control. He alleges provincial chiefs are unanimous in support his point of view. (<hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: They doubtless subjecting him to strong pressure.)</p>
<p>President’s convictions are very strong on this subject. In reply suggestion that during period between now and September when army remains at level of 150 thousand he might be able progressively reduce local militia, he said that army still untested and untrained, that, with regard to militia from North, he is under moral obligation keep his promise, given them as inducement to leave North, that they would be retained on payroll. Also militia has civil status which makes it impossible demobilize them in same way as military. He maintains it not feasible change status of military so that provincial chiefs would have direct authority over army forces in their areas. He elaborated on background of militia forces pointing out that they are of long historical tradition and that, contrary to propaganda spread by General <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName>, he had no intention of creating force which would oppose army. His intention was to codify all previous militia systems and build up organization based on already established provincial forces. Such force could in no way threaten a strong centralized National Army, although to be effective it would require rifles as well as side-arms.</p>
<p>I am convinced <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> intends remain adamant on this subject, and, if it not possible reach any reasonable compromise such as progressive reduction which would satisfy him, it will take drastic pressure <pb xml:id="pg_78" n="78" facs="0108"/>on our part to make him change his concept and base his pacification and local security program entirely on territorial battalions as proposed in present organization plans for National Army.</p>

<p>3253. On eve <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ return, there is general impression atmosphere Free Vietnam has begun to lighten. There is a quickening of almost reluctant optimism in spite of heavy and dark clouds yet remaining. While country is far from reaching hypothetical line where its security and future may be considered even fairly safely assured, it is believed low point has been reached and trend, at least for moment, has begun to turn upward. Upward is relative term in this case, but that is direction.</p>
<p>It is difficult to realize weight of various factors which have contributed to this state affairs and following is in no sense attempt canvass all major elements of this particularly complex picture. Principal point to be emphasized is period of deep depression has been replaced by period of guarded optimism. This impression has been commented on to me by numerous observers including, for example, Director of Hong Kong–Shanghai Bank on visit from Hong Kong; Director of Shell Oil Company on visit from London; Harriot, editorial writer of <hi rend="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</hi>, and several influential French businessmen.</p>
<p>Certain points may, however, be highlighted:</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ mission and constancy of US support of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government have played critical role. National Army and Government are in relative harmony in most areas, although potential causes for renewed trouble remain. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has given evidence of unexpected personal popularity, particularly in center but also in south. Here we must guard against using our own propaganda efforts as measure of this new popularity. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s new self-confidence, however, has helped create more optimistic atmosphere as have evidences that at least some dissident groups believe it politic get on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> bandwagon. In spite of tragedy for Vietnam of Geneva Accords, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has <pb xml:id="pg_79" n="79" facs="0109"/>been able establish fact of full sovereignty Free Vietnam and population is becoming increasingly convinced of this independence. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s well-known anti-French sentiments, his honesty and stubbornness of purpose have proved valuable adjuncts.</p>
<p>Against above must be balanced weaknesses of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> as leader, which have often been reported by this Embassy and extremely serious potential dangers from vast refugee resettlement program, from Viet Minh infiltration and subversion, from increasingly stormy activities of sects, and from machinations of politicians supporting persons such as former President <persName corresp="#p_TVH1">Huu</persName>. A little progress has proved to be a heady draught for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and he is showing tendency with newfound self-confidence, a confidence not entirely shared by all, to take on all comers at once. This is cause serious concern for his well-wishers and very possibly may drive together widely disparate elements opposed to him. Given stability, wisdom and decisiveness, however, he now has better atmosphere in which attempt carry forward constructive programs.</p>

<p>3267. In his current troubles with Hoa Hao, General <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> now needs some money and needs it fast. The amount is 5 million piastres which <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> undertakes to repay in future.</p>
<p>Problem is this: Regular government payments to <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> and Hoa Hao are now overdue. Each payment is approximately 5 million piastres reduced by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> from formerly higher figures. Both groups are pressing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> with increasing urgency. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> can’t withdraw funds from National Treasury to pay one without paying other, US transaction would be clearly recorded on books.</p>
<p>In highly oriental fashion, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would like borrow 5 million piastres which he could slip under table to Cao Dai, keeping him [<hi rend="italic">them?</hi>] happy, while allowing <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> to whistle for his money.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has good reason currently not wish provide <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> with funds inasmuch as he suspects, with good reason we believe, that <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> will probably use funds deriving from government in his current <pb xml:id="pg_80" n="80" facs="0110"/>activities against government, probably including passing on sum of money to <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName> who is on verge of open warfare with National Army.</p>
<p>We are not very resourceful at this moment in thinking up where <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> can dig up 5 million piastres, half of which he needs by weekend February 12 and remainder by weekend February 19. We have assured <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that US Government does not normally do business this fashion. His reply is that this is not normal situation.</p>

While there is slight possibility that recent improvements in South Vietnam may produce slightly more favorable atmosphere and while passage of time since Geneva may be producing slightly less all black and all white view of elections in relation to Geneva Agreement, paramount objective of French Indochina policy under any government will certainly be to avoid any risk of reopening hostilities. We also believe any successor government likely be more rather than less sensitive regarding US role in Vietnam and Cambodia. Nor do we anticipate any early lessening of French efforts to maintain its economic interests and cultural <pb xml:id="pg_81" n="81" facs="0111"/>influence in North Vietnam without reference to personal factors (<persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName>).</p>
<p>We will reappraise our views as soon as possible after <persName corresp="#p_MFP1">Mendes</persName>’ successor obtains Parliamentary approval but we believe it would be unrealistic to anticipate any substantial changes. Most important single means of influencing any successor government toward our objectives will be to demonstrate with maximum clarity that our intentions are not bellicose and that over long-term, we are placing greater reliance upon developing indigenous Asiatic resistance to Communism than upon western armed force to prevent further Communist expansion. Next most important will be to convince French that US not seeking replace France as mentor and protector of Associated States but that on contrary, we fully recognize French interest in Indochina and expect France to share with us responsibility of achieving our major joint objectives.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.13/1–2555) <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> responded in a letter of February 3, that he was assigning <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> to Vietnam for “about two months”. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> <gloss target="#t_FESEA1">FE/SEA</gloss> Files: Lot 58 D 266, Miscellaneous Memos)</note> I called on <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> told me he had received from Paris texts of letters he would address to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> on organization Vietnamese armed forces and to me, on full responsibility of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Chief for training of Vietnamese forces, as well as text of joint recommendation he and I would make to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> on organization of Vietnamese armed forces. He said he would make his texts available to me at once (which he subsequently did), and that as soon as we had compared versions approved by Paris and Washington, we could have documents prepared in final form for signature. This should be accomplished 10th or 11th.</p>
<p>2. I showed <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> Washington drafts of proposed exchange of notes with Vietnam on direct forces support, proposed exchange of notes with Vietnam on return of military equipment, and draft letter <pb xml:id="pg_82" n="82" facs="0112"/>from me to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> stating U.S. intent to support military program for calendar year 1955 and economic programs for U.S. fiscal year 1955.<note n="3" xml:id="d37fn3">See <ref target="#d31fn3">footnote 3, Document 31</ref>.</note> <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> sought and received assurance that these notes had no effect of modifying arrangements made between <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and me; otherwise he offered no comment.</p>
<p>3. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he was concerned that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> govt was taking strong line against <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and inspiring propaganda effort against it. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> says <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> has been not unuseful and fears that if govt openly blocks its work in South either Poles or Canadians may withdraw, former to add to confusion and increase difficulties of non-Communist side, and latter feeling they can no longer play useful part here. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> govt has strongly opposed <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> proposal to accept Colonel Ha Van Lau as Viet Minh liaison when Commission has next session in Saigon. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> hopes both <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> will agree to substitute for Ha Van Lau. I told <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> I agreed government would be ill advised openly oppose <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>, and would so inform <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>
<p>4. In reply to my query about evacuation of Charbonnages equipment, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said one large mechanical tool was scheduled for shipment that day and that arrangements were being made to evacuate remaining equipment directly from Charbonnages mines rather than from port. He reiterated his earlier statement that he hopes equipment can be moved out. I told him of interest in this matter I had found in Washington and of importance U.S. Govt attaches to its removal.</p>
<p>5. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> brought up subject of Cambodia, asking if my authority extended to that country. When I replied in negative, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he would like to inform me of problem on personal basis and ask my help. He said French intent and desire in Cambodia procure arrangement with respect to armed forces training analogous to that obtaining in Vietnam with difference that French would have primary responsibility. In defense of this argument, he said French are making financial effort in Cambodia relatively greater than that they are making in Vietnam. He believed agreement in principle had been reached on this matter when he and Lachambre were in Washington last September; at least French claim had not been contradicted. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said French do not wish <persName corresp="#p_MCR1">McClintock</persName> to urge Cambodians to ask U.S. to take over training responsibility. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he had had great trouble with French Govt over this issue and hoped that I could help him. I replied only that I had no responsibility for Cambodia.</p>
<p>6. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> at no time during conversation suggested that fall of <persName corresp="#p_MFP1">Mendes</persName> govt had altered his terms of reference or should be cause for delay in implementing our several agreements. He made no mention whatever of reevaluation situation and prospects of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> govt.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_83" n="83" facs="0113"/>
<p>7. Conversation with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> hinged entirely on take-over of Camau peninsula from Viet Minh and current status of sect problem. Evacuation of Camau has gone well and he expects visit city early next week. Present effort of govt is directed against <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName> and to lesser extent against Binh Xuyen. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has told General <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> that when Prime Minister next goes abroad he wishes take <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> and wife with him. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> told me he believed with <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> absent Hoa Hao would disintegrate, partly as result of internal squabbles; nevertheless General <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> was flattered by offer and indicated he would accept.</p>
<p>8. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said Binh Xuyen had been moving “shock troops” into police posts about periphery of Saigon, with apparent intent take action against govt. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_GGLCF1">General Gambiez</persName> he wishes military control of metropolitan region transferred from French to National Army by fifteenth so that army can take necessary measures against Binh Xuyen. Military control of Hoa Hao region is now being passed to National Army without incident following stern threat to reduce General <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName>’s headquarters by artillery fire if Hoa Hao forces resisted National Army take-over.</p>

<p>2. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> letter to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>: “I have the honor to bring to Your Excellency’s attention that the French Government has instructed me to inform you that the autonomy of Vietnamese armed forces will be complete on 1 July 1955, that is to say all units of these forces (cette armee) will be staffed and commanded by Vietnamese officers”. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: We specifically raised question about meaning of words “cette armee” and were assured by <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s assistant that expression in French clearly means “armed forces” referred to earlier in sentence, and not just army.</p>
<p>3. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> letter to me: “My government has instructed me to bring to your attention its agreement with the following arrangements: All American and French training and advisory personnel assigned or attached to the Vietnamese armed forces will be under the direction of the Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> acting under the overall (haute) authority of the Commander in Chief of the French Union forces in Vietnam.

<p rend="sectiontitleital">“Joint Recommendation of French and American Governments Relative to the Organization and Training of Autonomous Vietnamese Armed Forces</p>
<list>
<item>1. The undersigned consider as desirable the adoption by the Government of Viet-Nam of the provisions of Annex ‘A’ attached hereto relative to the initial structure of Vietnamese forces as they should be organized on 31 December 1955.</item>
<item>2. This force structure would be attained by reduction of the strength of Vietnamese armed forces based, as far as possible, on discharge of the least effective personnel, until the structure defined in Annex ‘A’ is achieved. Some adjustments could be made in the rate of reduction in the light of the political and economic situation in Viet-Nam.</item>
<item>3. The undersigned consider that the direction of a program in the fields of organization and training of autonomous Vietnamese armed forces in order to be effective should be entrusted to a single authority; and that, as far as they are concerned, full responsibility for the assistance to be accorded to the Government of Viet-Nam in the organization and training of these armed forces should be assumed by the Chief of the United States <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> on 12 February 1955 under the overall authority of the Commander in Chief.</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_86" n="86" facs="0116"/>
<item>4. American personnel would then be maintained concurrently with French personnel as advisers and instructors of Vietnamese armed forces. As the effectiveness of these armed forces increases, the number of French and American advisers and instructors would be progressively reduced.</item>
<item>5. The undersigned agree that the above provisions ought to be applied in conformity with existing agreements.</item>
<item>6. The present recommendation will be valid subject to approval by the United States Government of a program of direct aid to the State of Viet-Nam.”</item>
</list>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Comment:</p>
<p>a) Annex “A” referred to in paragraph 1 contains 100,000 man force structure outlined in Part II, Embassy telegram 2676.</p>
<p>b) Department will note that parenthetical phrase included in paragraph 6 of text as cited in Reference A is omitted. Paragraph 6 formerly began: “The present recommendation (which will require the approval of the interested governments) etc”. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and I agreed to delete parenthetical phrase since U.S. and French Governments have already approved joint recommendation as title of paper states, and Vietnamese Government has formally proposed identical force structure and has requested that U.S. assume responsibility for advising and training its forces. Phrase therefore serves no useful purpose, and could be interpreted as leaving joint recommendation contingent on further U.S. and French Governmental approval.</p>
<p>5. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is scheduled hold press conference 12th at which he will announce prospective autonomy of Vietnamese armed forces and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> take-over of full training responsibility.</p>

<p>1. The following information and comments are intended to supplement the information contained in reference.</p>
<p>2. The Viet Namese Government estimates that a sum of five million piasters will be required monthly for approximately the next five or six months for payments to the leaders of the <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> and Hoa Hao confessional forces.<note n="3" xml:id="d41fn3">See <ref target="#d35">Document 35</ref>.</note> Leaders of these forces are pressing the Government for the funds necessary to maintain their forces which are outside the National Army. Since the Government does not wish to integrate these forces into the National Army and believes that some means of support must be provided for them temporarily to prevent their turning to banditry. . . . The number of payments that will be necessary is undetermined and will depend on the progress made by the Government in developing the capacity of the National Army to counter any threats of rebellion by the leaders of the confessional forces and upon the determination of some solution for the employment of their troops. The Binh Xuyen are believed not to be included in the Government’s plans in this regard. The most recent information available to this office is that Binh Xuyen General <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> has not approached the President personally to request payment for his forces.</p>
<p>3. The amounts and nature of future payments to Emperor <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> also remain to be negotiated. However, the Government has the firm intention to provide for the support of the royal family on a legal basis by the Viet Namese Government. The best estimate made available to this office is that this will entail payments of about five million piasters monthly to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> beginning in the near future. The Government probably will settle with <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> on payment of a fixed sum in compensation for shutting off his previous sources of income in the Fall of 1954 and will try to secure his approval for smaller monthly payments in the future.</p>

<p>1. Together with representatives Embassy, . . . and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> I have given thought to problem of what U.S. policy should be towards refugees’ continuing escape from Viet Minh area north of 17th parallel following termination of period mentioned Article 14d,<note n="3" xml:id="d42fn3">Article 14, section d, of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam, July 20, 1954, provided for free movement of civilians from either North or South Vietnam until the 300-day time limit for regrouping of troops of the People’s Army of Vietnam or forces of the French Union expired.

We start from the belief that some flow of refugees will continue come south across 17th parallel from Viet Minh territory following May expiration 300-day period. Driven by desire for freedom, Viet Minh oppression, economic stringency, or any other of a multitude of reasons refugees will continue to come south. Question is: How should they be received and cared for?</p>
<p>2. Pertinent factors influencing decision are:</p>
<list>
<item>a. General vagueness throughout Geneva Accords;</item>
<item>b. Sensitivity of French who wish avoid all charges they are violating Accords; and</item>
<item>c. Undesirability create situation where it could be charged U.S. is actively violating Accords.</item>
</list>
<p>3. We believe U.S. should not appear openly involved in program to be set up. Usual type U.S. escapee program with emphasis on “American impact” form of relief, care, and transfer of escapees is unsuitable to this situation.</p>
<p>4. We, therefore, recommend that:</p>
<list>
<item>a. We should assist Vietnamese in developing escapee reception program to be in operation by May 19, 1955;</item>
<item>b. This program should be supported by U.S. funds, . . . ;</item>
<item>c. This . . . and operation should be staffed and carried out by Vietnamese Government.</item>

<p>3537. 1. For some time I have wanted to discuss privately with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> some problems which we have not yet explored. Sunday evening, 20 February 1955, he came alone to Embassy residence at my invitation. As cover for visit, I arranged informal supper with members my mission, who came somewhat later than President.</p>
<p>2. There were three principal subjects which I wished to discuss with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>
<list>
<item>a. Ultimate form of government which he visualized for Vietnam.</item>
<item>b. Possible reaction of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> in event that a republic should be recommended by constituent assembly.</item>
<item>c. Whether Vietnamese Government planned to participate in electoral discussions commencing July, 1955 under terms of Geneva Accord.</item>
</list>
<p>3. It was exceedingly difficult, as usual, to hold President to discussion these three points, which I took up one at a time. As usual, his tendency was to wander off into problems involving sects, Dai Viet Party, and Army. However, I was able to glean his views as follows:</p>
<p>4. A. The President feels that family of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> is so discredited with people of Vietnam that neither <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> nor any member of family would be accepted as constitutional monarch. He believes that the form of government should be a republic along the lines of either United States or Turkey. It was not possible to pin down any details in this regard.</p>
<p>B. In arriving at this conclusion, the President had indicated, as he has done before, his instinctive resistance to any political views contrary to his own. Perhaps anticipating that I would speak of possible position for Dr. <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> in his government, he introduced alleged machinations of Dai Viet Party, of which <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> is member. He said that there are two branches of this party today. The old Dai Viets, and the new, or younger, branch of party. He said Dai Viets were in opposition to government and had tentacles within the sects, particularly the Cao Dai, and within Army. He charged that Dai Viets favored a more vigorous anti-French attitude and a more direct anti-Communist <pb xml:id="pg_92" n="92" facs="0122"/>program. According to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, this latter program would be designed primarily for others personal aggrandizement.</p>
<p>C. I suggested to President that it would be well for him to accommodate himself to opposition parties since, when a constituent assembly was formed, there were bound to be such parties.</p>
<p>D. I asked him how many parties he thought there would be in constituent assembly. He said there would be many. Probably each sect would have its own party, and there would be others.</p>
<p>E. I asked if he had party of his own. He said no, and that he had no intention of forming one. I pointed out that his opponents have said that he is forming a Catholic Party. This he vigorously denied, stating that his real source of strength came from fact that he was not restricted to any one party, but had a broad appeal to all of the common people. He said Dai Viets and sects, lacking real basis for opposition to government, were seizing on fact both he and I are Catholics to raise religious issue.</p>
<p>F. I pointed out to him how difficult it was to manage a republic with many parties in assembly, as is the case in France. He agreed, but reiterated opposition to constitutional monarchy since he felt <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and family would not be accepted again by the people, particularly since <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> had abdicated in 1945. I explored possibility of Bao Long (son of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>) heading monarchy, but <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> again stated that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s immediate family was finished in Vietnam.</p>
<p>G. I asked President when he thought constitutional assembly should be formed. He said it could not be delayed much longer than six months. The provisional assembly would meet in a month or six weeks. Sects would press at once for election of constituent assembly. They felt—and he tacitly accepted truth of this—that present government under <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would more and more reduce the special privileges of sects. Sects felt that through representation in constituent assembly they would be able to counter this tendency. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> added that many intellectuals would join in pressure for an early election of constituent assembly.</p>

<p>976. Reference: Department telegram 2956 to Paris, repeated Saigon 3607.<note n="2" xml:id="d45fn2"><p>This telegram, February 21, contained the text of a letter, dated February 19, from <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. in the letter the President noted the “distinct progress” being made in Vietnam by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and his government, stressed the need for carrying out announced programs of land reform and military reorganization, and expressed his concurrence in <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName>’ recommendation to continue and expand support for Vietnam. The last paragraph reads: “It is encouraging for me to know that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is making substantial progress. The United States Government intends to continue its support of his Government.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/2–2155)</p>

<p>1. If President’s letter to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> has not yet been delivered, I request that Embassy officer who makes delivery inform Chief of State I am concerned with recent activities of Binh Xuyen who control police and Sûreté.</p>
<p>2. I am informed Binh Xuyen are intriguing with Hoa Hao to hamper efforts of government to consolidate its position. Both are intent on maintaining their special privileges and armies at expense of nation as a whole. By concerting their efforts and utilizing the police power, Binh Xuyen and Hoa Hao could for example block rice shipments into Saigon. At present <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> appear offer less threat to government than other sects.</p>
<p>3. I believe it would be highly useful if <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> saw fit to revoke the decree by which he assigned control of the police and Sûreté last year to the Binh Xuyen. Any such move should of course be coordinated in advance with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>
<p>4. I am making this suggestion on my own initiative and not at request of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, although I am confident it is in accord with Prime Minister’s desires.</p>
<p>5. Request Embassy Paris inform me if it is too late to combine delivery this message with President’s letter.<note n="3" xml:id="d45fn3">In telegram 3617 from Paris, February 26, the Embassy reported it was sending a representative to Cannes to deliver <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s letter to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and would also deliver <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ message.

<item>Status of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government</item>
</list>
<p>Following luncheon on February 28 given in honor of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHS1">Hensel</persName>, the Ambassador discussed with his guests his views on the progress made by the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government and the substantial improvement in the situation during the past month to six weeks. He commented on the close French-American cooperation which had resulted in the reform plans of the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government. These plans however, he said, had yet to be translated from paper into action. Referring to the 7-point French-American program in support of the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government, he admitted sorrowfully that we had failed to make progress in one particular field—the broadening of the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government. He mentioned the promise of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to take <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> into the Ministry of the Interior but the subsequent change of mind by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. He said that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> advances all sorts of reasons for failing to take men like <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> into the Government, and stated his belief that the real reason is <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s fear of letting any strong man who might endanger his, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s position into the Government.</p>
<p>In discussing broadening the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government, the Ambassador said he found it entirely natural that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is unwilling to take into his Government any persons who also hold French nationality and who have not been willing to renounce it. To take such people into the Government would be politically unacceptable to the Nationalist in Vietnam.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> and Ambassador Bonnet said that they agreed in general with what the Ambassador had said but dissented only with regard to the possibility of taking into the Government persons who also hold French nationality. They believe that that is not an insurmountable problem and that the Vietnamese should take the example of India and use able men who have cooperated with former regimes—the British in India or the French in Indochina.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Status of information on Viet Minh truce violations</item>
</list>
<p>Viet Minh violations of the Geneva Accords fall into the two fields of the introduction of arms and of restraining persons from freely moving to the South. The latter has now been largely remedied with comparatively few complaints registered. The introduction of arms, as charged by the French, has been declared by the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> to no longer be taking place.</p>
<p>The following is an extract from <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> paper D–93/2,<note n="2" xml:id="d47fn2">This paper, January 31, is <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Files: Lot 62 D 1, Far East, U.S. Policy Towards, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ Report on Vietnam.</note> regarding violations through the introduction of arms:</p>
<p>“Reliable intelligence reports received through French sources clearly indicate that a considerable amount of Chinese war material has been moved into North Viet-Nam from Communist China since the Armistice. Virtually all of this movement occurred via the uninspected points of Cao Bang and Dong Dang on the Sino-Viet-Nam border. Illicit receipt of war material reached a peak in later July and August and continued at a reduced rate at least through mid-October. Shipments of non-prohibited material, such as gasoline and quartermaster supplies, are continuing at a relatively high level. Since the entry into force of the Agreement, the Viet Minh are known to have received illegally more than 150 pieces of field and anti-aircraft artillery, more than 500 mortars, 9,000 automatic weapons, and 500 recoilless weapons, in addition to substantial quantities of ammunition of all types and more than 400 military vehicles.</p>
<p>“It is difficult for the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> to detect or investigate violations of this article, primarily because <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> teams have not been permitted to travel freely in the area around the Chinese border where supplies are received. The fixed team at Lang Son reported on 30 September 1954 that reconnaissance of roads was impossible due to restrictions placed on all movements by local Viet Minh authorities. Moreover these teams are too small to cover fully the lengthy and largely inaccessible border zone.</p>
<p>“The best available U.S. intelligence (based largely on usually reliable French sources) indicates that the Viet Minh army has continued since the Armistice to increase its firepower as well as its combat <pb xml:id="pg_96" n="96" facs="0126"/>efficiency and size. The fact that the Viet Minh is reinforcing its armed forces tends to confirm the reports that a large amount of war material, quite clearly over and above the allowable categories, has entered illegally into the Viet Minh zones despite the system of inspection established under the cease-fire Agreement, and in direct violation of Article 17 of that Agreement.”</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Dulte1">Dulte</gloss> 18. Eyes only Acting Secretary for President from Secretary.</p>
<p>“Dear Mr. President: Am now en route to Manila after two very strenuous days visiting Vientiane, Phnom Penh and Saigon.<note n="2" xml:id="d48fn2">After conclusion of the <gloss target="#t_SEACDT1">SEACDT</gloss> Council meetings at Bangkok, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> made brief visits to Rangoon and Vientiane on February 27, Phnom Penh on February 28, and Saigon on the night of February 28 and March 1.</note> Overall impression is here exists native leadership which if stimulated, guided and supported has good chance to hold the area. In Laos Crown Prince is able and has some able ministers although present Prime Minister<note n="3" xml:id="d48fn3">Crown Prince Savang Vatthana and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KDS1">Katay Sasorith</persName>.</note> is man of hesitations.</p>
<p>Big problem is to clear the Communists out of the two Pathet Lao provinces. It is believed that government has the power to do this but is reluctant to act fearing this may provoke open invasion by Viet Minh or from China. I sought to assure them that Manila Pact would deter such open, armed aggression, and I hope they may act soon as delays merely increase the Communist buildup.</p>
<p>In Cambodia the King<note n="4" xml:id="d48fn4">King <persName corresp="#p_SN1">Norodom Sihanouk</persName>.</note> is vigorous and full of ideas. On the whole he is healthy influence although some of his theories show immaturity. Big problem there is to work out military training arrangements. I spent considerable time working with French at Phnom Penh and Saigon and hope that we can find the solution on lines of our last talk at the White House. This, I know, is not satisfactory from a military standpoint, but it provides a politically acceptable formula which might work and which if it does not work can later <pb xml:id="pg_97" n="97" facs="0127"/>be discarded in favor of something better. At least it would enable us to get going.</p>
<p>In Saigon I was favorably impressed by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> who is much more of a personality than I had anticipated. He is not without defects, but his merits seemed greater than I had thought. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> have done a superb job and I greatly regret that this team is to be broken up. Apparently <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> will shortly be replaced. Great difficulties remain, but magnitude is less than six months ago.</p>
<p>At Manila we are having a meeting of the Ambassadors from all of the Far Eastern area, and I shall spend tomorrow with them, going on to Taiwan the next day. Faithfully yours, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster</persName>.”</p>

<p>3. We orally expressed <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName>’ concern regarding recent activity Binh Xuyen as well as Hoa Hao along lines Saigon’s 976<note n="6" xml:id="d49fn6"><ref target="#d45">Document 45</ref>.</note> and evoked as one possibility of attacking problem the revocation of decrees vesting control police and Sûreté in Binh Xuyen and phased turnover those powers to Vietnamese Government. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s reaction was unenthusiastic as expected; however our suggestion if nothing else served break through his attitude oriental calm. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> then proceeded make abundantly clear to us that he did not think such a move likely contribute to an improvement in political situation South Vietnam and that on contrary he thought such a move would lead to a further deterioration in political situation there. He went on to say that he was seriously concerned over political situation in South Vietnam which he thought nearing civil war with religious overtones. He added this connection that he thought he perhaps had more objective view situation South Vietnam than many of those at Saigon who too close scene. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> brushed aside idea of revoking decrees and taking away police and Sûreté from Binh Xuyen saying that while this could be done easily and while he would have no qualms in doing so said revocation of decrees would only raise question whether <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had men capable taking over these responsibilities. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> thereafter left no doubt in our minds that he did not think <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could take over these responsibilities. In any event <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> said he did not think this way approach problem. He said he only too well aware problem of sects since he had had to contend at times with opposition emanating from these quarters as well as from Catholics. Unfortunately everyone in South Vietnam seemed to have lost sight of Viet Minh menace and absolute necessity all working together if Free Vietnam to survive. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> clearly implied that he thought <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had failed to a considerable extent in the latter respect. This despite fact he regarded <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> as the most honest straightforward Vietnamese that he knew. He said he also recognized importance having Prime Minister in whom United States had full confidence. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> said he had given <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> full powers and freedom of action to choose means to achieve basic objective countering Viet Minh subversion and developing strong Vietnam capable resisting Viet Minh attraction.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_99" n="99" facs="0129"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> then said he wished we would convey message to <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> that he hoped <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> could convince <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> of necessity of trying to get along with the various elements Vietnamese political life in effort achieve government national union. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> made clear he did not think <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> drawing sufficiently on men available who were capable contributing to national effort, nor that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was making sufficient effort reconcile differences between respective elements Vietnamese political life. He emphasized that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> must avoid giving impression he establishing dictatorship and he must avoid precipitating religious war. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> repeated several times that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> must place country above self and must not sacrifice national interest in attempting consolidate his personal position and that of Catholic element at expense of rest of country. He appreciated anti-Viet Minh force represented by Catholic element but nevertheless Catholics represented only small fraction total Vietnamese population and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> must try get along with other elements political life and be tolerant other religions. He emphasized that he thought <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> alienating Vietnamese political and religious elements who could help—and whose help <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> needed if internecine warfare to be avoided—at time when all Vietnamese in Free Vietnam must pull together if they to survive. We said would make known his views to <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> and to Department.</p>
<p>4. In response our inquiry as to whether he had any other views he might care to express <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> replied in negative.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 50. Secretary, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> and others met this a.m. with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d50fn2">This discussion took place in Saigon. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then flew to Manila the same day.</note> Following is summary of principal subjects discussed.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">(1) French Policy in North Vietnam.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> began conversation by expressing his great concern over French policy with respect to Viet Minh. He said French were trying safeguard their economic and cultural interests in North Vietnam in accordance with Geneva Accord. However, he feared they were also <pb xml:id="pg_100" n="100" facs="0130"/>using this as pretext establish political relationship with Viet Minh. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> strongly disapproved of French policy under <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> because would affect position of Government of Free Vietnam in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. He said his government wishes establish close and friendly relations with countries Southeast Asia—mentioned Burma, India, Indonesia—and to gain their support. While appreciating aid from US, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said Vietnam should not depend on US alone but should also have support of neighbors of Vietnam in Southeast Asia. If French policy of developing political relationship with Viet Minh is pursued, it will raise prestige and strengthen position of Viet Minh regime on one hand, lower position and prestige of Government of Free Vietnam. This in turn will make it more difficult for him develop kind of relationship with Vietnam’s neighbors in Southeast Asia. He then read public statement issued by Dufours, head of Tramways in Hanoi, that only obstacle good relations between French and Viet Minh is US. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> inquired of Secretary as to views of US on French policy in North Vietnam.</p>
<p>Secretary replied that in Bangkok, he had expressed strong objections to Bonnet regarding French proposal of turning over 60 percent interest to Viet Minh in French economic establishments.<note n="3" xml:id="d50fn3">An account of this discussion is in <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 14, February 24. (Department of State, Central Files, 396.1–BA/2–2455)</note> Secretary said he told Bonnet this would give Communists good opportunity to blackmail French on French policy in South Vietnam. Bonnet had asked Secretary if elimination French governmental interests in new arrangements for these joint companies would make proposal more acceptable to US, Secretary told Bonnet that having solely private French interests would make proposal less bad, but would still be objectionable from US point of view since French companies could still exert great pressure upon French Government.</p>
<p>Secretary said did not know how this matter would turn out, but French Government was fully informed on our view.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> expressed his personal view that real intention of French in North Vietnam is to develop trade with south China by means of their relationship with Viet Minh. French believe South Vietnam is lost, and even if it is not, their concessions in South Vietnam are disappearing. Therefore, they have nothing to develop here. If Communists take all Vietnam, French concessions will be lost anyway, and they will have no position here whatsoever. Therefore, in Foreign Minister’s view French are trying to establish base in North Vietnam for developing trade with provinces in south China. He compared French concept to British position in Hong Kong.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_101" n="101" facs="0131"/>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">(2) Internal Security.</p>
<p>Most of discussion this morning concerned difficulties created by sects. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> outlined situation in some detail and returned to it number of times during conversation. He pointed out control of Binh Xuyen in Saigon–Cholon area and its control over Saigon police. Also described control of Hoa Hao in southwest provinces. <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> did not seem bother him too much at this stage. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said he was very much concerned over intrigues between Binh Xuyen and Hoa Hao, for he fears they may be plotting some kind combined action against government. He said will take about two months for him to build up National Army to point where Binh Xuyen would not dare take overt action against government. Said it was indispensable that French cease providing munitions and other support to sects. He suspects that French elements in lower echelons are encouraging some of sect leaders into anti-governmental action. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> he should provide him with any information and names on specific instances such encouragement and support. Ambassador said so far he had not received reliable evidence to back up <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s charge. Later in conversation <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said local units French naval forces with small craft are stationed in southwest province in Hoa Hao territory. Because National Army units know French are there, they hesitate move into this area for fear of difficulties with these French units. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> said he would speak to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> immediately about this situation. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said it is essential National Army be assured sufficient ammunition and logistic support to restore security, and was equally essential that supply of ammunition to sects be stopped. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> replied <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could be assured of logistic support from US for National Army and of equipment. He also said he had assurances from <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> that no ammunition was being supplied sect armies.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said he hoped transfer of few remaining territorial commands from French to National Army could be completed in next few weeks. This was important because it would give Vietnamese Government and National Army responsibility for security throughout Vietnam and eliminate confusion or duplication between French and Vietnamese.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">(3) Resettlement of Refugees.</p>
<p>Secretary asked whether this program was in good shape or not. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> replied that, thanks to US, funds were available to maintain these refugees as they arrived for their day-to-day subsistence. Government Vietnam had calculated necessary amount of money in terms approximately 450,000 refugees. Now there appeared would be many more and there would not be enough money. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> <pb xml:id="pg_102" n="102" facs="0132"/>said he had raised possibility in Washington that more funds would be required for additional refugees.</p>
<p>As to permanent resettlement of refugees, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> pointed out program depended upon restoring security in rich rice areas in south-west. This is area controlled by Hoa Hao. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> frankly told <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> program not moving fast enough and should be accelerated to meet May rice crop planting.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">(4) United States Support for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and Free Vietnam.</p>
<p>Secretary expressed satisfaction that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s position is much more secure and favorable in country. Secretary told <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that US Government—President and himself—had great stake in him and in Vietnam. US had through its efforts and aid and moral support contributed to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s present position of security in country. Therefore, it is essential he take those actions necessary to strengthen his government. Since he is now secure, he can afford to bring into his government other men who might otherwise be his political opponents. In time of national crisis, differing elements must work together. Therefore, Secretary said he hoped <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would realize what he does in Vietnam is important to US in cause of freedom throughout world. Internally, Congress and American public opinion have come accept decisions of US support for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and Free Vietnam. Policies his Government will largely determine continuation this support. Internationally position <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government also important because if there is failure here, US prestige will be gravely affected. Secretary also told Prime Minister that French Government now gives evidence of supporting him and not seeking to change him. Secretary explained that during past few months French Foreign Minister has always wanted to discuss what we were to do if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> failed. They have now dropped that subject from the list.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s response to Secretary’s statement regarding necessity for bringing highly qualified people into his government was to repeat what he had said about problem of security and difficulties with sects. He stressed again that people of Vietnam must have feeling of security and guarantee of such security was most important task facing him and his government.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Security in Viet-Nam and All-Viet-Nam Elections</item>
</list>
<p>The Secretary, after an opening exchange of amenities, assured Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> of the complete support of the United States Government for the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government and of his satisfaction with the increasing position of strength in which the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government finds itself. He likewise informed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> that at Bangkok he had been assured by the French representatives there, particularly Ambassador Bonnet, of the French Government’s final determination to give its full support to President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>
<p>The Secretary asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> for his estimate of the situation. In reply Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> outlined the extremely weak position in which the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government found itself when it was inaugurated during the Geneva Conference at a time when it controlled neither the army nor the police and did not have the support of the sects with their armed forces. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> then gave a résumé of the development of the government and expressed his belief that it had been largely thanks to the work of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> and the constant support of the United States Government that the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government had been able to surmount the many difficulties in its path. He referred to the removal of General <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName> and the control of the army by President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, and said that little by little the President is now getting control of the sects. However, he emphasized that the remaining great problem in the South is that of security of the provinces. Until such time as the sects are brought under control and National Army units stationed throughout the country it will be extremely difficult to carry out the agrarian reform program and to resettle properly the great numbers of refugees from the North.</p>
<p>The Secretary asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> about elections and the conversations, which, according to the Geneva Accord, should commence in July of this year. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName>’s reply made it evident that the Vietnamese Government has not as yet adopted any firm position. He was not <pb xml:id="pg_104" n="104" facs="0134"/>explicit in expressing his ideas as to exactly what the elections might be or for whom one might vote.</p>
<p>The Secretary referred to the experience of the United States with proposed elections in Germany and Korea and said that in the case of the former we had been discussing the matter for ten years without being able to come to agreement with the Communists in East Germany on what constitutes free elections. He believed that the issue of free elections was all in favor of Free Viet-Nam. Viet-Nam, he said, must be in a position to carry on the conversations with the Viet Minh with a thorough knowledge of Communist tactics. Advisers could be made available who are familiar with the methods that the Communists have used in the past in attempting to frame elections to suit themselves. He said that he did not believe that freedom of election could be assured in the North merely by the supervision of the International Control Commission. Unless freedom from pressure before the elections and freedom from fear of reprisals after the elections can be assured, it is quite immaterial what happens on the day of the actual elections.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName>, in expressing thorough agreement with the Secretary’s views, said that undoubtedly conversations would be carried on for a long time and doubtless without any meeting of the minds as to exactly what the elections should represent. The Geneva Accord, being as vague as it is in its provisions relating to elections, would allow a great deal of such discussion. The Foreign Minister expressed appreciation for the offer of assistance in the matter of elections.</p>

<p>3677. . . . gave Embassy officer copy of recent report . . . on current French/Vietnamese/Viet Minh/<gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> positions toward Geneva Agreements.</p>
<p>Summary of main features of report follows:</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Start Summary:</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_105" n="105" facs="0135"/>
<list>
<item>1) <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> Indians, Poles, some Canadians and Viet Minh convinced French cannot ensure observance political clauses of Geneva Agreements. Conviction result of statements by Vietnamese Government and American diplomatic and military missions that they do not recognize (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>) Agreements.</item>
<item>As result Viet Minh no longer feel protected or bound by Agreements and no longer count on elections. Chinese/Russians urging them free selves from Geneva commitments.</item>
<item>2) Both Viet Minh and Vietnamese permitting ghost facade of Agreements to continue because neither willing assume responsibility for destroying. Urgent measures needed to give new life to treaty.</item>
<item>3) Because <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> understood situation <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">Desai</persName> tried through <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> to obtain from French Government official announcement French would observe political clauses. Fall <persName corresp="#p_MFP1">Mendes</persName> government reinforced belief of those who fear French will default on agreement.</item>
<item><gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> is divided between two tendencies:
<list>
<item>A) Indians wish avoid at all costs brutal, premature ruptures of present procedures fearing resumption hostilities or at least failure Indian arbitration.</item>
<item>B) Poles, and to some extent Canadians, want French officially state whether or not they can guarantee observance of Agreements.</item>
<item>If not, Poles claim ready return Warsaw and Viet Minh will consider selves free of all obligations.</item>
</list></item>
<item>4) Two factors of present equilibrium are disappearing: control of Haiphong zone, Geneva Agreements and <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>.</item>
<item>Viet Minh will certainly not make any move against south until in possession Haiphong.</item>
<item>National Government’s position toward Agreements is inciting Viet Minh to plan means (infiltration) to control south other than election. Such activity will be more or less rapid depending on international situation. Consequently priority goal of French must be to gain time vitally needed to enable south consolidate political situation and strengthen National Army in order be better equipped to face either 1956 elections, a test of strength, or negotiations for other solution.</item>
<item>5) Important French officially announce intentions observe all clauses treaty including final declaration. Must try retain authority of <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>.</item>
<item>Vietnam Government must agree play the game at least in appearance and cease repudiating Agreement.</item>
<item>6) Two suggestions:
<list>
<item>A) That French state at Bangkok intentions fulfill agreements but provide for appeal to <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> if south attacked (even if by internal revolution) prior elections.</item>
<item>B) As date for election discussions approaches, that French make new gesture in favor agreements and help organize discussions.</item>

<p>3695. At request of Hoa Hao General <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> we went to see him this morning, March 4, at his Saigon residence. As we arrived [omission in text] political counselor, was just leaving and there was general atmosphere bustle and scurry of minor functionaries. Hoa Hao Minister of National Economy Luong Trong Tuong was present during conversation with <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName>.</p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> reminded us of continuing difficulties he had been having with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> government and of grave distrust with which he continued to regard <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s intentions toward Hoa Hao in general and <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> in particular. <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> said that following his complaint to us regarding attempt of government to “whittle down” number of <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName>’s troops which were to be integrated into national army government had altered its position and had assured him it would take full 3,000 men previously agreed to from <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName>’s forces. Not one piaster had yet been received from government, however, and <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> was unable pay his men. He said he had positive proof <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had already paid 18 million piasters to <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> and was making “heavy expenditures” in central Vietnam but continued give no answer to repeated Hoa Hao requests for advance of even partial payment for forces. <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> said if troops remained unpaid they could be expected to resort to banditry and acts of force to obtain money.</p>
<p>He wanted us to know, therefore, that he had tried his best to reach understanding with government but because of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s attitude he could no longer be responsible for what would happen.</p>
<p>It appeared clear to us from nature of <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName>’s complaints and rather perfunctory manner in which they were made that he regarded this conversation not so much as appeal to Americans to intervene in his favor with government but as fulfillment his previous promise to inform us before he took any drastic action. We, therefore, inquired <pb xml:id="pg_107" n="107" facs="0137"/>as to just what these events might be for which he was seeking to disclaim responsibility.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName>, although evasive at first, eventually hit on heart of matter by saying he had come to firm decision there must be change of government and inquired if Americans would support a new government headed by “a southerner.” We told him categorically that there could be no question of US support for another government in Vietnam at this time. It was firm and determined US policy to support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> and his government and US policy in this regard was firmer than ever. We must tell him bluntly that if there were efforts to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government by force, US support would be on side of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. we hoped, therefore, that all elements Vietnamese nationalists could and would reconcile their differences peacefully.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> replied that only conditions under which he would consider remaining in <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government and support it would be: (1) <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> must change his “work methods”; (2) “certain Cabinet posts” must be changed; and (3) certain members <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s personal entourage must be eliminated.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> said his decision was firm and that he was leaving immediately after conversation for his territory in south. He wanted us to know he was grateful for American aid to Vietnam and that “no matter what happened he would still regard the Americans as friends.”</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: In light of information which <persName corresp="#p_FWR1">Fishel</persName> has given us that conspirators against government, notably Hoa Hao, Binh Xuyen and former president <persName corresp="#p_TVH1">Huu</persName>, had decided on March 2 to “take action” against government, we believe that conversation was <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName>’s way of living up to his commitment not to take action without telling us. With the constant alarums and excursions which take place on the political scene here it is difficult to determine how much credence to place in the “irrevocable decisions” taken by many of the participants. We believe, however, that the Hoa Hao pot is coming to a boil and it is entirely possible that there may be some disorders. This is an opinion apparently shared by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> as we understand he has recently, without consulting national army General Staff or Commander First Military District, moved two companies Vietnamese national army troops from Phan Thiet into Palace grounds thus tripling defense forces of Palace. These two companies are from forces which revolted in favor of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> during <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> conflict and are equipped with five armoured cars and two scout cars. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, according to <persName corresp="#p_FWR1">Fishel</persName>, has also instructed recently rallied <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> General <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Trinh Minh The</persName> to place his forces around Saigon in such a manner as to bracket Binh Xuyen forces between national army troops in Saigon and The’s men outside the city.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_108" n="108" facs="0138"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has brought about this tense situation by applying pressure to Hoa Hao. Whether or not he is in sufficiently strong position to continue this pressure without causing explosion we will probably learn within brief period of time.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 851G.49/2–1555)</note></p>
<p>1. Apparent from all reports received by Embassy that North Vietnam economic situation has deteriorated materially since take over Hanoi in October 54. This evidenced by black market rate for North Vietnam <persName corresp="#p_PVD1">Dong</persName> which currently reported between 60 and 80 per South Vietnam piaster as compared with forced 30 to 1 conversion rate. In addition to French firms planning leave Haiphong, understand Indian and Chinese merchants now getting out because bleak future and increased taxes. Apparently unemployment increasing. Economic troubles North Vietnam seriously increased by failure rice crop in Tonkin which adds to normal rice deficit. Embassy believes rice shipments to North Vietnam offer best means exploitation. This subject discussed briefly with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> in Saigon.</p>
<p>2. Reports received, including those from Hanoi Consulate, indicate rice crop North Vietnam shortest in recent years. Supply may be as low as 45, when almost million people reportedly starved. Recent Viet Minh action to control supply and price of rice may insure better distribution than in 45, especially to groups Viet Minh favor, so that deaths may be reduced. Already reports starvation deaths in rural areas.</p>
<p>3. Appears Viet Minh will not be able bridge gap before next harvest without substantial outside help. Chinese have already made <pb xml:id="pg_109" n="109" facs="0139"/>shipments to Viet Minh, but apparently not in substantial quantities.</p>
<p>Failure receive adequate supplies this source probably accounts for recent government announcement Viet Minh press proposing facilitate resumption economic relations between North and South. Rice is continuing to move to Haiphong from Saigon, but so far no evidence of substantial movements into Viet Minh area or of stockpiling in excess needs Haiphong before Viet Minh take over.</p>
<p>4. Logical source supply rice North Vietnam is South Vietnam. Believe South Vietnam should be encouraged offer rice to starving people in North under guarantee that recipients fully aware source of relief supplies. If offer accepted, South would gain stature as area where economic conditions favorable. If offer unaccepted, Viet Minh would be guilty before own people and world of starving own people for political purposes. Either action on part Viet Minh could be exploited our advantage propaganda wise. As indicated by reference B South Vietnam would probably agree readily make such offer if funds available to purchase rice.</p>
<p>5. Believe Viet Minh would refuse rice offered under these conditions. However, if offer were accepted, means would have found finance rice shipments. (Barter rice for coal and cement ruled out from exploitation standpoint, since Viet Minh would certainly take full credit for supply and since coal and cement shipments to South would not fully pay for rice shipments to North.) Gifts of rice could not be financed by Vietnam Government or within framework present aid program. Pre-Geneva rice shipments from South to North approximated 100,000 metric tons annually. Believe shipment this quantity in next few months costing about US $10–15 million equivalent in piasters would be approximate order magnitude appropriate program.</p>
<p>6. Believe offer should be made by South Vietnam Government, and if accepted, supplies ostensibly furnished by them. US role should not be publicized. Conceivable US could agree with Vietnam to make available through grant like amount US surplus agricultural products in event Vietnam Government offer accepted. If financial assistance this program were received from other nations, particularly France, Vietnam Government should still reap propaganda benefit.</p>
<p>7. Assume reference A did not seek recommendations in propaganda field covering disparity economic conditions North and South and refugee movement which currently being exploited.</p>
<p>8. USIS strongly concurs.</p>

<p>(1) France and US striving for same objectives in Indochina (halt march of communism) but working at it in different ways. French way is the right way and US would probably realize this in about two or three years when it would be too late.</p>
<p>(2) French presence North Vietnam not inconsistent with French policies South Vietnam, <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> etc.</p>
<p>(3) France definitely thinking in terms of Titoism for Vietnam. If French pulled out of North Vietnam <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> and Russian influence would increase. Admitted French had not accomplished much with Viet Minh and chances of success in weaning Viet Minh away from communism were small. However, while there is still a chance, French believe attempt has to be made.</p>
<p>(4) Stated some forces in local government are more nationalist than Communist. Pictured <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PVD1">Pham Van Dong</persName> primarily as nationalists while Communist forces are <persName corresp="#p_TC1">Truong Chinh</persName> (head of Party) and <persName corresp="#p_VNG1">Giap</persName>.</p>
<p>(5) South Vietnam Government long way from being representative of people. Believed proposed South Vietnam Army would be resounding failure since Vietnamese officers would be same poor quality as they were under French (Debarbot commanded troops in Indochina during latter stages war) and officer corps would collapse in battle. Noted Viet Minh Army greatly politically indoctrinated while South Vietnam Army would feel it had no mission. Therefore if war broke out again South Vietnam Army would fall apart unless backed up by foreign troops.</p>
<p>(6) Emphasized elections would be held and Viet Minh would probably win. Country would either be united or war would break out again. When asked what would happen if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> tried obstruct holding elections, Debarbot humorously replied French would put <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> on ship to France and give him enough money for two years on the Riviera.</p>

<list type="subject">
<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Government en Famille</item>
</list>
<p>The President and I discussed at length the positions of his brothers with respect to the Government.</p>
<p>The President characterized <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">M. Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName> as a “pure intellectual, who writes Latin and Greek better than he does French, and who would prefer to spend his time poring over old manuscripts instead of worrying about political problems.” He asserted that his brother does not play a role in political affairs, but that his contribution is more frequently negative than positive, and that his political judgment is not always correct.</p>
<p>He credited M. Nhu with being one of the moving spirits behind the organization of the Can Lao Nhon Vi (Workers Party). He added that this party consisted at last report of approximately 95 members. He noted that M. Nhu is often accused of forming said party as an instrument for helping his brother politically, and observed that the party actually was formed perhaps two years before he (i.e. the President) returned from overseas. He also attributed to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> the “spiritual backing” of the Quoc Gia Cath Mang (Party of National Revolution), but added that he did not know very much about this group other than that it was not of major political significance.</p>
<p>The President observed that many of his friends had urged him to form a political party to give him a base of support in political affairs, and to put him on equal terms with such parties as the various Dai Viet groups, the <gloss target="#t_VNQDD1">VNQDD</gloss>, and others. However, he has never had time nor the inclination to concern himself with such activities. Furthermore, he cannot say with any accuracy exactly what his brother <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName> had done or is doing in that regard—except that he has not been outstandingly successful.</p>
<p>The President characterized his brother <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Ngo Dinh Can</persName> as a much misunderstood man. He pointed out that M. <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Can</persName> is an invalid whose heart is so bad that he cannot walk 100 yards at a time. <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Can</persName> is the family businessman. That is, he has for years been in charge of administering the family property and looking after their mother.</p>
<p>According to the President, M. Can is active in politics, but only in a negative sense. He defines this in the following terms: “My brother never used to be interested in politics until our eldest brother <pb xml:id="pg_112" n="112" facs="0142"/>Ngo Dinh Khoi was killed, along with his son, by the Viet Minh in 1945. Since that time, <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Can</persName> has become increasingly interested in politics. He is, politically, the wisest of all of us. It is a pity that his health is so bad, that he cannot do this job instead of me. People have come to him for years for advice. Before 1945 they came to him for advice as to what to do with their crops, about their horses, and their businesses, etc. But they used to ask him for political advice too, did he would refuse it to them. After Khoi was murdered, <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Can</persName> started giving answers to political questions that were asked of him. And since his advice was good, people kept coming back to him for more advice. M. Duyen goes to him all the time for advice. I have told Duyen time after time, ‘For heaven’s sake, leave him alone. He is a sick man. Don’t bother him. You are the Governor of the Center, not he.’ But still he continues to go to him for advice.”</p>
<p>I questioned the President about the report that his brother <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Can</persName> had organized “assassination squads” and otherwise engaged actively in politics. He replied that his brother would <hi rend="italic">never</hi> do such a thing and that he was positive that he never had done such a thing. He added that this rumor was first spread by General <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName> last fall, “not because <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Can</persName> had organized such squads, but because <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName> was afraid that if someone asked <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Can</persName> whether he should organize an assassination squad, <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Can</persName> might say yes, and since if he did say yes, my brother would give explicit advice as to how to go about it, General <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName> was afraid. But you may be sure that <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Can</persName> has never done anything of the sort.” The President then characterized <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Ngo Dinh Luyen</persName>, the youngest of the brothers, as “very capable, but very hot tempered.”</p>
<p>The President is extremely sensitive to criticism of his brothers. His reaction to the discussion of <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Can</persName> in particular was one of outrageous defense of a man whom he considers to have been wronged by malicious rumor mongers. He did admit however that he did not have time to check on the activities of his brothers, and that it was possible that they did engage in some activities of which he has no knowledge. He added at this point that he had not had a letter from <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Ngo Dinh Can</persName> since he returned to Viet Nam. “In fact, we have a saying in our family that the skies will fall in when <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Can</persName> writes a letter.”</p>
<p>Although there is no question in my mind of the President’s complete sincerity and honesty in making the above quoted statements, I am equally sure that both <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Can</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> are engaged in political activities of which the President has no knowledge, mainly because neither brother wishes to tell him what he is or has been doing. It is a fact that the three younger brothers (<persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Can</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Luyen</persName>) are afraid of the President. They are extremely careful not to arouse him to anger. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> in particular remembers that his wife was <pb xml:id="pg_113" n="113" facs="0143"/>“asked” to take a vacation in Hong Kong for two months because the President was angered by some of her actions.<note n="2" xml:id="d56fn2">The following note appears at the end of this memorandum: “Certificate.

<p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Walter</persName>: I have been somewhat disturbed over the manner in which our Paris Embassy handled President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s letter to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, and the conversation with <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> re possible revocation of the decree placing control of police and Sûreté in the hands of the Binh Xuyen.</p>
<p>Despite the opportunity to exercise some firm control over the communiqué issued by the <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> Cabinet in Paris, it appears to me that we permitted Nguyen De to twist the entire purpose of the President’s letter. As I understood it, the primary purpose of the President’s letter to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> was to reaffirm our determination to support the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government, and to serve as a subtle warning to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> to cease and desist from undermining the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government. This latter point was to counteract anti-<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> influences that were suspected to be working on <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> at Cannes through <persName corresp="#p_LCGC1">La Chambre</persName>’s visit, and the presence of General <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName> and other anti-<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> characters. By permitting the last paragraph to be inserted in the communiqué, we allowed <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s coterie to make the President’s letter seem to be designed primarily to confirm U.S. recognition and support for <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> as Chief of State.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s Cabinet cleverly wired the communiqué at once to Saigon where it was printed in full in all the native papers before our Embassy here had a chance to advise <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>, or to publish the full text of the President’s letter. The communiqué has had a certain amount of effect on encouraging <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s political opponents in Vietnam. <pb xml:id="pg_114" n="114" facs="0144"/><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> personally does not take this too seriously, but he characteristically underestimates all opposition.</p>
<p>There is no question but that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> has recently had emissaries here stirring up the Sects, including the Binh Xuyen, in opposition to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> (see <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 3757<note n="2" xml:id="d57fn2">In this telegram, March 7, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> specifically referred to Ung An, a member of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s imperial cabinet, who had just returned to Saigon from France. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> Central Files, 751G.11/3–755)</note>). Another aspect of the conversation between our Paris emissary and <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName><note n="3" xml:id="d57fn3">See <ref target="#d49">Document 49</ref>.</note> that disturbed me was the fact that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> was permitted to launch into a spurious criticism of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> along religious lines. This, despite the fact that several of my messages repeated to Paris refute these charges. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has publicly stated that he will guarantee freedom of religion, and at an appropriate occasion I still hope to have him repeat this pledge. Such charges as made by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, if not repeatedly challenged whenever made, could possibly firm up opposition against <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> by dissident elements who are seeking some basis for their opposition that would be acceptable to the public.</p>
<p>My final point is that our emissary should never have even tacitly accepted the suggestion made by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> that I be an emissary between Sa Majesté and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. Needless to say, I have no intention of assuming this role.</p>
<p>My only point in raising these matters with you is that this is one more example of what appears to me to be a lack of appreciation of the true nature of our problems here on the part of whoever handles Vietnamese affairs in the Paris Embassy.</p>
<p>Naturally, I don’t want to start a fight with the Embassy, particularly as I have considerable business to do with the Embassy on my permanent assignment with the Standing Group of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. If you see fit, I would suggest that you might discuss this matter with Livy Merchant, or whoever handles the Paris desk in the Department. It will be perfectly all right with me if you show Livy this letter, although I would not wish it to be circulated in the Department or sent to Paris.</p>
<p>Knowing how many other much more important matters you have to worry about, if you should decide the best thing to do with this is tear it up and throw it in the waste paper basket, that will also be wholly agreeable with me. You have such a nice broad shoulder that it invites weepings.</p>
<p>It was a pleasure to see you out here and to have a chance to work with you in our conferences at Manila and Baguio. I hope you have been able to get some little rest since you returned home.</p>

<p>3797. 1. I called on <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> prior his departure for Paris 10th. He said he was going to make contact with new government and review budget and perhaps political questions. I asked if he had assurance of funds sufficient, with U.S. aid, to maintain <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> troop level he desires. He replied he had no intention of going below 75,000. At present he is evacuating 10 to 14 thousand troops per month, a figure he thinks too high and might give idea that <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> is being withdrawn entirely. He hopes level off shortly to a lower rate which could be steadily continued in event Vietnam Government should decide to request complete evacuation. He feels 75,000 is minimum force with which he can face troubles in South Vietnam if they should occur.</p>
<p>2. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> visited Cambodia and Laos 8th. He feels situation Cambodia is not serious. Agreement appears exist between old and new kings<note n="2" xml:id="d59fn2">On March 3, <persName corresp="#p_SN1">Sihanouk</persName> relinquished his crown in favor of his father who became King <persName corresp="#p_SN1">Norodom</persName> Suramarit.</note> regarding holding elections under conditions favorable to government. <persName corresp="#p_SN1">Sihanouk</persName> thinks he can wage successful election campaign against leftist politicians. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> noted <persName corresp="#p_SN1">Sihanouk</persName> is still in public eye and remains Commander-in-Chief of <gloss target="#t_ARK1">ARK</gloss>.

<p>3. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> had lengthy conversation in Vientiane with Prime Minister Kathay regarding two northern provinces. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said danger that Pathet Lao might be taken into coalition government now seems averted. He had also feared Laos might re-open hostilities under unfavorable conditions in an attempt to establish authority in northern provinces. This danger also seems averted but still occasions him some concern. I asked <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> how he proposed Laos Government get provinces under control. He replied this should be done through diplomatic channels. He said so far only French have protested Pathet Lao activities. He would propose at some stage that Laos appeal to Geneva powers if <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> were unable obtain satisfaction from Laos Government. I said I had impression <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> favored Communist position. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> replied that such impression from outside was understandable. However, Indian position has changed appreciably in favor of non-Communists, and Canadians, long intent on strict neutrality, now appear leaning to this side. This evolution should permit satisfactory solution of Laos problem. Otherwise the Geneva powers might be asked to intervene. I asked what the powers could do. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> replied that ultimate appeal might be made to <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. However, Lao Government must meanwhile be careful avoid appearance of aggression. I asked how under Geneva Accord Lao Government could be labeled aggressor if it took defensive action in its own territory. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said Laotians might in course of military action cross frontiers and lay selves open to charge of technical aggression. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> commented that recent influx of visitors following Bangkok Conference, all of whom proferred advice to governments of the Associated States, may have had somewhat disturbing effect. He summarized his position on Laos as calling for appeal first to <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> then to Geneva powers and only as last resort to <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>.</p>
<p>4. With reference Vietnam, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said political situation was extremely confused owing to action of sects and difference of views within the government itself. I asked him how he evaluated recent sect manifesto.<note n="3" xml:id="d59fn3">On March 1, the <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai Pope</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Pham Cong Tac</persName>, held a press conference and announced that the <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName>, Binh Xuyen, and the Hoa Hao had formed a “United Front of Nationalist Forces” and set forth their manifesto. An analysis of the front and the manifesto is in telegram 3754 from Saigon, March 8. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/3–855)</note> <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> replied he saw it as warning to government. He believes sects do not intend to take military action and that manifesto may have been made for blackmail purposes. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that several emissaries from <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> to the sects had been and perhaps still were on the local scene. However he did not know who they were or exactly what they were doing. He said that while this may not be the <pb xml:id="pg_118" n="118" facs="0148"/>most difficult political period we have gone through, it is that in which most maneuvering has taken place. I commented that some of our people take the sect manifesto seriously, although they do not foresee military action, while others see it rather as a sign of weakness on the part of the sects. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that his advisors were equally divided in opinion. I said to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> the sects’ reaction appeared to me to be inevitable and that we should not be too greatly surprised or disturbed as long as we watched situation carefully and advised Vietnamese Government on countermeasures. I said I had asked my staff to consider if manifesto could be used by government to own advantage against sects through capitalizing on idea of unity and of suppression of private armies and abandonment of feudal system expressed in sects’ manifesto.</p>
<p>5. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> agreed this approach would be useful but added that there was another aspect which concerned him. General <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName>(<persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName>) for example has 15,000 “suppletive” troops no longer paid for by French but must be cared for by <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName>. I said that we hoped for peaceful solution to problem and suggested that troops discharged from sect armies might be placed on the land as part of the agrarian reform. To enable sect leaders bridge awkward hiatus, we might attempt develop plan for severance pay for such sect forces to give temporary relief on condition that arms be turned in and that no action be taken against government. American aid might be given to settle discharged sect troops on land along lines of refugee and agrarian program. If French were able to provide funds for severance pay, we might help in resettlement. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and I agreed set up special group, operating within <gloss target="#t_TRIM1">TRIM</gloss> (special section in <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> under <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Colonel Lansdale</persName> handling pacification program) to consider this problem.<note n="4" xml:id="d59fn4">For <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName>’s account of his work on this special group and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ adverse reaction to its recommendations, see <hi rend="italic">In the Midst of Wars,</hi> pp. 248–252.</note></p>
<p>6. I remarked that Binh Xuyen appeared most dangerous group at moment. I told <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> that when President’s letter was delivered to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, Paris Embassy officer had explored with the Chief of State question of withdrawing Binh Xuyen control of police. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s action had been entirely negative. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said it was impossible <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> not support Binh Xuyen since <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> is <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s firmest supporter and still important source of Imperial revenue. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> remarked that although <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> is now heading sect coalition, he might easily be won over by the government. I asked what <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could offer him. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> wishes to be reassured rather than to obtain material benefits. I said <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> cannot reassure <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName>, who is acting against government in many fields. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that worst tactic for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to adopt would be to turn his back on <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName>. As long as contact is maintained, possibility still exists to work out some solution. <pb xml:id="pg_119" n="119" facs="0149"/>I said I would reflect on this matter but was at a loss to see what <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could offer.</p>
<p>7. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that within the government there appeared to be many men working against <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. Although they may be performing their daily functions, some of these men seem to be seeking alliance with the sects while others are turning to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. The only solution <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> had for this problem was that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should make the government work as a government and not rely, as he does, on his family. He said he would again convey this idea to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> today.</p>
<p>8. I told <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> that I was still not clear as to the status of withdrawal of U.S-financed Charbonnages equipment from the North. He said that he had given General Cogny orders to evacuate the material and would see him on this subject before <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s departure.</p>
<p>9. I told <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> that I had learned through his subordinates that he felt our political survey and re-evaluation of the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government could be postponed. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said there is no urgency about a meeting in Washington on this problem. France and U.S. are in agreement to support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. He believed a Washington meeting might be held to discuss larger questions at about the time the Haiphong enclave is evacuated. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that he had expressed this opinion to the French Government. I will take no further action but will pouch copy of our draft of survey seen by Secretary in Saigon to which <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> had given general but not formal agreement.</p>
<p>10. In reply to my question <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that during his absence his deputy for military affairs would be <persName corresp="#p_JGPE1">General Jacquot</persName>, but that no one would substitute for him in the civil sphere.</p>
<p>11. On way out I asked de Rougemont about rumors of <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s relief. He said <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> undoubtedly will be relieved but probably not till evacuation of Haiphong.</p>

<p>3812. 1. I called on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> 8th.<note n="2" xml:id="d60fn2">A memorandum of this conversation, drafted by <persName corresp="#p_SPJ1">Sturm</persName> on March 9, is in <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> Papers, Vietnam File, Series VIII, Memos for Record.</note> I asked Prime Minister what importance he attached to manifesto issued last week by sects. He replied <pb xml:id="pg_120" n="120" facs="0150"/>that only sect leaders now committed to coalition are <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai Pope</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName>; latter are supported at times by Hoa Hao leader <persName corresp="#p_LTNG1">Lam Tan Nguyen</persName> and representative of <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName>. Pope has illusions of becoming Chief of State, while Binh Xuyen and Hoa Hao are inspired by practical motives. Binh Xuyen wish retain control of police which they fear <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> intends remove from them, while <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> is seeking gain time to corner rice harvest in his own territories. Coalition would like set up triumvirate of which figurehead would be <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai Pope</persName>.</p>
<p>2. According to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, Generals <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Trinh Minh The</persName> have refused join sect coalition.<note n="3" xml:id="d60fn3">According to <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TM1">The</persName> joined the front, although they did so without realizing the significance of their decision; see <hi rend="italic">In the Midst of Wars</hi>, pp. 246–247.</note> They attended meetings in order find out what was brewing, and reported to him. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said both <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TM1">The</persName> would like replace <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai Pope</persName>, but have found no suitable replacement.</p>
<p>3. I asked <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> what sects intended do next. He replied that there is still major disagreement among leaders. However, <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> could destroy two or three important bridges. Binh Xuyen have been introducing some of their troops into police; they have acquired houses strategically located throughout metropolitan area to serve as posts, and they are continuing to recruit. Moreover, in addition to their regular armament, Binh Xuyen have three 75-mm guns and three 81-mm mortars which <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said they secured from French. To meet Binh Xuyen threat <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said he needed two squadrons of armor for which he has asked <persName corresp="#p_GGLCF1">General Gambiez</persName> to supply the matériel. (<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> will check on this.)</p>
<p>4. In addition to power in metropolitan area, Binh Xuyen have created wood and fishing monopoly along road to Cap St. Jacques, allowing no trucks other than their own to pass along highway with these products. <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Trinh Minh The</persName> now has small units along this highway and is prepared add two battalions if requested by general staff. Meanwhile, National Army has placed one small battalion back of Binh Xuyen positions on outskirts of Cholon.</p>
<p>5. In general, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> appeared not greatly concerned by sect manifesto, although he recognizes certain local and immediate dangers may threaten government.</p>
<p>6. I asked <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> his opinion of communiqué issued by Imperial Cabinet on President’s letter to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. He replied that people could read through communiqué. He said he did not believe <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> had given orders letter should be used for his own advantage, but rather that Cabinet had used it to flatter him. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has had full text of President’s letter published here. He said he did not believe communiqué threatened his position.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_121" n="121" facs="0151"/>
<p>7. With respect to military budget for February, I remarked that piaster equivalent of $108,000 was provided for <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Trinh Minh The</persName> and said this figure appeared high to me. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> replied that 3,000 <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> and 3,000 Hoa Hao forces have been incorporated into National Army under special formula whereby each unit retains own staff. I said we must be provided with military budget for whole year in order make proper plans, although disbursement will be on monthly basis. We would wish discuss military budget in detail as soon as certain studies now in progress are completed. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> agreed.</p>
<p>8. I brought up subject of police forces saying we were concerned by cost, numbers of men and armament. I said we would like to have in written form a plan for provincial police similar to plan we have for national armed forces. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said he would assign [name and titled deleted] to work on this problem with my staff. I commented that plan must be completed within next few days in order that allocation for February military expenses can be made.</p>
<p>9. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said various provincial police units now total 43,000. His plan is to reduce this figure to 30/35,000.</p>
<p>If National Army functions efficiently in pacification field, it may be possible reduce this figure still further. In addition to 43,000 mentioned, government delegate for south has received 13,000 suppletifs from French in last two months. These forces are needed for time being, but objective is to suppress them completely. With reference to armament, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said he had that day sent two representatives to center with mission of collecting rifles in hands of police units in two provinces. All but very few of these rifles will be replaced by pistols.</p>
<p>10. I told <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> I was concerned by conflicting reports on success of national security action program. Reviewing history of program, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said <persName>Minh</persName> had originally proposed a certain Cung,<note n="4" xml:id="d60fn4">Kieu Cong Cung. His activities are described <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> pp. 207–213.</note> former Vietminh major, to coordinate program. Feeling this program went beyond limits of Defense Department, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> assigned [name and title deleted] to work on problem. [Name deleted] and Cung prepared statement for recent conference of province chiefs at which Defense Minister’s plan for pacification was explained. This plan, according to Prime Minister, called for expenditure of 280 million piasters and provided for virtual duplication of all government services in provinces concerned. Province chiefs expressed dissatisfaction with plan since it would appear rob them of responsibility and authority. After conference, grandiose scheme was abandoned.<note n="5" xml:id="d60fn5">In a memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> dated March 8, Lieutenant Colonel John E. Dwan of <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ staff analyzed this plan. (<persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> Papers, Vietnam File, Series VII, <gloss target="#t_L1">L</gloss>)</note> At present time Cung, with special commission from Prime Minister, is directing pilot <pb xml:id="pg_122" n="122" facs="0152"/>project in south. [Name deleted] is not now active in pacification field. (<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> is following up on this.)</p>
<p>11. I remarked to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> we had indications things were not going well in center. There appears be conflict between government delegate and Prime Minister’s brother <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Ngo Dinh Can</persName>. President’s brothers generally are said to exercise functions outside their rightful sphere. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> defended his brothers, saying they are not active in politics. He said he had often told people of center not to importune his brother <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Can</persName> for advice. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> added that he was annoyed that people attached political importance to his family. He explained attacks on members of his family by saying that since he has no political party, those who must have an excuse for attacking him speak ill of his family. (We still feel he does use his brothers politically, with result many disadvantages, but have been unable to figure out how to stop this.)</p>

<item>Panier de Crabes, II<note n="2" xml:id="d61fn2">“A Basket of Crabs.” In an earlier memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> of this title, dated March 13, <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName> had used the phrase to characterize the South Vietnamese political situation. (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.)</note></item>
</list>
<p>1. At his request, I saw President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> yesterday from 1700 to 1850. He said he was very tired and needed to talk to someone as a friend. Here are the highlights of the conversation.</p>
<p>2. <hi rend="italic">Binh Xuyen</hi></p>
<p>The Binh Xuyen worry the President more then the other sects, because they are in position to endanger the government. He asked <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> on 9 March for tanks for the National Army, but has received no reply to date. Also, on 9 March, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> agreed to write the President a letter requesting the return of French Navy armed corvettes now in possession of the Binh Xuyen, which would permit the President to take these away from the Binh Xuyen; the <pb xml:id="pg_123" n="123" facs="0153"/>President said that the Navy turned these over to the French police who turned them over later to the Vietnamese police who gave them to the Binh Xuyen. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has not received this letter request from <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> to date.</p>
<p>President has been trying to talk to <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName>. Has written him invitations twice during recent days, telephoned him, even had a date with him for 1530 on 12 March. <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Vien</persName> did not show up. 10 minutes before my arrival yesterday, <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Vien</persName> telephoned the President to say he had twisted his ankle and thus couldn’t see the President. The President had told him that this would be a private conversation between the two of them, on a nearby plantation if <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Vien</persName> didn’t want to talk in the Palace. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said he planned to tell <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Vien</persName> he would help him in his economic ventures, if they were not illegal or harmful to the national economy (such as opium traffic). Would also discuss the integration of <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Vien</persName>’s men into the National Army.</p>
<p><persName>Robert</persName> told the President that the Sûreté under the Binh Xuyen were spending 50,000$ a month to several informant “nests”, but that information about the Vietminh was worthless. He suggested that this task be taken away from the Binh Xuyen or that another Sûreté be created.</p>
<p>3. <hi rend="italic">Other Sects</hi></p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Pope Tac</persName> is furious that Generals <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TM1">The</persName> support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. General <persName corresp="#p_TM1">The</persName> showed his true colors when he obediently moved into position to block the Binh Xuyen Saturday. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_TM1">The</persName> had been in touch with General <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName> on this move, being worried that his troop movement might be blocked by the Binh Xuyen unless the Army supplied trucks quickly.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_TM1">The</persName>, Hue, and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> were agreeable to a plan the President outlined to them: work projects for their men who are not integrated, two or three months at 300$ per man per month.</p>
<p>President has maintained firmly that <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName> is a rebel, to give the Army a firm position. In a cabinet meeting, <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> said that the Army had attacked <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName> was only defending himself. The President asked Minister <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> if this were the truth. <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> was very slow in answering that the Army was attacked by <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName>. The President said he was pretty much alone in his position in the cabinet meeting, felt lack of support by <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName>.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> usually gets prepared for action by writing complaints to the government, has done so for years. Recently, he has complained about the unfriendly actions of National Army troops. President sent these letters to Minister <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> to answer for the Army; <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> has not complied. Such complaints give <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> an excuse for action.</p>
<p>4. <hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName></hi></p>
<p>The President was disturbed by the actions of Minister <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName>, particularly in calling meetings of other cabinet ministers and telling <pb xml:id="pg_124" n="124" facs="0154"/>them that the situation was very serious. Such a meeting, right after the sect manifesto was published, was curious. The President called in <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName>, told him he was 20 years older than <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName>, and that <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> should be more rational in viewing the situation, which was like a battle front: some sectors breaking out, but other sectors having good conditions. <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> should not generalize, but should get to work on those sectors needing attention. The President offered the large meeting room in the Palace for any future meetings of ministers <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> wanted to hold, saying that if <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> were going to discuss such serious matters, the President would be interested in hearing of what would endanger the security of the nation.</p>
<p>The President is now putting his requests to <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> in writing and following them up, since <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> has not taken action on many matters, including plans for the security of Saigon–Cholon, seeing <persName corresp="#p_LTNG1">Lam Than Nguyen</persName><note n="3" xml:id="d61fn3">A Hoa Hao leader.</note> re possible integration, and many others which the President requested verbally. Also, when <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> talks about how serious the situation is, the President asks him if he has any solution and <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> admits that he hasn’t.</p>
<p>5. <hi rend="italic">Communications</hi></p>
<p>The President asked if the United States could furnish radio sets with a 20 <gloss target="#t_km1">km</gloss> radius. He wants a radio net: Presidency–Defense–General Staff–1st Military Region. The Presidential radio furnished by <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> is a small French set, which can only be used for a short time, with contact for only a few minutes at 0900 and 1700. He is worried that his radio will be nearly useless in an emergency. He would like small generators to keep the sets operable in case of city power failure.

<p>General <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName> was being fed a lot of rumors that the President was unsure of him, might replace him any day. The President called in <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName>, reassured him that he had full confidence in him, and that he would like to talk to <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName> two or three times a week, even if it were merely social visiting. <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName> replied that from the bottom of his heart he knew that he was not a superman, was loyal, and if the President desired he would leave at any time. The President feels that he has reassured <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName>.</p>
<p>7. <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_G61">G–6</gloss></hi></p>
<p>I asked the President his desires re the re-establishment of <gloss target="#t_G61">G–6</gloss>. He said that he wanted this re-established, that much of the intelligence now being reported to the General Staff was rumor and rather foolish. I informed him that officers now available to me at <gloss target="#t_TRIM1">TRIM</gloss> for advising <gloss target="#t_G61">G–6</gloss> were the same French officers who advised <gloss target="#t_G61">G–6</gloss> in <pb xml:id="pg_125" n="125" facs="0155"/>the past, and that I intended to use them for this purpose. He did not comment on this.</p>
<p>8. <hi rend="italic">U.S. Actions</hi></p>
<p>The President asked me several times if I could tell him anything new about the sects. First, I reassured him that we were aware of the situation and were studying ways and means of what the government might do. After a time, I told him that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName> had decided to invite sect military leaders in for routine briefings at <gloss target="#t_TRIM1">TRIM</gloss>,<note n="4" xml:id="d61fn4">These briefings are described in a memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_OD1">O’Daniel</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>, March 17. (<persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> Papers, Vietnam File, Series VII, O)</note> as a means of taking some of present pressures off the situation, and to help him. I did not go into details.</p>
<p>I told him that I intended to inform the Ambassador of our conversation. He said that it was embarrassing for a government head to have talked the way he did to me, if it were government to government, but that he would leave it up to my judgement.</p>
<p>9. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi></p>
<p>The President certainly was not over-confident nor optimistic when talking about the sects. He was most serious and concerned, but seemed to be thinking out the problem clearly. I believe it would be useful to show a little extra friendliness or sympathy in manner, if not in words, during the next two or three visits with him. The weight of the situation is starting to tell on him.</p>

<p>3906. 1. I called on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> 14th to discuss current troubles with sects to ask his opinion as to what we could do to be helpful. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said he had asked <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> to make declaration that sects should now follow government’s lead and that any French intervening on behalf of sects as against government would be acting contrary to French <pb xml:id="pg_126" n="126" facs="0156"/>policy. I replied that I doubted <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> could made [<hi rend="italic">make</hi>] such statement since it would be tacit admission French officers were aiding sects, which I did not believe is the case. I added that we have under study with French plan to aid troops discharged from sect forces. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> replied that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> had said he might have 5 million piasters available for this purpose. He added this is not very much considering number of troops to be accommodated. He said further that rather than attempt to work discharged sect troops into resettlement scheme, it would be desirable help them re-establish selves in own villages through payment of monthly subsidy of 300 piasters for 3 or 4 months. In addition, certain numbers of dischargees might be enrolled in labor battalions, as proposed by <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Trinh Minh The</persName> and Hoa Hao Colonel Hue.</p>
<p>2. I remarked that these are only temporary measures designed help sect leaders favorable to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, and do not solve the problem of how to deal with the sect opposition led by Generals <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> resists effort to demobilize his forces on ground that they must be prepared to meet Communist threat. <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> General <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName> says that he fears attack by <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName> and wants <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to integrate 3,000 more of his troops, making total of 6,000, in National Army. I asked <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> what approach could be made to sects to stop situation from getting worse. He said that the crux of the problem is the Binh Xuyen. Many of his advisers, including some <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName>, have told him he should remove police control from Binh Xuyen at once. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said he had hesitated to do this, waiting for the army to get into shape and take up appropriate positions. I asked <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> if he had authority to oust Binh Xuyen from police control. He replied emphatically that he did and that such a move would be the least of his prerogatives from legal viewpoint. I said I understood <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> had given police control to Binh Xuyen. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> replied that <persName corresp="#p_BLP1">Buu Loc</persName> had done so. I asked whether <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> would oppose change in police control. He said he did not think so, although if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> made abortive attempt to remove Binh Xuyen, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> would complain that he had acted clumsily. In any case he reaffirmed he had full power to dispose of police control.</p>
<p>3. I asked <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> if he was aware that certain sects had recently sent emissaries to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d62fn2">A report on these approaches to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> is in telegram 3896 from Paris, March 15. (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.)</note> <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> replied that he had heard through Vietnamese High Commissariat at Paris that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> had told emissaries he did not want Cannes to become a meeting place, especially in international eyes, of parties opposed to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government which is his (<persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s) government.</p>
<p>4. With reference to specific situation of sects, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai Pope</persName> is vexed because of his loss of influence over <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> <pb xml:id="pg_127" n="127" facs="0157"/>forces to Generals <persName corresp="#p_TM1">The</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName>. Latter, he said, has grown in stature owing to his participation in government. <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> feels his own Hoa Hao forces are falling away from him. <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName>, whose primary interest is money, has been losing in his various ventures since Grand Monde concession ended, as his enterprises were all based on gambling. While <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName> was Chief of Staff Binh Xuyen did not need fear army. Now that army is under national government control, fear of it, together with financial losses, has caused <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> join with <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai Pope</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> to oppose government.</p>
<p>I remarked that these sect leaders are still strong and ruthless and asked how they could be controlled. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said that first thing to do was to take police control from Binh Xuyen and give it to the army. He feels that <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> may be restrained from attempting action against government through fear of losing his wealth, which is considerable. I told <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> I hoped he would discuss this matter in detail with Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> before taking action. He said that he had asked <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> to study problem as long ago as January 20 with a view to disposing army troops for takeover. <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> has delayed, perhaps because he does not wish to get in trouble with Binh Xuyen. Last week <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> sent General <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName> with a plan of action which <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> found difficult to understand. I recommended that plan be personally discussed with <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName> and thereafter with few selected ministers before implementation. I asked <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> again what I could do to be of help. He replied that I could give technical assistance in studying plan for army disposition. I said that I would assign <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName> to consider plan. I asked if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> thought it would be useful if I talked to sect leaders or any emissaries of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. He replied that he thought it would not be desirable during next few days. He has invited <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> to call on him but <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> has advanced pretext of an accident to delay accepting. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said that when he saw <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> he would tell him that government would be glad to assist him in carrying out any legitimate commercial venture not harmful to the state.</p>
<p>6. I asked <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> whether General <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName>’s terms of reference as Inspector General had been signed. He replied that following Cabinet approval 12th, they were signed. Cabinet objected to provision that <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName> would be Commander in Chief in case of military operations and this provision was stricken. Decree is now being prepared for publication in official journal. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> indicated that he still has doubts about <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName> whom he considers not “safe” politically, lacking in courage and deficient in judgment.</p>
<p>7. In private conversation to which he invited <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Colonel Lansdale</persName> 13th, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> seemed pessimistic and depressed in discussing sect problem.<note n="3" xml:id="d62fn3">See the memorandum, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> <pb xml:id="pg_128" n="128" facs="0158"/>During my conversation 14th, however, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> appeared quite self-possessed and determined.</p>
<p>8. In my judgment government will soon have to take some definite steps to resolve situation created by sect action. Incidents such as yesterday morning’s attempted assassination of Tran Van Lam, the government delegate (governor) of South Vietnam, could lead to popular loss of confidence in government’s ability to maintain law and order. We will continue to advise <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to seek political solution, but this will be difficult without bowing to continuations sects’ special privileges which run counter <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government’s programs. Meanwhile, I have directed <persName corresp="#p_OD1">O’Daniel</persName> quietly review National Army plans for action in event <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> decides to take over police powers with army troops.</p>

<p>3980. For the Secretary.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_131" n="131" facs="0161"/>
<p>1. As you know, I have been studying for some time question of elections in Vietnam under Geneva Accords. Some time ago, I designated members of my mission to work up a study of this subject in conjunction with Embassy political section. This study is being forwarded by despatch<note n="2" xml:id="d65fn2">Despatch 297 from Saigon, March 19, not printed. (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.)</note> in order that our thoughts may be made promptly available to group in Department which, I understand, is likewise working on problem.<note n="3" xml:id="d65fn3">Apparently the reference is to a draft of an <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper, “U.S. Policy on all-Vietnam Elections”, March 4, which was being prepared in <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss> by <persName corresp="#p_SCC1">Stelle</persName>, (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> <gloss target="#t_PPS1">PPS</gloss> Files: Lot 66 D 70, <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss> Record Copies, Jan.–May 1955) This draft was submitted in March to other members of the Department for their comments. (Memorandum from Fried to <persName corresp="#p_SCC1">Stelle</persName>, March 10; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Files: Lot 62 D 1, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5519)</note></p>
<p>2. I would like to outline in this message my personal judgments as to procedure we should recommend to Vietnam Government and broad outline of policies which we should advise them to follow.</p>
<p>3. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government should seize initiative from Viet Minh and announce very shortly that they are in full support of genuinely free elections designed to unite all of Vietnam. They should express full confidence that if truly free elections are held Communist regime of <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> will be defeated. They should express willingness to participate in preliminary discussions commencing in July, which would lead to the conduct of elections in July of 1956. For the moment, however, Vietnamese Government should scrupulously avoid committing itself to any specific details arrangements.</p>
<p>4. Form and status of Government of South Vietnam as it is likely to develop between now and July 1956 must be considered in connection with question of elections under Geneva Accord. It would be advantageous if before July 1956 a fully elected assembly, and a government responsible to it, could be in operation in South Vietnam. Practical considerations, however, will probably rule out any such development, even though <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government has indicated its intention to proceed along that line.</p>
<p>5. Decree has been adopted by government providing for provisional assembly, partly indirectly elected and partly appointed. It is proposed that life of this assembly be limited and that it be succeeded by elected constituent assembly. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had said he does not believe he can resist pressures to form constituent assembly for longer than about six months after provisional assembly is formed, chiefly because sects want to take full advantage of their present strength and not allow government time to weaken them seriously before relative representation in assembly has been determined.</p>
<p>6. It appears that provisional assembly will not be set up and functioning before June 1955. If this assembly has only six months of <pb xml:id="pg_132" n="132" facs="0162"/>life, plans for constituent assembly would have to be completed and an election held during last half of 1955, when Vietnamese will presumably be negotiating with Viet Minh on elections to be held under Geneva Accord in July 1956. Once constituent assembly has been formed, it would have to draft constitution dealing, among other matters, with thorny question of “permanent” form of government and “permanent” role of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. Leaving aside question of whether constitution, once completed, should be submitted to people for ratification, constituent assembly, under normal procedures, would have to be succeeded by an elected legislative assembly, from which government would be formed. Since provisional assembly will apparently have been in process of formation for not less than six months, and that without holding a general election, it seems unrealistic to suppose that South Vietnam could create both a constituent and a legislative assembly, involving two general elections, draft a constitution and set up a government in its permanent form in time remaining before July 1956. Moreover, an attempt to crowd all these undertakings into next fifteen months, given inexperience and present lack of cohesiveness of south, would probably create more confusion and arouse more partisan differences and bitterness than South Vietnam can afford at a time when its best energies should be available to meet threat offered by negotiation with Viet Minh.</p>
<p>7. An additional point of substance in this connection is that if Vietnamese Government were engaged in formulation “permanent” political institutions while at same time it was negotiating with Viet Minh ostensibly to reunite the country, it might lay itself open to charges of duplicity which might carry weight with the powers represented at Geneva, particularly France and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.</p>
<p>8. Accordingly, I believe we should advise Vietnamese not to attempt basic revision of their governmental institutions before July 1956. This might mean that formation of constituent assembly would have to be postponed until after date scheduled for elections under Geneva Accord. On the other hand, we should encourage Vietnamese in every way to strengthen government in its present form and to make provisional assembly as representative and effective as circumstances permit.</p>
<p>9. In discussions commencing this July, Vietnamese Government should propose and adhere to a formula approximately as follows: since North and South Vietnam will each have its own government in operation in July of 1956, elections at that time should have two objectives: to permit people express their will with respect to unification and to select delegates for convention which would determine form and conditions of union. North and South Vietnam must have equal representation in this convention. Conclusions of convention should be approved by two-thirds majority.</p>

<p>10. Consideration should also be given to introducing requirement that final act of convention would have to be approved separately by existing governments of North and South Vietnam. There are certain disadvantages to this latter proposal. It might be interpreted by the free world as a definite attempt on part of South Vietnam to block any union, or it might be accepted by Communists as a weapon in their hands to prevent union in the unlikely event convention should recommend a unified non-Communist government. An advantage of this proposal is that it would probably be completely unacceptable to Viet Minh and thus could serve as a definite “stopper” to any final action should [that?] prove necessary.</p>
<p>11. During convention, South Vietnamese could debate a whole series of issues pending development of situation which might lead to establishment of unified non-Communist government for all Vietnam. If latter should not be feasible discussions could continue until convention reached a state of inertia. Meanwhile, separate governments of North and South Vietnam would remain in operation.</p>
<p>12. In preparation for discussion to commence this July, US should firm up its position along lines of above formula, or some other specific proposal. We should strengthen present US Embassy staff in Saigon with one or two technical experts who have had experience in such matters, and who can be available to advise Vietnam Government.</p>
<p>13. In addition, I feel it would be well to secure services of some non-American technical expert, who might be hired by Vietnamese Government to work actively and openly with Vietnamese Delegation. This person preferably should be a national of one of the countries not signatory to Geneva Accord or Manila Pact.</p>
<p>14. Above ideas are sketched in broad outline only. Study forwarded by enclosure to Embassy despatch 297, March 17, discusses various aspects of this problem in more detail and may be useful supplement to excellent intelligence report number 6818 prepared by <gloss target="#t_DRF1">DRF</gloss>.<note n="4" xml:id="d65fn4">Not printed.

<p>4061. Secretary discussed question of elections in Vietnam with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> at Ottawa on March 18.<note n="2" xml:id="d66fn2"><persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> was in Ottawa March 17–18 for talks with Canadian officials. (Princeton University Library, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> Papers, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> Appointment Book)</note> <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> said several months ago Canadians believed if free elections were held Vietminh would win sweeping victory. Now their officials in Vietnam say that because of disillusionment in north over communist regime and difficult economic conditions, genuinely free elections six months to one year hence might well be won Vietnamese Government.</p>
<p>Secretary agreed with above estimate. He said that in his recent Saigon visit he had urged <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to accept principle of holding elections and concentrate on procedures necessary to insure genuinely free elections and on what elections would be for (Chief of State, constituent assembly, provincial assemblies, one of the two regimes, or what). Secretary said he believed <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was disposed to begin discussions with Vietminh next July. He did not believe communists would agree to free elections particularly in the light of the evolution of events in the north. Therefore elections might never be held, but it was important that the reason be a communist refusal to permit free elections. <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> said he fully agreed. He thought it important that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government be willing to discuss elections with Vietminh, but he was not sure they would ever be held. Final result could well be a divided Vietnam similar to divided Korea and Germany.</p>
<p>He commented that role of International Commission in any such elections was far from clear. Adequate supervision would require a very large personnel which Canada could not supply but which he felt India might. He also made clear that Canada would like nothing better than to be able to shed responsibilities it had assumed with respect to Indochina because there seemed no end in sight and it imposed a heavy drain on their manpower resources. The Secretary said he felt it essential for Canada to continue playing its role on the Commission. He mentioned that “free” elections would require insurance against prior coercion and subsequent reprisal and <pb xml:id="pg_135" n="135" facs="0165"/>not merely freedom for a moment. In this connection Secretary cited <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> position re Germany at Berlin Conference.<note n="3" xml:id="d66fn3">Apparent reference to the Berlin Conference of Foreign Ministers, January 25–February 18, 1954.</note></p>

<p>4019. This is joint Embassy–<gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>/F message. Reference: <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 4049 to Saigon, repeated 3270 to Paris, March 18.<note n="2" xml:id="d67fn2">In this telegram the Department asked for information on the French Government’s intentions on its budget for the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/3–1055)</note></p>
<p>1. Re second paragraph reference telegram, we reported in <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 3926, March 16, repeated Saigon 569,<note n="3" xml:id="d67fn3">Not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.5–MSP/3–1655)</note> that we had heard nothing further from French as of that time re <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 aid for <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>. One factor making for delay has been Delouvrier’s departure from post Secretary General Interministerial Committee to join staff Coal-Steel Community. In discussion with Embassy officers on March 19, <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> (Foreign Office) referred to question <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 aid to <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> but he added no details as to present French thinking this matter.</p>
<p>2. We will be interested in Saigon’s comments re size <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> force level that could be financed by a 60 billion franc ($170 million) French budgetary contribution and 35 billion francs ($100 million) of US aid.<note n="4" xml:id="d67fn4">In telegram 4046 from Saigon, March 23, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> reported that <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Vietnam estimated that $270 million would be sufficient to maintain 75,000 troops of the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> in Vietnam. Furthermore, he did not recommend increasing the U.S. offer of aid above $100 million as the French would not repatriate troops fast enough to reduce the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> much below the 75,000 level by the end of 1955. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.5–MSP/3–2355)</note> Washington will recall that last December (<gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 2582, repeated Saigon 380, December 17, 1954<note n="5" xml:id="d67fn5">Printed in <ref target="frus1952-54v13p2"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, vol. XIII, Part 2</ref>, p. 2387.</note>) French were using figures showing that minimum cost during <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1955 of a force level falling progressively throughout the year to an estimated 20,000–30,000 men by end 1955 was in neighborhood 130 billion francs, i.e., leaving a gap of 35 billion francs (130 minus 95). Would appear that maintenance force level of 75,000 men throughout year would cost at least <pb xml:id="pg_136" n="136" facs="0166"/>as much as 130 billion francs, making original French cost estimate reasonably accurate.</p>
<p>3. From tactical point of view we do not believe it would be advisable for US to take initiative at this time to “confirm” $100 million offer of aid for <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> for <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1955. Any approach now by US should, we feel, be limited to warning to French, as suggested in <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 3926, repeated Saigon 569, March 16, that in view restrictions imposed by Section 108 Appropriations Act 1955 and short time remaining before end fiscal year $100 million offer cannot be held open beyond some designated date—e.g., April 30, 1955, and that if agreement is to be reached on granting such aid, it is absolutely essential that French present their plans for <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1955 as a whole to US in sufficient time before deadline to permit consideration on US side and negotiation of formal agreement. Re <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName>’s suggestion (<gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 3997<note n="6" xml:id="d67fn6">Dated March 19, not printed. (Department of State, Central Files, 396.1–WA/3–1955)</note>) that <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 aid be added to agenda proposed Indochina talks if matter not settled by that time, if US agrees to this suggestion we do not believe French should be allowed to interpret our assent as meaning we willing see question remain in suspense until latter part April.</p>
<p>4. Question of relationship between our finally agreeing to <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 aid program for <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> and level of forces which French decide maintain in Indochina during current year is extremely delicate one. Even though considerable time has elapsed since last Franco-US discussion of plans for <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955, situation is, if anything, more confused than ever. On the one hand, in informal conversations with us, French officials have continued to maintain that if US aid not increased above $100 million, lack of adequate financial resources will make necessary sizable reduction <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> below 75,000 level during second half-year. Worsening of 1955 budget situation in other areas does not augur well for possible increases in <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> appropriations. On the other hand, there are some indications (see Embassy despatch 1969, March 17, and <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 4003, repeated Saigon 582, March 21<note n="7" xml:id="d67fn7">Neither printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 851.10/3–1755 and 751G.00/3–2155, respectively)</note>) of pressures on French Government to raise its own financial contribution in order support force recommended by French military opinion as necessary to protect French interests, lives and property in Indochina. We note and concur in Washington position that $100 million offer should not be raised. Question from our point of view is therefore whether conditioning our $100 million aid offer on maintenance given force level would lead French to decide upon higher force level if they were not otherwise prepared to do so. We do not believe that it would. At same time, such conditioning might <pb xml:id="pg_137" n="137" facs="0167"/>have adverse political and psychological consequences. Thus we would think it undesirable both in France and in Indochina, to have it known (and the news would undoubtedly leak) that US was exerting financial pressure on France to maintain a specified <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> troop strength. We feel that to attach to our aid offer a condition re troop strength would present French with irresistible invitation in turn to apply pressure to US for increase in offer and to put blame on us if increase fails materialize, French refuse to close gap, and force level has to be lowered.</p>
<p>5. To summarize:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) In present circumstances there appears to us to be almost no possibility that $100 million aid offer could be used to insure that French maintain a 75,000-man <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>. Aid amount, large as it is in absolute terms, is small in terms French budgetary needs.</item>
<item>(b) On contrary, there is real possibility that even with $100 million in US aid French Government will plead it unable finance cost of a 75,000-man <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>.</item>
<item>(c) Washington should bear in mind, however, French will undoubtedly have to finance some additional costs themselves above 95 billion francs (assuming that US aid does not amount to more than $100 million), even if <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> force level is brought down to 20,000–30,000 men by end <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1955.</item>
</list>
<p>Therefore, at this juncture we inclined believe best posture for US to maintain $100 million offer along lines described paragraph 3 above, i.e., attempt have French disclose to us soonest what they intend do re force level. Situation can then be reviewed in light their intentions.</p>

<p>4012. 1. I called on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> 18th, principally to discuss sect problem. I told him that I hoped problem would be solved politically rather than by use of force and advised him of progress of US-French plan to provide discharged sect forces with severance pay on surrender of their arms and some aid toward reestablishing selves in <pb xml:id="pg_138" n="138" facs="0168"/>civil life.<note n="2" xml:id="d68fn2">See <ref target="#d62">Document 62</ref>.</note> <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> expressed interest in this plan but said he thought it was more theoretical than practical since he does not believe arms, or at least all arms, will be turned in. He said that if he had fifteen million piastres per month for three or four months available as secret fund for political use among sects, he could buy off enough sectarian dissidents to cripple sects militarily. I asked how he could be sure of buying permanent loyalty in this manner. He replied he was sure there were enough sectarian troops dissatisfied with their lot and their leaders and anxious to be relieved of their feudal bonds to insure the success of his plan. I agreed to discuss this manner with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> further. (There is a certain validity to this approach. Will explore with others before taking action.)</p>
<p>2. I asked <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> how he might renew contact with <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> to determine what practicable terms of settlement might be acceptable to Binh Xuyen leader. I said I understood Minister for Plan <persName corresp="#p_NVT2">Thoai</persName> might be suitable intermediary. (<gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> had made this suggestion to me although I did not tell <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.) <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> replied that <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> reacted unfavorably to Ministers, but that he did intend attempt renew contact in coming week through an old friend of <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> whom he did not name. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> went on to say that <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> is ailing, very rich and disinclined to continue struggle for power, but is egged on by his political adviser Tai and police chief <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName>, both of whom are enriching selves under his protection. Moreover, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said, <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> has had bad news from Cannes that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> does not intend support sects, a fact which may further encourage him to relax his efforts against govt.</p>
<p>3. I asked <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> if he believed that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> was really serious in his rejection of sect overtures. He said he felt sure sects believed <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> was sincere. Sixteenth Binh Xuyen had meeting on subject at which they decided undertake campaign of vilification against <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> since he had declined support them.</p>
<p>4. I inquired of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> what plans he had to neutralize Binh Xuyen and insure security of Saigon in event he decided withdraw control of police from Binh Xuyen. He said that to take over police with safety he would need have three or four battalions of National Army encamped within city. That force would be sufficient to deal with sporadic local outbreaks and insure general security. However National Army does not have installations sufficient to house so many troops. He has asked <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> to turn over certain barrack areas for this purpose, but no agreement has been reached. I informed <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> I had asked <persName corresp="#p_OD1">O’Daniel</persName> to organize a National Army tank company which could be stationed in city for some time and later incorporated <pb xml:id="pg_139" n="139" facs="0169"/>in one of the combat divisions. (In this connection see report of my conversation with <persName corresp="#p_GGLCF1">General Gambiez</persName>, <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 4011.<note n="3" xml:id="d68fn3">Dated March 21, not printed. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/3–2155)</note>)</p>
<p>5. I told <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> I hoped to meet with him and Ministers of Defense and Finance during coming week to complete military and civil budget estimates for present year. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> agreed, saying budget for Center Vietnam is completed while that for South Vietnam should be finished in few days. He remarked that this would be first Vietnamese budget since war and first ever drawn up by Vietnamese.</p>
<p>6. Referring to my recent trip to Cambodia,<note n="4" xml:id="d68fn4">According to telegram 3866 from Saigon, March 13, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> was to visit Cambodia March 15–16. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 120.1551G/3–1355)</note> I said I was surprised to note that Associated States have not exchanged diplomatic representatives, since to do so rather than continue association through French would be clear demonstration of their independence. He replied that <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> has contacted Laotians and Cambodians to that end, but that neither appear to be in any hurry. I said I would raise question in Laos in coming week. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said he had always had good relations with <persName corresp="#p_SN1">Norodom Sihanouk</persName> and that it was his policy to be friendly with Cambodians to keep them from turning away from port of Saigon.</p>
<p>7. Changing subject with some abruptness, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said that since turn over of territorial command of South Vietnam had been completed Feb 20 great progress had been made in establishing National Army control. <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> is now reduced to certain “islands of villages” and has been so weakened that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> let him know indirectly that he could leave the govt whenever he wished. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> believes <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> has no intention of resigning, however, and that he is led on to cause trouble by the Binh Xuyen. Meanwhile the Hoa Hao Ministers of Agriculture and National Economy are tending to break away from <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName>’s influence.</p>
<p>8. I said that current situation points up how much of governmental load <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is bearing. He replied that he was thinking of naming a Vice <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> but was hesitating between two men: [name and title deleted] and <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName>. Latter however is deficient in work capacity. I asked if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had no intention of appointing anyone from outside present govt. He replied that he did not so intend for the moment. He would like to name Ambassador to Japan <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> as Vice <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> but that would mean open war with the Hoa Hao. I reminded <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that when we had talked of <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>’s entering the govt he had alleged that would cause troubles with the sects, but I wondered if we would have had any more trouble with sects than he now has. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> made no reply. I asked <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> if he would consider <pb xml:id="pg_140" n="140" facs="0170"/>turning over Interior Ministry to new Vice <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>. He replied that Interior is chiefly concerned with police and Sûreté and as long as Binh Xuyen control those services there would be no advantage in assigning Interior to Vice <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>.</p>
<p>9. Referring further to his Cabinet, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said that the financial-economic group is functioning well and as a team. Other Cabinet groups however are dominated by the sects, and <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> is obliged to step in repeatedly to rectify errors they have committed.</p>

<p>4042. Re <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 4038 rptd Paris 1070.<note n="2" xml:id="d69fn2">In this telegram, March 22, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> summarized the text of the sects’ declaration and resolution issued March 21, which constituted an ultimatum to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to replace his cabinet with one approved by the United Front of the sects. (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.)</note> Significant and disquieting feature of sect declaration and motion (resolution) of March 21 is open association with united front of Generals <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Trinh Minh The</persName> who have now signed both documents. For first time united front has managed to gain public adherence almost all significant elements sect groups. Only omissions of note are names of Hoa Hao dissidents General Nguyen Giac Ngo and Hoa Hao Colonel Hue.</p>
<p>Second significant feature of sect declaration is that time limit of five days is fixed for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to accede to sect demands and to set up new government which must meet approval of sects.</p>
<p>In conversations with <persName corresp="#p_GGLCF1">Gambiez</persName>, De Rougement, and <persName corresp="#p_WM1">Wintrebert</persName> (Acting French High Commissioner to Vietnam) we have made following preliminary observations: Key to situation is Binh Xuyen leader <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName>, who is most intelligent, ruthless and aggressive of leaders. Although Binh Xuyen sect does not have large population base, it has certain armed forces strategically located in and about Saigon–Cholon and retains control police and security forces. <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName>’s steadfast desire to obtain control of Interior Ministry, and with it internal administrative machinery of country, has long been known. His views in present development have not yet been clearly determined but it is believed that his price remains approximately the same.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_141" n="141" facs="0171"/>
<p>We believe that sects will for the time continue confine their activities to political sphere, but it is possible they have in mind attempting apply economic pressure to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government after expiration 5-day period by attempting impede movement food supplies from and through sect-held areas to Saigon. <persName corresp="#p_GGLCF1">Gambiez</persName> has told me that should sects attempt institute economic blockade French, who still retain responsibility ultimate security Saigon–Cholon, will take action to prevent this. I suggested that he make this clear to both <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and to sects and he agreed to do so. This should be element of comfort to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and should weigh heavily as deterring factor to such action by sects.</p>
<p>There is general belief that sects, having gone so far as to make demands on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in form of classic “ultimatum”, will feel obliged take some actions within city itself. This would most likely be fomenting civil demonstrations against <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s brother <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Luyen</persName> has told <persName corresp="#p_WM1">Wintrebert</persName> that in such event <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would attempt break up demonstrations, using two parachute battalions and one armored squadron at his disposal. Oriental psychology is such that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> cannot allow demonstrations be “successful”, meaning unopposed, and therefore must take action stop them.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s first reaction to sect demands, according <persName corresp="#p_WM1">Wintrebert</persName> who saw him evening 21st, was one of discouragement and depression. <persName corresp="#p_WM1">Wintrebert</persName> says <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was particularly struck by defection <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Trinh Minh The</persName> upon whom Prime Minister appears to have been counting heavily (and to whom he has been liberally providing funds). <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_WM1">Wintrebert</persName>, as he had on previous occasion, that <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Trinh Minh The</persName> was going along with sects only “to keep an eye on them”, but <persName corresp="#p_WM1">Wintrebert</persName> says this time <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> himself seemed unconvinced by his own explanation.</p>
<p>In summary: (a) Adherence of <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Trinh Minh The</persName> to “United Front” greatly weakens <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s position and adds strength to that of sects. (b) Sects will likely continue pressure on political plane for next few days but incidents may be expected in sect areas as well as possible attempts at civil demonstrations within Saigon. (c) Possible attempt at economic blockade Saigon should be deterred by knowledge French will take action against such program. (d) While they will go to great lengths to avoid situation involving bloodshed or in which they will find themselves having take action against Vietnamese, French acknowledge ultimate responsibility preservation order within Saigon–Cholon. (e) <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> cannot bow to demands of sects and accept their terms. Any government based on temporary and tenuous grouping of sects could scarcely be expected long endure, nor would it merit US support and confidence. (f) <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s <pb xml:id="pg_142" n="142" facs="0172"/>only immediate course of action would appear to be to decline demands of sects but enter negotiations.</p>

<p>4074. 1. To make sure sect leaders had no doubts as to U.S. support of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and to try to ascertain specific sect demands, I invited <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> Generals <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Trinh Minh The</persName> to call on me evening 22. <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName> opened conversation with statement to effect <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had made definite promises with respect to supporting <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> troops, which he failed to keep. Specifically, he said, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had promised him 6 million piastres monthly, 5 million from defense funds and 1 million from secret funds. He said he still wanted <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to remain as Prime Minister but that he was desperately trying to find means of supporting his troops. I replied to this that the U.S. would support integration of certain <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> troops into National Army unless these forces were used against government. I asked what sect leaders really wished, since their desires were not clear from the manifesto. <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName> replied that Hoa Hao and Binh Xuyen wished maintain insecurity in country, so that they might continue to profit therefrom. I asked why, if this was case, <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TM1">The</persName> joined them in signing manifesto. <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName> replied he thought himself abandoned by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and U.S. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, he added, is trying to form and develop political party to destroy other parties and the sects. The Hoa Hao and Binh Xuyen are supported by “others”, not named, while <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> troops are ill fed and equipped. I commented that <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName> has been financially aided by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and that U.S. will continue to give certain aid through established Vietnamese channels to integrated forces which support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and that <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> will profit therefrom. Changing his tack somewhat, <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName> said that he had signed manifesto because of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s political blunders. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, he alleged, pits religion (Catholic) against religion; sect vs sect. People from Center Viet Nam have come to <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName> to complain of the activities of <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Ngo Dinh Can</persName>’s party of national revolution, “Catholic party designed to establish a family dictatorship.” I replied that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had guaranteed religious <pb xml:id="pg_143" n="143" facs="0173"/>liberty and that U.S. would support no other policy. Obviously no Catholic troops were in position to attack the <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> and assured him U.S. would never support a Catholic army. <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName> added he wants national unity and is grateful for U.S. aid to that end. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, he said, is not acting in interests of unity and he signed manifesto to warn <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to abandon his policy.</p>
<p>2. Turning to General <persName corresp="#p_TM1">The</persName>, I said that he had rallied to the government “unconditionally”, had been handsomely paid, and was now in the National Army. I mentioned that all this money came from U.S. sources, and asked if he expected U.S. to pay his forces if government were overthrown. <persName corresp="#p_TM1">The</persName> replied one might be surprised to see his signature on manifesto but it was a strategem to gain admittance to meeting of sects’ leaders. His purpose in attending meetings is to keep leaders from adopting extreme measures. He said some leaders wanted to eliminate <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> entirely but he had succeeded in softening manifesto to permit <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> remain in office.</p>
<p>3. To both <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TM1">The</persName> I said that our objective was to help the country, including sects, and we were studying a solution to sect problem with French and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. I pointed out that if the sects acted against the government there would be no solution and in any event, none was possible in five days. I suggested that if <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TM1">The</persName> wished to help Viet Nam they should advise their fellow sect leaders not to take any action in five days. I added that if they should succeed in overthrowing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, U.S. might very well withdraw and reminded them they could expect no aid from <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName>.</p>
<p>4. This conversation left me with a sense of unreality which marks so many situations here. Discussing this problem with these generals was like trying to reason with two stubborn four year old children. They were either lying very ineptly or they are alarmingly stupid considering the influence and power they wield. In most instances their accusations were without foundation and their arguments without logic. Trying to determine from them exactly what they wanted was completely futile. I am convinced that their evasive answers to my questions were clumsy attempts to cover selfish motives of sect leaders. Only advantage in this conversation was that it quite clearly indicated that sects don’t trust each other and possibly will not hang together very long.</p>

<p>4074. Regarding sect problem in Viet Nam, I had several conversations today with French officials, including private meetings with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LFH1">La Forest</persName>, Minister for Associated States. French (1) urge joint Franco-United States approach to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> to play for time and mediate modus vivendi; (2) desire quick formation national union government broadly representative various groups, perhaps as pushed by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>; and (3) want to avoid at any cost <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>-sect affair turning into armed conflict. French officials say they are convinced <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> cannot alone settle sect problem and needs assist from <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and other elements in Viet Nam. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> told me he fully shares these views.</p>
<p>He concurred in summary <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> telegram to Department 4042, repeated information Paris 1073.<note n="2" xml:id="d71fn2"><ref target="#d69">Document 69</ref>.</note> I told him <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> last Thursday<note n="3" xml:id="d71fn3">March 17.</note> had underlined his belief <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> cannot afford give in to sect terms or threats since authority of government in Viet Nam at stake, and that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> must exert positive influence not just passive attitude. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> planning arrive Saigon Sunday.<note n="4" xml:id="d71fn4">March 27.</note> Embassy officers and I emphasize any joint intervention Viet Nam should be done by Generals <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>.</p>
<p>I have impression French may tend underrate capabilities <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and other anti-sect elements, overplay role <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, and treat <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and sect leaders as two parties on same plane in dispute. These factors need careful consideration if we and French are to move effectively in this affair. To counteract these views I stressed necessity uphold <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s authority. <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> showed us telegram from <persName corresp="#p_DJH1">Daridan</persName> reporting joint discussion with <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> which gave joint evaluation <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> no longer can count on support from National Army, to the same extent.</p>

<head>72. Memorandum of a Conversation Between the Special Representative in Vietnam (<persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>) and Bishop Ngo Dinh Thuc, Saigon, <date when="1955-03-25">March 25, 1955</date><note n="1" xml:id="d72fn1" type="source">Source: <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> Papers, Vietnam File, Series VII, T. Secret. Drafted by <persName corresp="#p_SPJ1">Sturm</persName> on March 26.</note></head>
<p>1. Ngo Dinh Thuc, Bishop of Vinh-Long and brother of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, called on Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> at the latter’s invitation the evening of March 25. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> told Mgr. Thuc that he wished to talk to him confidentially, not as a Bishop but as the brother of the Prime Minister; he added that he himself was speaking as a friend of Vietnam and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>
<p>2. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> told the Bishop that he wished to discuss with him problems relating to two of the Prime Minister’s brothers, <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Can</persName>. He said that the Prime Minister was widely criticized for relying on his family in political matters rather than on his Cabinet and members of his administration. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>, in particular since he is always near the Prime Minister, is held responsible for actions <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> takes, or fails to take. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> said he believed it would be advantageous to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and to the country if <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> were to be sent abroad on a mission, perhaps as Ambassador.</p>
<p>3. Bishop Thuc said he was aware of this criticism. He added that when <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> returned to Vietnam in 1954 he had relied heavily on <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> for the formation of his first Cabinet, since he knew hardly anyone. However, after the first month or two <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> ceased to rely on <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> and now neither consults him nor listens to his advice. In fact, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has on several occasions reproached <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> for having introduced to him men who turned out to be worthless. For example, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has recently chided <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> for having persuaded him that <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Trinh Minh The</persName>, with whom <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> has been very friendly, was worthy of trust.</p>
<p>4. Thuc went on to say that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> urged <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> last fall to attend a UNESCO meeting at Montevideo, since he was run down and the change would have been good for him, but <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> refused, saying he could not leave as long as <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was under attack. By staying, however, <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> has drawn on himself all the criticism which <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s enemies did not quite dare vent on the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>5. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> said that if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> does not in fact rely on <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>, that is an even stronger reason for his leaving, since by his presence he is harming the Prime Minister in the eyes of the public. He went on to say that in Center Vietnam <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Ngo Dinh Can</persName> is popularly believed to be more powerful than the Government Delegate Duyen. <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Can</persName> is also accused of organizing a Catholic party and Army. While Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> does not believe these charges, he does <pb xml:id="pg_146" n="146" facs="0176"/>think that <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Can</persName>’s presence and activities in the Center lay him open to criticism which redounds adversely on the Prime Minister. He added that it would be a good thing if <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Can</persName> were sent to the U.S. for a few months to be treated for the heart condition from which he is said to suffer. We could arrange such a trip easily. Bishop Thuc replied that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s warmest supporters in the Center are non-Catholics. However, it is true that <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Can</persName> organized the Center for his brother’s return in 1954, and it is also true that he has a political party.</p>
<p>6. As a final remark to Bishop Thuc, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> said that he hoped no further Catholic dignitaries would visit Vietnam for at least six months. Also, the religious banners hung about the streets near the Palace lend credence to the criticism that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is basing his policy on the Catholic Church. Thuc said that Cardinal Gilroy’s visit had been proposed by R.G. Casey,<note n="2" xml:id="d72fn2">Richard Gardiner Casey, Australian Foreign Minister.</note> and that the banners had been produced by the seminarists of [name deleted], and not requested by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>
<p>7. Bishop Thuc said he would see <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> on his return from Hue March 27 or 28 and would discuss these matters with him.</p>

<pb xml:id="pg_147" n="147" facs="0177"/>
<p>Tenor of démarche implied an equality of status between government and sects. Fact is sects are rebels motivated by selfish considerations acting against legal government.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Highlights of Conversation, President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, 26 March</item>
</list>
<p>1. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> asked me to see him last night. Did so, accompanied by Lt. Redick as interpreter. Noted that the Palace was on alert security, with additional troops patrolling the Palace grounds and inside the gates. The President himself looked sleepy (he said he had not slept the night before), but he was cheerful. He joked about reports that the Binh Xuyen had mortars trained on the Palace and we might be shelled at any moment.</p>
<p>2. He opened the conversation by relating at length the events of his 25 March meeting with <persName corresp="#p_LTNG1">Lam Thanh Nguyen</persName> and representatives of other sect leaders. He noted that they had a program about 3-pages long, which they waved in the air but did not show him, stating that he would have to accept the principle of changing his government first before they would reveal what their program was. He said that he told them that the “principle” was as old as man, that a leader could dismiss anyone for dishonesty or incompetency. He told them finally that he would see the principal leaders who had signed the manifesto, not their representatives, since the principals were the ones who had noted that the situation was “grave”. They asked what they could tell the press. The President finally told them that they could say that he accepted the principle of having further interviews with the sect Front.</p>

The President said that troop morale was high among troops in the city, that officers were telling him that now was the time to go <pb xml:id="pg_149" n="149" facs="0179"/>after the Binh Xuyen, that people would be happy at this action. At 1215 on 26 March, he sent a directive to Chief of Police <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> and Delegate to the South Lam placing all present police personnel directly under the Prefecture. He said he would soon order the dissolution of Binh Xuyen shock troops, and in three or four days replace <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> with another Chief of Police.</p>
<p>4. I told the President that this plan was not well thought out, politically, since he was not that certain yet of the Hoa Hao and the <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName>. I told him that he should place himself as the leader of the people of the nation, with the people backing him, prior to any such moves. I suggested that he do this by announcing that his police move had been made because the seat of government, Saigon–Cholon, was a trust for all the people of the nation, and that its safety should not be in the hands of any one individual or small organization, but in the hands of the legal government.</p>
<p>5. Also, I pointed out that the sect manifesto deadline had passed. In effect, the President had won although the sects were threatening to create disorder the coming week. His wisest move would be to announce a meeting of all sect leaders with them [<hi rend="italic">him</hi>?] in either a week or ten days, telling the people that the sects had not given him a program and that he was preparing a program to present to the sects and all the people, concerning the national welfare (including sect folks) which he would have ready by the sect meeting.</p>
<p>6. The President asked me what his program should be. So, I asked him what his program was. He spoke of demobilization, pay for troops, settling on the land, the problems of inflation, and then asked for ideas. I said that I would like to take this up with the Ambassador and some other folks, was sure that all of us could come up with some good advice, if he really wanted it. He said he did. (I was thinking of the Sect Study to be presented to him, which should answer this.)</p>
<p>7. The President mentioned that <persName corresp="#p_JGPE1">General Jacquot</persName> had assured him that he would provide sufficient French troops for the protection of the city in case of necessity.</p>
<p>8. The President mentioned <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Ho Thong Minh</persName>. I told him that <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> was feeling badly about the President’s apparent lack of trust in him, that <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> was a <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> man who might be a bit brash at times, but was the sort of younger and energetic person the President should make use of, and that the President should call in <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName>, tell him to cheer up, that the President was counting on him. The President agreed, said he would do this.</p>

<p>4197. For <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>. Further to <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName>’s comments in Paris 4074 of Department repeated Saigon 595.<note n="2" xml:id="d76fn2"><ref target="#d71">Document 71</ref>.</note> <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName>’s conversations March 23 and 24 with French officials including Prime Minister further confirm impressions contained final paragraph <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>. French overestimate sect capabilities and tend believe sect leaders have relatively more power than at <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s disposal. As of last week French inclined doubt solidity national army behind <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> or ability national army battalions move effectively against Binh Xuyen or sect military groups. French officials left <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> with impression they are not trying to maneuver <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> out of office but are willing now to support his government in principle. They do intensely wish to see it strengthened with effective appointments. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> mentioned <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> in particular.</p>
<p>However, last week French officials put <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and sect leaders on same plane because of French evaluation of relative power positions. For this reason they also all agreed resort to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> was essential to settle dispute and prevent armed conflict at all costs. Top French officials and also French senators interested in Indochina with whom <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> talked at <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName>’s lunch Thursday<note n="3" xml:id="d76fn3">March 24; for a report of part of the conversation, see telegram 4116, <ref target="#d74">Document 74</ref>.</note> all suggested some sort of “presidium” or national council including sects as device to compromise sect–<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> feud and also increse representative character of government of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>
<p>In several conversations with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> present as well as with him alone <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> tried his best to emphasize</p>
<list>
<item>1) Absolute necessity of upholding authority central government and Prime Minister.</item>
<item>2) Sect leaders are in fact rebels and should not be treated or given assistance on a par with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. (French admitted this in principle but insisted realities of sect military power gave them whip hand over <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.)</item>
<item>3) Personally felt time for joint or individual French-US démarche to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> very premature.</item>
<item>4) Pointed out <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had many cards to play and probably had more support in Viet-Nam in general as well as against unpopular sect leaders than French seemed willing to concede.</item>
<item>5) Concurred necessity bringing more representative as well as competent nationalist figures into cabinet under <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> which you <pb xml:id="pg_151" n="151" facs="0181"/>and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> have been trying for so long to persuade <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to do.</item>
<item>6) Made no comments on presidium idea except to say it would not add much until sect affair cleaned up and authority central government established.</item>
</list>
<p>Based only on several conversations during two days in Paris, left with impression French officials now in charge Indochina affairs much more frank, open and closer to our viewpoints than heretofore, although there remain above differences of emphasis. While there may be some reservations in background French thinking not revealed during these conversations, <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName>’s impression is there is firmer agreement on overall objective in three Associated States and on stronger French intention work closely with us there.</p>

<p>4159. 1. I called on <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> 27th to review developments. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he had been rendered uneasy by telegrams received in Paris and although he had seen <persName corresp="#p_DJH1">Daridan</persName> and other subordinates since returning, he did not have a very clear picture of local situation. I told <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> that while I did not discount seriousness of situation, I had never viewed it as seriously as the French. Moreover, press accounts have tended to exaggerate crisis out of all proportions. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that press had caused difficulties for him likewise, since at time disturbing dispatches began to appear he was in Paris telling government that situation was improving.</p>
<p>2. I reviewed events leading to present crisis, and said I thought <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in past two days had put sects on the defensive psychologically and politically. Some of our newsmen have been to see <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName> in Southwest Cochin China and now have some appreciation of what a pirate he, for one, is. I said I had advised <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to continue to express willingness to carry on discussions with sect front. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in fact has handled himself well so far but should not be allowed to become over-confident. I added I was disturbed that Vietnamese Army morale might have been shaken by the present reduction in force. <pb xml:id="pg_152" n="152" facs="0182"/>On the other hand, sect troops are no less uncertain of their own future and so may not be eager to move against army.</p>
<p>3. With respect to position of the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he was disturbed by press accounts which tend to indicate <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> is not taking position in present crisis and accordingly is useless. He said that in his view Binh Xuyen had to be handled with great care otherwise there was danger of their going into Viet Minh underground, where they were 10 years ago. I asked <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> what he thought govt should do if Binh Xuyen forced its hand. He replied that govt should call on <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> as Chief of State to intervene. He said without going into larger question of ultimate role of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, present situation which finds chief of govt and chief of state 12,000 kilometers apart at time of crisis is inadmissible. I said I thought govt would not call upon <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, but on contrary would take action against Binh Xuyen if necessary. If that should develop, I asked <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>, would the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> prevent Binh Xuyen from being reinforced by troops moving in from outside Saigon. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that I was asking whether <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> would fight with Binh Xuyen. I said this was not my question; I was asking rather if fighting broke out in Saigon whether French would let reinforcements enter. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he found this question rather theoretical and could not undertake to answer it until he knew how political situation was likely to evolve. He continued by asking whether I thought <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> should fire on any troops attempting enter city. I reminded <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> that last September <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> blocked <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> forces which were attempting enter Saigon to support govt against General <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName>. At that time it was not necessary to fire on would-be reinforcements, nor in all likelihood would that be necessary now. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he would endeavor to keep out his reinforcements, but would not enter into direct conflict with Binh Xuyen. I countered by saying that if Binh Xuyen were reinforced, <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> might be obliged to intervene within city. In that case would it not be better to keep out reinforcements entirely and warn <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> in advance? I said I was convinced that if <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> knew he could not be reinforced, he would not act. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said it might be necessary for him to take a strong position, but he was concerned that nothing should be done to cause <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> to lose face. If latter felt he could avoid losing face only by military action, he would probably be tempted to take such action. He said that he hoped and thought he could restrain <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName>. Exactly how this could be done would depend upon evolution of political situation. I said I was much less concerned with <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName>’s loss of face than that govt should lose face. I felt sure govt would not bow to <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName>; [garble] it was dangerous to allow reinforcements to enter city, and that if <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> took the initiative, govt would react. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he believed situation was more complicated than that and could not be resolved simply by preventing reinforcements from entering Saigon.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_153" n="153" facs="0183"/>
<p>4. (<persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> appeared be not fully aware of precautionary measures already taken by <persName corresp="#p_JGPE1">Jacquot</persName>, who told me 26th that he was guarding road from Saigon to Bien Hoa and from Bien Hoa to Cap St. Jacques. <persName corresp="#p_JGPE1">Jacquot</persName> said he was taking over larger share of guard duty than Vietnamese have anticipated. He had told Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> that latter did not have to concern himself with assuring protection east of Donai River. <persName corresp="#p_JGPE1">Jacquot</persName> told me also he was keeping an eye on concentrations of empty junks on waterways which were more likely to be used than roads to transport sect reinforcements into Saigon. Additionally, <persName corresp="#p_JGPE1">Jacquot</persName> told me he had relieved Vietnamese of responsibility for guarding large sectors of Saigon. I did not mention any of these details to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and do not know how he will react when he learns of them. I am hopeful, however, of being able to soften his position that <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> should be used only for direct protection of French property and lives.)</p>
<p>5. I said there appeared to me to be tendency in Paris to consider sects and govt as on a par. In US view sects are rebels against legal govt. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that this was not the view in Paris. However, sects have military force, perhaps relatively more than the govt, and will probably use it rather than lose face. However, he said he did not believe situation had yet become that serious.</p>
<p>6. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> asked me how I thought the situation was likely to develop. I said there had been no incidents yet. I had urged <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to keep door open, as he is doing. The sects are not really united. Accordingly, I believed there would be negotiations, but no violence during next few days.</p>
<p>7. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> agreed with that analysis but went on to say that we must face up to problem of how to treat basic question of what place there is in Vietnamese society for the sects. In this connection <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has not followed our advice (1) to broaden his govt, and (2) to proceed cautiously in dealing with sects. I said I agreed with point (1), but not with point (2), and felt lack of prudence had been shown by sects rather than <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has said he is willing to change his govt but not to accept dictation from sects. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> agreed that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s present attitude with respect to sects is a good one.</p>
<p>8. I told <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> that US-French group studying possible solution of sect problem (<gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 4011<note n="2" xml:id="d77fn2">Dated March 21, not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/3–2155)</note>) has completed its work and has proposal to make to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and me. After this proposal has been presented and agreed to by us, I suggested it be communicated to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and elected ministers. If accepted by Vietnamese Govt <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should present it to sect leaders. However, this is a program designed principally to help sect troopers when demobilized not the leaders. Big problem remains of finding some admissible advantages capable of tempting sect leaders. <pb xml:id="pg_154" n="154" facs="0184"/><persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he thought sect leaders already have too much money to be tempted by that means, and moreover that to remove 2 or 3 leaders would not solve sect problem. I asked <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> what suggestions he had in this regard. He said he could think of nothing except what <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had already done, namely to leave door open for discussion. I asked what these talks should be about and whether we should advise <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in respect to them. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he thought it better to let these discussions develop naturally.</p>
<p>9. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he believed long range sect problem could be solved only by return of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> under conditions carefully stipulated in advance by French and US Govts. I asked how precisely this would solve sect problem. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he did not know but that he believed <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> could get the sects to accept many things which no one else could impose on them. I said I doubted that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would remain in office if <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> returned, unless latter returned as constitutional monarch in accordance with terms of a constitution.</p>
<p>10. I asked <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> his view of the joint démarche proposed Paris tel to Dept 4107 rptd Saigon 600,<note n="3" xml:id="d77fn3">See <ref target="#d73fn2">footnote 2, Document 73</ref>.</note> saying I thought it contained nothing new except one remark to be addressed to sects regarding their unacceptability to head a govt. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that since neither of us had received instructions, discussion of this matter could be postponed until later. I had the impression <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> is not keen to go ahead with joint démarche.</p>
<p>11. With reference to his trip to Paris, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> made following points:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) He believes that govt policy of support for South Vietnam will be clearer. He said he did not wish to accuse <persName corresp="#p_MFP1">Mendes</persName> govt of playing a double game with respect to Vietnam. However, since <persName corresp="#p_MFP1">Mendes</persName> govt was so often accused of that, <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> govt is determined to act so that it will not be subjected to same accusation.</item>
<item>(b) <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> has received French Govt agreement that when <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> has raised [<hi rend="italic">reached</hi>?] 75,000 level June 1, it will remain at that strength for some period, during which plans will be worked out for ultimate disposition of <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>.</item>
<item>(c) Certain funds were made available to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> for economic purposes, including refugee relief.</item>
</list>
<p>12. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that removal of Charbonnages equipment had been completed 26th. I congratulated him on this and said it was owing to him that program had succeeded. I went on to say that I felt things were not going well for Communists in north and therefore felt we should not allow ourselves to become too discouraged with regard to situation in south. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> cordially agreed with this analysis.</p>

<p>1. Following the presentation of the <gloss target="#t_TRIM1">TRIM</gloss> study on sects forces,<note n="2" xml:id="d78fn2">A memorandum of this portion of the conversation, which included also <persName corresp="#p_GGLCF1">General Gambiez</persName> and the U.S.-French <gloss target="#t_TRIM1">TRIM</gloss> Study Group headed by <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName>, is <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> Series VII, D.</note> Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> remained at <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName>’s invitation to continue a conversation held on 27 March.<note n="3" xml:id="d78fn3">See telegram 4159, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> said that in Sunday’s conversation he had the impression that he and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> were following the same line but that nevertheless there were certain points of possible difference which should be explored.</p>
<p>2. With regard to the sects, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> said they are an anachronistic survival and should be integrated into the society. He said, however, that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> saw the sects as anarchic groups in a normal society, whereas he sees them as highly organized bodies in an anarchic society. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> went on to say that the sects constitute the strongest anti-Viet Minh element in the South and that if elections were held under their jurisdiction, the Government could be certain of a 100% victory. However, if the sects are driven into the maquis by precipitate Government action, they risk being absorbed by the Viet Minh. In fact, <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Trinh Minh The</persName> are already heavily infiltrated by Viet Minh elements. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> said that he believes his view of the sects was not substantially different from <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName>’s.</p>
<p>3. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> said that so long as there is no National Assembly <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> must continue to play a part in Viet Nam. At the present he is at Cannes pulling wires. We should make it our business to insure that he is pulling wires in our behalf. He said he saw no necessary difficulties as between <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, so long as they were working in the same direction. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> said that there was no personal difference between him and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> with respect to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dao [<hi rend="italic">Dai</hi>]</persName>. But US public and congressional opinion is strongly against the Chief of State. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> interposed the remark that the French public opinion is also against <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, but he added that the latter would continue to play a part so long as there was no National Assembly. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> said that he had no way of judging exactly what Vietnamese opinion was regarding <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> replied that there is no way of knowing. Moreover public opinion is not so important here as in the West, and can be created. <pb xml:id="pg_156" n="156" facs="0186"/>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> asked what <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> thought <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s view of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> was. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> replied that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> hates <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> but would agree to his intervention if that were the only solution.</p>
<p>4. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> went on to say that as the situation has developed, we are now in a political impasse. It is no longer enough to deal with the superficial aspects of the problem. The problem must be attacked at its roots. Use of force, he added, is the worst possible solution. Since it is in an impasse, there seems to be no alternative for the Government except to turn to the source of legal authority. He said he felt that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could now take the initiative and undertake to set up conversations between <hi rend="italic">representatives</hi> of the Government on the one hand and of the sects on the other. Representatives will be able to reach agreement on certain points, but may have to refer others to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. If we, French and Americans, were back of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, and helping shape his decisions, this would be a workable system. It would not necessarily involve <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s return to Viet Nam. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> said that there seemed to be merit in <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s proposal and asked if the <gloss target="#t_TRIM1">TRIM</gloss> study would not be useful as the basis for one of these conversations. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> replied that it was exactly this sort of precise point which he had in mind for discussion. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> said that except for the question of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s serving as an arbiter, on which he reserved judgment, he agreed with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s proposal. He went on to say that if this proposal was adopted, he would have to make it very clear to the Department of State that he was not favoring negotiations between the sects and the Government as between two equal powers. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> replied that the situation is not dissimilar to the strikes in the Western countries, where the Government meets with strikers’ representatives without impairing its sovereignty. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> objected that the Government was under an ultimatum. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> said that the ultimatum had expired without incident and that the Government should move quickly so as to retain its freedom of action and not be subjected to a renewed threat. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> if he did not take seriously the threats of blockade and violence which are being broadcast by radio. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he did not take these seriously, but felt that the Government should move quickly before these threats took shape. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> agreed but said he wished to have more time to consider the question of using <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> said that somebody would have to arbitrate. It was agreed that they would discuss this matter at 3 p.m. on 29 March.<note n="4" xml:id="d78fn4">See <ref target="#d80">Document 80</ref>.</note></p>
<p>5. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> to report the highlights of his conversation of March 28 with President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> replied that he had reported on his trip to France and that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> appeared <pb xml:id="pg_157" n="157" facs="0187"/>satisfied with the present trend of French policy toward Viet Nam. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> recounted his present difficulties. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> stated, without going into the details stated above, that he had suggested to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that conversations should be undertaken between the sects and the Government. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> asked if he had proposed the use of representatives. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> said he had, explaining that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and the sects’ leaders were not on the same intellectual plane and accordingly possibly could not reach a meeting of the minds. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> asked if conversations were held by subordinates, whether there was any guarantee that these subordinates would be on a higher plane. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> replied that the sects’ leaders did have political advisors who are somewhat better than they. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> asked who should represent <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that he did not know except that he might propose one minister and one other person from <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s own office. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that he had also told <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that the Prime Minister should do everything possible to get <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> to work on his side.</p>
<p>6. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> said he was convinced that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> should not return at the present time, since this would probably render negotiations impossible. The sects’ leaders would turn immediately to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, who would become the focal point of endless intrigue. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> repeated that his plan did not necessarily entail <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s return, only that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> should be induced to work with the French and Americans. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> said this would involve a joint French-U.S. contact with <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> in France. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> replied that it would. He added that if <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> were to return in the next few days, that would solve nothing, since he is not adequately briefed. If it were agreed that he should come at a later time, that should be only under the strictest conditions imposed by France and the U.S.</p>
<p>7. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had indicated what he meant when he said he was willing to eliminate from his Cabinet certain ministers favorable to him. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that he had asked the question but the answer was not clear. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had said something about forming a Government of technicians. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> said we must solve this problem of how the sects are to participate in the Government. He asked <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> to consider this point so that they could discuss it later. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> said that the sects’ ministers have no idea of their jobs and it might be desirable that sect representation in the Government take the form of an advisory council without executive responsibility.</p>

<p>4192. 1. According to word given to <persName corresp="#p_OD1">O’Daniel</persName> by Vietnamese army officers 1300 March 29, Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName><note n="2" xml:id="d79fn2"><persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Ho Thong Minh</persName>.</note> has tendered resignation. I at once invited <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> to call on me and he told me following story: Morning March 29, <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> and Chief of Staff <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName> were summoned to Palace by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and informed that effective at once Colonel Nguyen Ngoc Le was to be named Chief of the National Police and Sûreté. Moreover, at 1330 National Army troops would take over Sûreté headquarters in heart of Saigon, guarded by Binh Xuyen commandos. In view seriousness this move, <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> advised President to delay action until plan had been approved by Cabinet excluding Sect members. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said that he had thought matter through and was determined to act, and had full powers to do so. <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> said under circumstances he had no alternative but to resign. At President’s invitation he thereupon sat down and wrote out resignation.</p>
<p>2. I told <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> that I fully sympathized with his point of view, and in his position would have done exactly same thing. He said in view of national interest and seriousness of local situation [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]. I urged him reconsider to the extent of withdrawing resignation temporarily. However, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had accepted resignation and would have to ask him (<persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName>) to reconsider. I told <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> that I would strongly urge President to do so, but advised <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> that he should accept only on condition that sound working relations were established between Prime Minister and himself. <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> agreed to consider seriously.</p>
<p>3. De Rougemont also called to see me at <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s request and reported following: <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had summoned <persName corresp="#p_WM1">Wintrebert</persName> to inform him of proposed action. <persName corresp="#p_WM1">Wintrebert</persName> at once reported to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> who sent <persName corresp="#p_WM1">Wintrebert</persName> back to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> accompanied by <persName corresp="#p_JGPE1">General Jacquot</persName> to urge that Nationalist troops not attempt to take over police and Sûreté headquarters and to emphasize serious view <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> took of proposed action. In course of discussion <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> shuttled between <persName corresp="#p_WM1">Wintrebert</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_JGPE1">Jacquot</persName> on the one hand, and Brother <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Luyen</persName> off stage on the other. Both Frenchmen were convinced that he, <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Luyen</persName>, was prime mover in this operation. However, <persName corresp="#p_WM1">Wintrebert</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_JGPE1">Jacquot</persName> secured <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s agreement not to move on police headquarters. (It is not yet clear, however, whether order naming Colonel Le as Director National Police and Sûreté has been implemented.)</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_159" n="159" facs="0189"/>
<p>4. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> was to have seen Brother <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Luyen</persName> at 1500 and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> immediately thereafter. Following this I will see <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and proceed forthwith to see <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s intention was to speak in most serious terms to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, as I intend to do.</p>

<p>1. I called on <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> 1630 29 March to hear his account of his conversation with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had finally agreed not to use force in taking over headquarters of national police and Sûreté. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> had offered to incorporate this building within his security zone and to secure evacuation Binh Xuyen commandos who were said to have occupied it. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was eager to fire police and Sûreté chief <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> at once and was prepared to accept Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName>’s resignation. Commissioner <persName corresp="#p_WM1">Wintrebert</persName> who was present said that brother <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Luyen</persName> was certainly back of this development. I told <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> that I was gravely disturbed by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s having taken steps of this gravity without consulting him or me.</p>
<p>2. Immediately after conversation with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> I called on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. I told him I was disturbed by developments and asked where the situation stood at that moment. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> replied that the Director of Police and Sûreté, <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName>, had been guilty of many acts of indiscipline, had permitted Binh Xuyen commandos to patrol streets and occupy police property. He added that he should have discharged <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> at the outset, but had instead been patient with him. Now, however, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said, it was impossible for him to insure internal security. He had attempted to reach <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> by telephone, but latter had refused to talk to him. Thereupon, he had taken steps to have the police headquarters occupied by army troops at 1330 and new Chief of Police and Sûreté installed. He added that Cabinet had twice authorized him to take any steps necessary to insure security. He had called in Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> and Chief of Staff <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName> and given them necessary orders. <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> told him that Cabinet should be asked to approve step of this gravity. He had replied that <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName>’s indiscipline was insupportable. <pb xml:id="pg_160" n="160" facs="0190"/><persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> had replied to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that he would be obliged to resign if Prime Minister’s order was carried out. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> that he could note in writing any objections he wished make to Prime Minister’s order but had no option but to execute it. <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> thereupon resigned. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> then gave formal order to Chief of Staff <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName> to execute occupation police headquarters. (Instead, <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName> called on <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and informed him that he would not execute order without <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s approval. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> apparently told him to suspend its execution.)</p>
<p>3. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> then said Commissioner <persName corresp="#p_WM1">Wintrebert</persName> called on Prime Minister at latter’s invitation immediately after departure of <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_WM1">Wintrebert</persName> promptly informed <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s plan. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> dispatched Generals <persName corresp="#p_JGPE1">Jacquot</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GGLCF1">Gambiez</persName> and Commissioner <persName corresp="#p_WM1">Wintrebert</persName> to Palace to warn President in strongest terms against execution of his order to seize police headquarters, adding that in any case he should not move until he had talked to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> finally agreed to suspend his orders. Meanwhile <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> sent his aide to inform me of situation.</p>
<p>4. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> had called on him at 1530 and warned him against attempting to seize police headquarters by force, saying this move could unleash serious disorders. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> offered to undertake to remove any Binh Xuyen commandos from police headquarters. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said he told <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> that he was head of the government and Interior Minister and had no choice except to move since Police Chief <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> was flouting his authority. He had calculated dangers and felt he could carry off coup without danger. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> added that he felt he had to strengthen his position against sects. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that there must be some other solution. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said he had replied that solution he proposed was correct one, even though he had agreed suspend its execution.</p>
<p>5. I told <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that in my judgment if his orders had been executed and force had been used there would have been severe fighting within city. Moreover his troops would have been hard pressed to take police headquarters without artillery. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> replied that he had studied situation carefully, that Binh Xuyen troops were <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName>, low in morale and would have surrendered. I told <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that no one I had consulted agreed with his analysis.<note n="3" xml:id="d80fn3"><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> did consult with <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName> on the morning of March 29. For <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName>’s account of the meeting with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, see <hi rend="italic">In the Midst of Wars,</hi> pp. 256–259.</note> Moreover, we had reports police headquarters had been mined. Additionally, troops protected by walls with machine guns sited to command approaches to building would have the advantage over attackers. Fighting could have been expected to break out in other parts of the city and this would have resulted in far greater losses than gains. Moreover French would probably have had to intervene. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> insisted however that he had <pb xml:id="pg_161" n="161" facs="0191"/>sufficient forces available to take police headquarters. I replied that without fighting it might be possible to solve present crisis by political means. The Binh Xuyen are in defensive positions and I believe that they would not initiate action against government.</p>
<p>6. With respect to Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName>, I told <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> I had heard from various sources that orders had been issued to army over <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName>’s head by brother <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Luyen</persName>. I reminded <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> I had warned him <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> might resign if he continued circumvent him. I added that I shared <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName>’s view of this problem. I went on to say that if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> accepted <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName>’s resignation he might be confronted with situation as grave as that presented by <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName> rebellion. I said that he should not attempt to take on all opposition forces at one time. I advised <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to let French secure Binh Xuyen evacuation of police headquarters and recommended that he himself should attempt work out an arrangement with <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> whereby latter would remain in office. I told <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that in my opinion he had succeeded in out-maneuvering sects up to the present but was now risking open strife with them. I warned him that without <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> he might not secure loyal support of army. I added that before he took such action he should have consulted <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and me. I said that as he knew I have supported him 100 percent and urged him sit down with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and me to work out solution to problem. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> objected that <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> does not have same appreciation of situation as he does. I told <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that he should have called a Cabinet meeting, as <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> recommended, and said that nothing serious would have happened during course of day if he had delayed. I told him that by acting alone he was needlessly antagonizing others and might end by governing Viet Nam with help of his two brothers alone. These steps had threatened the life of the government and were not worth the candle.</p>
<p>7. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> reacted quickly to suggestion that he was governing largely with aid of his brothers, denying allegation, and saying that he had had to act before situation got worse. I told him that in fact the situation before this latest action was improved. I said if he forced the hand of the opposition by military action he would risk losing everything. I said again that he should let French peaceably remove Binh Xuyen from police headquarters, that he should consult with his ministers and that he should request <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> to suspend his resignation. In this connection, Vietnamese army officers had be-sought <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> not to resign. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said that in last crisis he had been told the army was for <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName>, which was not true.</p>
<p>8. I said that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and I were planning to meet with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in day or two to suggest solutions for sect demobilization problem and that if he forced the issue now in this manner he would be making the gravest mistake of his career. I added that I was entirely out of sympathy with his actions. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> insisted stubbornly that <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> and he <pb xml:id="pg_162" n="162" facs="0192"/>do not see things in same light and that <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> must go. He himself would retain Defense portfolio and give Interior Ministry to some other minister, unnamed. I told <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that he must learn how to handle strong men who disagree with him since the knack of governing consists largely in that skill. I said that I would be obliged to report to my government that he was making a serious mistake and unnecessarily threatening life of his government.</p>
<p>9. I asked <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> what Cabinet changes he had in mind in letter he addressed to General <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> gave unsatisfactory reply indicating that he proposed doubling up ministries, using present Cabinet members.</p>
<p>10. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> General <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName> was coming to see him evening 29th to ask that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> incorporate <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName>’s 8,000 men, of whom 1,000 have already been integrated, into army. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> indicated he intended to integrate <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName>’s men so that <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName> would no longer be answerable to <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai Pope</persName>. When I asked how these troops would be paid, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said that once they had been integrated steps could be taken for the demobilization of some of their numbers.</p>
<p>11. I told <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that I had made few requests of him during my tour in Viet Nam. However I was obliged to ask him to request <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> to withdraw his resignation, even if only temporarily. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> replied that the resignation at present is in suspense. I said that <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> might not think so and that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> risked grave dangers of army rebellion if <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> left the government. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> referred in answer to <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName>’s “clique” as an objectionable element of the General Staff. I said once again that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> must accustom himself to opposition.</p>
<p>12. In conclusion, I said that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was making it very difficult for me to continue supporting his government. I said that if he continued his present course we would be under heavy pressure to support a change in the government. If it were not for refugees, for whom we have heavy responsibility, I feared I might have to recommend withdrawal of U.S. support. I asked that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> take following three steps: (a) that he attempt to gain <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName>’s acceptance to remain in government, (b) that he work out specific proposal for revamping Cabinet, to be discussed with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and me and (c) that he consult <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and me before taking any additional critical steps whatever. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> replied he would think over situation and might give me call later in evening.</p>
<p>13. After leaving <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> I called on <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and reported above conversation.

<p>4213. Following account of events based on observation Embassy staff and American press correspondent, and on Vietnamese army sources:</p>
<p>1. At midnight Saigon–Cholon prefectural police headquarters attacked by approximately 80 Binh Xuyen stationed in adjoining police school. Police headquarters previously reinforced by National Army paratroopers and further reinforced after Binh Xuyen attack by other National Army elements. National forces had consolidated their control of police headquarters area by 1:30 morning 30th. Total casualties this engagement approximately 10 killed, 50 wounded.</p>
<p>2. Simultaneously with Binh Xuyen attack on police headquarters, mortar shells were fired into ground President’s Palace. 2 shells hit wing of Palace, 3 more landed in Palace grounds, a few other in nearby area. 5 wounded at Palace grounds; 2 at or near neighboring French High Commissariat Office.</p>

<p>4230. 1. I called on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> noon 30th at his request. I told him I believed Binh Xuyen were responsible for outbreak of hostilities and expressed regret this action had occurred. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said Binh Xuyen had been prepared act against govt for some time. Now that Binh Xuyen have taken to arms he saw no alternative except to remove control national police and sûreté from Chief <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> soonest. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> had cautioned him against precipitate action but at 0330 30th in discussing action <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> might take if <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> assumed overall command, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> declined say specifically whether or not he would remove <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d82fn2"><persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s account of this discussion with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> as reported to <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> is in telegram 4220 from Saigon, March 30. (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>)</note> When <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> called again on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> at 0830, <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> said <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> had indicated he thought <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> did not wish him assume command. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said he had replied he was not opposed in principle but wanted to know <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s plan of action. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that he would move to restore order by separating hostile elements. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> complained to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> that latter was putting govt and sects on same plane. Moreover <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s plan did not provide for neutralization Binh Xuyen headquarters (on southern outskirts Cholon) from which attacks could be launched on city at any time. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> also informed <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that he did not know how the fight had begun. I reminded <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> at that time had had no intelligence briefing on night’s happenings.</p>
<p>2. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> had proposed (at my suggestion) that <persName corresp="#p_GGLCF1">General Gambiez</persName> arbitrate between govt and sects. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had complained to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> this implied equality between two parties. Moreover govt in his view should rely on its own forces and could not escape its responsibilities. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said that he had told <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> Binh Xuyen would have to be disarmed or wiped out and that according to recent memo from DefMin <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> and Chief of Staff <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName>, Vietnamese Army had enough potential in city to handle any situation.</p>
<p>3. I asked <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> where he stood at that moment. He said he was still determined to destroy or drive out Binh Xuyen, since it was better latter should be in Maquis rather than constitute threat in city. Cabinet morning 30th had been advised of all steps taken and had approved any additional steps needed to restore order. All ministers except sects representatives and Minister for Plan, absent from country, were present. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said that he would ask <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> to lend him all possible assistance saying that if French and govt could not handle <pb xml:id="pg_165" n="165" facs="0195"/>sects’ threat there was no use in <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s attempting to carry on. He added that if Binh Xuyen renew attack night of 30–31 they will meet artillery fire.</p>
<p>4. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said he had received support from Generals <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TM1">The</persName> who said they expected govt attack Binh Xuyen headquarters and offered to carry out operation. Chief of Staff <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName> had said army had been attacked and must react. <persName corresp="#p_WM1">Wintrebert</persName> had said <persName corresp="#p_JGPE1">Jacquot</persName> was agreeably surprised by discipline and high morale shown by National Army troops. I told <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that in my view everything possible should be done to prevent further fighting. I suggested <persName corresp="#p_GGLCF1">General Gambiez</persName> serve not as an arbitrator but as a mediator. I went on to say that if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had tried as planned afternoon 29th to take National Police Headquarters by force a fire fight would have resulted. He had been well advised accept counsel given by <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and me since it now appears certain Binh Xuyen launched last night’s attack, which gives him political and psychological advantage. I advised <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to attempt negotiations rather than continue open fighting but be fully prepared to act if Binh Xuyen should move again.</p>
<p>5. <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> General <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName> has asked <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to integrate 8,000 of his troops, of whom 3,000 are already integrated, into National Army. These troops would be transferred to National Army training center and all ties with <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> sect cut. I told <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that he must make decision but I should point out this would affect demobilization plans and perhaps force more rapid demobilization toward end of year. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said he had warned <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName> that some of his forces would have to be discharged later. He added to me that he was most reluctant to take this step but felt he had no alternative.</p>
<p>6. I told <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> I hoped it would be possible to find some means of preserving peace for next few days, and thought that some solution might be worked out if Binh Xuyen were removed from city. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> replied that he knew there were serious risks involved but if he did not move rapidly Binh Xuyen might combine against him with other sects. I said it would be worth deal to gain time enough to force sects to accept political solution.</p>
<p>World press now seems to be with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. I agreed however, that he would have to remove National Police Chief <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> and suggested French might help clear out Central Sûreté Headquarters near Cathedral by peaceful means.</p>
<p>7. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> had attended morning’s Cabinet meeting as observer and that his resignation had taken effect. I said I hoped it would be possible for <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> to remain in office. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said there were too many differences of opinion between him and <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> for this to be possible. I urged <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to proceed rapidly with plans for reorganization his Cabinet.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_166" n="166" facs="0196"/>
<p>8. <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> called on me 1300 30th to say he was gravely perturbed that news of his resignation, which he did not release, might have precipitated armed action. He feared Binh Xuyen had taken resignation as signal government intended move against them and so seized initiative. <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> said he intended issue an Order of the Day 30th explaining reasons for his resignation. I persuaded <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> that an Order of the Day would be contrary to national interest and secured his agreement not to issue. Beyond that, <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> agreed only to remain in caretaker capacity until relieved by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>
<p>9. I met with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> at 1500 30th to review with him my latest conversation with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. I told <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> I was sure <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> intended remove <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> and I saw no alternative. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said this was contrary to advice he had given to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. I said I had given no advice in this respect but still saw no alternative.</p>
<p>10. I mentioned my conversation with <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he agreed with <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName>’s point of view and considered latter’s resignation serious blow to government. He said he disapproved entirely of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s policy with respect to sects. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that he entirely disagreed with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s point of view and that he believed <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could not maintain order. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, he said, had wanted him take over command in order conduct operations against Binh Xuyen. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said it would be “criminal”<note n="3" xml:id="d82fn3">The quote is not closed in the source text.</note> for the French to get mixed up in civil war. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> would agree accept command only in order separate opposing forces. He went on to say that he had had long interview with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> morning 30th and had been very badly impressed. He believed <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was concerned with saving his personal face and honor, and not with serving national interest. He said <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was suffering “hallucinations” and had not just appreciation of limits of his means. I replied that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is in very difficult position and that his government is faced with rebellion. I for one have no sympathy whatever for Binh Xuyen. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said it was not question of having sympathy for Binh Xuyen but of judging <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s policies which had put US into present predicament. I objected that any Prime Minister would have had to face sect problem sooner or later or else knuckle under and let sects maintain their feudal systems. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said there were other possible policies. <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> for example had resigned in protest against <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s course of action. I said that nevertheless to my knowledge no one had been able to suggest a constructive substitute for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s policies.</p>
<p>11. I suggested to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> that we accept fact that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would remove <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName>. I added that some means should be found to isolate police headquarters and cut off its utilities. Otherwise <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would be tempted to storm it. I regretted that was the only constructive suggestion I had to make. I added that I believed he would not move <pb xml:id="pg_167" n="167" facs="0197"/>against Binh Xuyen headquarters except in response to Binh Xuyen attack. (In case of such attack, I would sympathize with any action government might take but would not advise <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to seize initiative in attacking.) I felt that Binh Xuyen had resorted to violence in order to demonstrate that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could not control country. If <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> did not fight back government was lost. I repeated my earlier suggestion that if <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> wished to avoid renewal hostilities he warn Binh Xuyen they could not be reinforced from outside. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that no reinforcements had been received 29th. Moreover, there are many “troubling factors” in the situation and he is not certain that Binh Xuyen actually attacked first. For example he said Binh Xuyen forces engaged were outnumbered by government troops by one to two, or possibly three. I said that simultaneous shelling of Palace and attack on police commissariat indicated to me that Binh Xuyen were responsible. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> planned two operations yesterday according to his information, one of which was scheduled for 1330 to seize police headquarters and another scheduled for midnight. He said that same National Army battalion commander who participated in midnight operation had been scheduled to conduct earlier operation. I said that this did not constitute proof in my view. I added that situation was no doubt grave and that I earnestly hoped there would be no fighting night of 30/31. I said however that if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> moved against police headquarters I thought he would move at same time against Binh Xuyen headquarters. Since Binh Xuyen have no artillery I believed National Army, with proper attack, could destroy Binh Xuyen headquarters. I said also that if <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> took over command that would be the end politically for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> since sects would be able to claim they had won and that this was true. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he would not, of course, take command unless <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> wishes. He had offered to do so only in order to save <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. I said his taking command might prevent bloodshed but would not save <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. I asked if <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> would attempt to have Binh Xuyen evacuate police headquarters peaceably. He said he would try but was doubtful of success. I asked if he would suggest to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that police headquarters be isolated rather than attacked and if he would assist in cutting off services to this building. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that he would see what could be done. I concluded conversation by saying I did not know whether <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would or would not accept my advice to move forcibly against Binh Xuyen.</p>
<p>12. My conversations with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> convinced me French are not shocked, as are we, by suggestion that government and rebellious sects be treated as on a par. I noted also that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> is not convinced that Binh Xuyen were responsible for opening hostilities against government.</p>

<p>I strongly feel we should not treat Government and rebellious sects on an equal plane as conversations with French officials have clearly shown they are doing. Re paragraph 12 your 4230<note n="2" xml:id="d83fn2"><hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note> you may inform <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> I consider it imperative for French and American representations in Saigon to uphold full authority of National Government and Prime Minister take such measures as necessary and appropriate maintain integrity and order and proceed with reform program. Otherwise there will be no stability and no chance for political and other progress in Free Viet-Nam. However tenuous and critical present situation may be as a result of challenge from sects and resignations from cabinet, it is earnestly hoped <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will follow your sound advice and seize this opportunity to reconstitute as strong broadly based and competent administration as is possible with what he has to work with.

<pb xml:id="pg_169" n="169" facs="0199"/>
<p>1. In light of recent developments we must now squarely face fact <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is operating practically one-man government with his two brothers <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Luyen</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> as principal advisors. I seriously doubt this can last long.</p>
<p>2. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is, in fact, almost entirely isolated. Four Hoa Hao members of government have resigned. Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Minh</persName>, an independent, has resigned. Four Cao Dai members of government have now submitted their resignations to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in spite of “integration” <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> forces into National Army March 31, ostensibly “to give <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> free hand to form non-political government of technicians”. (Please don’t expect me to explain this gobble-de-gook.) Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> and his Tinh Than colleagues have today reluctantly withdrawn their resignations, we are told, on condition <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> (a) seek political solution rather than solution based on force and (b) consult members Cabinet concerning government policies. This is second warning Tinh Than group has given <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, the first being in January. I seriously doubt <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will be able change his nature actually consult his ministers and treat them as working team. This compromise therefore may not last very long. Top leaders National Army are showing no enthusiasm for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. General <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Vy</persName> has told me emphatically he is opposed engaging National Army in civil war. General <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName> is proving to be weak reed we feared he might be. Adherence March 31 <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> forces under General <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName> to national government cannot be considered as element of lasting strength for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> though he believes it is.</p>
<p>3. I am convinced that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has had fair chance to establish effective govt. He himself has produced little if anything of a constructive nature. we have found it necessary assist him in proposing, drafting and attempting to breathe life into most of his programs. We have done everything in our power to support and aid him. We have done our best to get him to change his method of operating. There can be no question but that French in recent past have not only ceased in general to obstruct <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> but under <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s guidance have been making positive efforts assist him. Major portion responsibility for critical situation in which <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> now finds himself must in all fairness be laid squarely at <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s own door.</p>
<p>4. It is possible that with his temperament and demonstrated inability work in team spirit with anyone but his brothers, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> might, without consciously being aware of it, attempt to govern with rubber-stamp Cabinet. I am convinced such an effort would be <pb xml:id="pg_170" n="170" facs="0200"/>short-lived as country will not stand for type of “government by family” offered it by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> brothers.</p>
<p>5. I believe it is, therefore, essential to consider possible alternatives to present situation. We have been giving thought to this in past few days as it appears <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government may fall through process of dissolution, through efforts of sects, or even by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s own resignation concerning which we have received hints which will be outlined in subsequent message.<note n="3" xml:id="d84fn3"><hi rend="italic">Infra.</hi></note></p>
<p>6. It appears alternatives in order of desirability would be as follows:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) New government to be formed with <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Tran Van Do</persName> as President;</item>
<item>(b) Same as (a) but under <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>;</item>
<item>(c) <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> to return in support of a new government to be formed and led by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>;</item>
<item>(d) <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> to return and assume presidency over a new government.</item>
</list>
<p>7. <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> is not a very strong man and might refuse to assume responsibility for government, but if he agreed we believe he might have best opportunity succeed in establishing a broader government including best of present ministers who are familiar with current programs. He has ability to work with other people and seems to know how to decentralize. I feel sure he would be willing to bring into government men like Dr. <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>, who is a personal friend.</p>
<p>8. While I personally believe <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> is a stronger and more able man than <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName>, my reasons for suggesting <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> as second choice are that he is identified as northerner and member of Dai Viet Party which is unpopular in south and which some blame, however incorrectly, for loss of Tonkin. Sects might object strongly to <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> and in present situation this could be major factor. If <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> were to refuse to form a government <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> would be next best choice from our point of view.</p>
<p>9. See part 2, para 3b, <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 2250 rptd Paris 706<note n="4" xml:id="d84fn4">Dated December 13, 1954; for text, see <ref target="frus1952-54v13p2"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1952–1954, vol. XIII, Part 2</ref>, p. 2362.</note> for discussion of conditions which might govern return of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>.</p>
<p>10. Problem of sects will remain, no matter who heads government. But present impasse must be broken very quickly. As I have mentioned above, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> may decide to resign. If he stays in office and presses for military action against the sects he is very likely to have insubordination in the army. This would lead to conditions worse than those existing last fall and would be intolerable.</p>

<p>4264. Part I.</p>
<p>1. I called on <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> at 1230 March 31.<note n="2" xml:id="d85fn2">A memorandum of this conversation, drafted by <persName corresp="#p_SPJ1">Sturm</persName>, is in <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> Papers, Vietnam File, Series VIII, Memos for Record.</note> <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> reviewed events since meeting of March 30 and said at 1630 yesterday <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> summoned <persName corresp="#p_WM1">Wintrebert</persName> and asked him to have <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> name <persName corresp="#p_GGLCF1">General Gambiez</persName> as mediator between the Binh Xuyen and government. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he did so and as result truce had been reached which he thought would last 48 hours.</p>
<p>2. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> to help in working out reduction of Binh Xuyen forces in Saigon police posts. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> commented to me that Binh Xuyen personnel were in fact in the process of being reduced in these posts even before <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s request reached him.</p>
<p>3. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> then said <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> had called morning 31st and informed him that during conversation with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> earlier, latter had been very abrupt. Accordingly, <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName>’s resignation still stands but remains in suspense. I commented I regarded the situation as most serious and stated I believed if <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> and his group did resign government could not last very long.</p>
<p>4. I asked <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> if my suggestion that National Sûreté <gloss target="#t_HQ1">HQ</gloss> building be isolated had been studied. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> replied it had been investigated but it was found it would not yet be practical to cut off utilities to that building. I then suggested perhaps communications to <pb xml:id="pg_172" n="172" facs="0202"/>this <gloss target="#t_HQ1">HQ</gloss> could be cut. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> replied that Binh Xuyen, occupying strategic positions outside city, would probably react by cutting much of Saigon’s communications with outside world.</p>
<p>5. I then said I believed we must accept principle that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> relieve <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> and that this would be less dangerous if new chief were temporarily established in a new Sûreté <gloss target="#t_HQ1">HQ</gloss> perhaps in Commissariat on Boulevard Gallieni. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> stated he agreed <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> should be relieved but felt this was not the proper time. He feared that if <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> is relieved now it will only increase tension. I suggested <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> inform <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that, when <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> can be replaced without risk, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> will establish necessary communications for new Chief of Sûreté to operate someplace other than the present Sûreté building. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he would do this.</p>
<p>6. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> then stated he felt we must continue support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> not only for well-known international political reasons but because within country his departure might have effect causing rupture between Central and South Viet Nam. However, he said, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> must be persuaded to be more conciliatory and enlarge government, otherwise the country would become enmeshed in civil war. As possible solution to current situation, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> suggested that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> give <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> the mission of contacting all political sectors of society to determine how best to arrive at such enlargement of government. He feels that this offers best possibility for getting <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to strengthen Cabinet. I said I would consider proposal and discuss with him later.</p>
<p>7. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he was aware of reports that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> might resign and take blast at U.S. and France. He added that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would also no doubt try to drive wedge between France and U.S.</p>
<p>8. In course of conversation <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> stated forcefully he intended establish and maintain order and prevent civil war even if that involved putting <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> under arrest.</p>
<p>Part II.</p>
<p>1. I called on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> 1700 March 31 at his invitation. He told me he had received two telegrams from <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, one in clear and one in code, referring to armed conflict night 29/30, expressing grave concern and saying no previous government had permitted armed clash between Vietnamese leading to bloodshed. Last sentence of coded message said <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> would be waiting for indication of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s “intentions”. I asked <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> what this meant. He said he didn’t know, perhaps <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> was asking whether he intended wage war on sects. (<persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Colonel Lansdale</persName>, who had been at Palace all morning, said that brother <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Luyen</persName> had said this meant <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> was asking <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would resign. He said he believed <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> thought Vietnamese army was responsible for starting conflict.) (This is becoming official French line.) He said that purpose of his inviting me to call was to ask if I would agree send telegram to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> explaining present situation and saying government has affair well in hand. I said that I <pb xml:id="pg_173" n="173" facs="0203"/>had reported fully to my government my belief that Binh Xuyen forces were responsible for conflict but I could not agree to act as intermediary between him and <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. However, I said I would see what I could do. (If Department approves I suggest Embassy Paris be instructed to brief Imperial Cabinet representatives Paris, on basis my recent telegrams.)</p>
<p>2. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> were best element among sects, as they had proved by their adherence to his reply of 24th to sect ultimatum of which principal element was concept of single army. <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> ministers, he said, had resigned in order permit complete secularization of <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> military and political activities and even <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai Pope</persName> had signed private agreement with his colleagues releasing <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> forces for integration into National Army. I said I wished I could be as optimistic as President as to validity and lasting quality of any such agreement.</p>
<p>3. I asked <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> where he stood with <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Tran Van Do</persName>. He said he had invited <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> to call this morning. <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> had insisted on urgency of solving political question and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> asked him to submit in writing plan to resolve impasse. I asked if Tinh Than ministers were remaining in government. He said yes and that resignations had been submitted only to free <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> hands in forming new Cabinet. I warned <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that if <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> and his associates left government it would be difficult for him to continue as Prime Minister. (<persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> had informed me that he was still opposed to the use of force in dealing with sect problem, as were some of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s generals.) I urged him have complete Cabinet discussion before he took any further action and to seek a political solution in next week or ten days. If <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> determined on military operations he would find no French support and probably little National Army support.</p>
<p>4. I said that he must quickly get new blood in his Cabinet and delegate authority to competent ministers. Otherwise there was danger of imminent collapse of government. I told <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> and Australian diplomatic representatives as well as <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> agreed with me in this regard. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said that he intended to reform his government “now that sect front is dissolved”. I reminded him that he had dealt only with <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> and that Binh Xuyen and Hoa Hao still opposed him. I encouraged him to move ahead quickly on political front, announce new government and re-state his programs. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said he was proposing to make indirect political contacts tonight with various circles to see what were the possibilities for forming a new Cabinet. I asked if he intended to invite into his government men of caliber of <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>, who might not always agree with him. He gave no direct answer but said he was willing to consult with <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>. I suggested that he consult his Cabinet fully on all major policies saying that unless assurance to that effect was given he could not get good <pb xml:id="pg_174" n="174" facs="0204"/>men. I suggested he use one of his ministers, in particular <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Tran Van Do</persName>, to take political soundings for him and to draw up list of possible members. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said he would not do this until he had seen <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName>’s plans for government reorganization (mentioned above) but he agreed to discuss matter with <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> soonest.</p>
<p>5. I told him I thought sects would never agree to renounce all participation in government and asked him if he would consider establishing some sort of Council of Elders, without power, but in which membership would confer some prestige. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said that he had already thought of that and would give it further study.</p>
<p>6. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> indicated that he was still highly irritated that French had not allowed him storm National Police <gloss target="#t_HQ1">HQ</gloss> in central Saigon. He muttered threats to effect that if he was much longer frustrated in his plans for dealing with Binh Xuyen he would resign and write a “white paper”.</p>
<p>Part III.</p>
<p>I met with <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Tran Van Do</persName> later night 31 March and told him of conversation with President. He indicated that while he had left his resignation and those of his colleagues with President, they would remain in government unless President took some drastic action that might lead to civil war. He agreed to undertake with help of Embassy staff officer to draft plan for reorganization of government and to suggest list of new Cabinet ministers for submission to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. He will consult with President about this morning 1 April. (We hope some good may have come of this, but still are somewhat skeptical of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s acceptance of idea.)</p>

<p>At 0015 on 1 April <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Colonel Lansdale</persName> came to the Embassy Residence and saw me. He said that he had just come from the Palace and that:</p>
<list>
<item>(1) The Government was sending a letter to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> immediately requesting <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s authority to move Vietnamese troops through the <pb xml:id="pg_175" n="175" facs="0205"/>French-protected section of town in the event the Binh Xuyen attacked the Vietnamese Army,</item>
<item>(2) That in the event <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> refused to grant this permission to the Government, President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would send a letter shortly (in the early hours of the morning) to the Ambassador requesting his good offices to intercede with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> to procure this permission for the Vietnamese, and</item>
<item>(3) That in the event of an attack by the Binh Xuyen the President was going to call on Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName> asking them to come to the Palace and give him advice.</item>
</list>
<p>In view of the embarrassing position which such a letter forwarded to the Ambassador by the President in the middle of the night might cause the Ambassador and the President should the Ambassador refuse to intercede and become an intermediary between the Vietnamese and the French, I felt it wise to awaken the Ambassador to determine if he wished to block such an action. I informed the Ambassador of the information contained in paragraph 1 above and he stated:</p>
<list>
<item>(1) He would receive no letter from the Government that night, and</item>
<item>(2) Neither he nor <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName> would go to the Palace and give advice to the Government in the event of attack.</item>
</list>
<p>I informed <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName> of the Ambassador’s decision and urged him to take such measures as necessary to prevent President from making such requests of the Ambassador. As we were discussing this the Ambassador came out of his room and reiterated his above decision, directing <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName>, Redick and Potter (who had also dropped in) to go home and go to bed and keep away from the Palace and such absurd activities. He assured them that the French would not permit the Binh Xuyen to launch an attack that night.</p>

<p>At 1:30 p.m. today I received a call from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> at which time he asked me to come down and discuss the Vietnam situation which he said was getting progressively worse. I met with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, Assistant Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Walter S. Robertson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Ken Young</persName> in charge of the Southeast Asia desk at 4:00 p.m. and there, read certain cables relative to the situation in Vietnam. In these cables, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> said that the recent coming over of 10,000 Codao [<hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName>
</hi>] troops was probably of only a temporary nature; that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s brothers were very close to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>; and that the possibilities were that difficulties of very grave nature might arise shortly. He seemed to imply that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was too rigid; his authority too personal; and that team-work in the cabinet was lacking.</p>
<p>He offered four alternatives:</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_177" n="177" facs="0207"/>
<list>
<item>1. That if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was replaced, he would be replaced by <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Tran Van Do</persName>.</item>
<item>2. That he be replaced by <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>.</item>
<item>3. That <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> exert some sort of pressure on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to broaden his government.</item>
<item>4. That <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> return to Vietnam as President with the retention of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> as Premier.</item>
</list>
<p>When asked for my opinion, I said I thought all four alternatives were worse than keeping <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in office; that we did not have too much time; that if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> quit or was overthrown, there would very likely be civil war; and that as a result that <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> could walk in and take the country without any difficulty. I suggested that someone from the Paris Embassy be sent down to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and that if necessary, serious consideration be given to subsidizing him, in part at least, for revenues which may have been lost through <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s crack down on the Binh Xuyen. I also suggested that if it could be worked in some fashion that contact be established with <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>; to use his influence to get <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to take <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> into the Cabinet either as Minister of Defense or Minister of the Interior. <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> seems to be the one man everyone except Binh Xuyen seems to think should be in the Cabinet. The most difficult person to deal with is <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName>, head of the Binh Xuyen who has not been in contact with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> for the past two months even though efforts have been made by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to arrange a meeting with him.</p>
<p>While <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName> seems to be the first military leader, the defection of his Cao Daist [?] to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and the blessings by their Pope has taken away a lot of his strength. My parting suggestions were to contact <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> along the lines enumerated above and to try to find ways and means of getting <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to accept <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> into his cabinet.</p>

<p>On reviewing the recent telegrams from Saigon, I have the uneasy feeling that the French in particular and our people to some extent have overcautioned <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> on taking actions against the Binh Xuyen. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> arranged a truce which I am not sure was well-timed. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> has been using very strong pressure on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> not to take action against the Binh Xuyen. My hunch is this has all been bad advice. The Binh Xuyen have to be dealt with severely and often with bloodshed, if necessary, sooner or later. Their leader will rebel against any central authority he does not absolutely control. While it might have worked out better if this challenge had come three or four months later, when the national army is in better shape, it is obvious to me from my talks in Saigon that the sect leaders knew the jig was up and moved before it was too late.</p>
<p>I don’t think the State Department can directly encourage <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to take forceful action against the Binh Xuyen and its leader. However, I am baffled as to how we must continue—whether <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should not be thwarted in putting down this rebellion. Attempts for a reconciliation will just put off the evil day unless the Binh Xuyen leader, General <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Vien</persName>, submits without reserve to central authority.</p>
<p>The best thing I know to do is to get a telegram off to <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> asking him to evaluate the situation. Furthermore we have not received from Saigon any over-all estimate of the situation.</p>

<p>Would appreciate estimate of national government’s capabilities vis-à-vis Binh Xuyen in Saigon–Cholon area. <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Can</persName> government rely on national army battalions in this area? Are they adequately equipped and supplied with ammunition? If so, can government bring Binh Xuyen under full control by whatever means necessary? We have seen . . . report, . . . that French have consistently refused issue sufficient reserve ammunition to national army battalions which, according this report, have only four hours reserve supply for <pb xml:id="pg_179" n="179" facs="0209"/>heavy fighting. <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Can</persName> French action be verified? Would also appreciate whatever assessment can be made of Viet Minh infiltration and instigation Binh Xuyen or otherwise Saigon area.</p>
<p>Now that <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> leaders appear to have rallied to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, what are estimates outcome of Binh Xuyen and Hoa Hao challenge to government?</p>

<p>4284. For <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> from Secretary. Your 4263 rptd Paris 1141 and 4264 rptd Paris 1142.<note n="2" xml:id="d90fn2"><ref target="#d84">Documents 84</ref> and <ref target="#d85">85</ref>.</note></p>
<p>1. Re alternatives to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, we do not think that switch would be desirable or practicable at present time. We still think we should continue to back <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. we particularly note from 4264 that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Gen. Ely</persName> shares that view. While situation is complex and sensitive, it appears preferable to us to continue support for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and concentrate all our efforts to getting backing for his government. Every avenue should be explored, as you have been doing, to arrive at workable solution along these lines. We doubt that there is any acceptable alternative which we could back on the scale necessary for success.</p>
<p>2. However you should feel free, if situation becomes acutely critical, to speak frankly to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that unless he can do better than he is now doing we may have to cease U.S. support for Viet-Nam which will jeopardize not only himself but the whole country. Surely he must feel an obligation to all patriots who have come down by the hundreds of thousands in hope of getting refuge in Free Viet-Nam. We strongly hope this regrettable decision by U.S. will not be forced upon us.</p>
<p>3. In your discretion you may put question directly to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> for me as to his intentions regarding broadening and strengthening of his government with competent ministers. You may say that U.S. Government is deeply concerned over present developments in Viet-Nam, hopes that effective government under his premiership can be immediately formed and that, as I mentioned to him in Saigon, U.S. <pb xml:id="pg_180" n="180" facs="0210"/>has tremendous stake in success of his administration and Free Viet-Nam. We have consistently backed him.</p>
<p>4. With respect to settlement of sect problem, I wonder if we may not have been moving too fast in trying to establish strong central government and rapidly and substantially liquidate control and jurisdiction of <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> and Hoa Hao. I would like your further views and recommendations on developing workable relationship in civil and military matters between central government and two sect organizations. If there are any financial problems regarding integration of sect forces into national army, please inform me. But I do not see how <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> as Prime Minister can accept having Saigon and central police under jurisdiction of group not under control of central government.</p>
<p>5. Although <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> advocates continuing support for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, I am astonished at his remark that he might even have to put <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> under arrest to prevent civil war (para. 8, Part I your 4264), whereas he indicated he would not use <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> prevent Binh Xuyen reinforcement your 4159.<note n="3" xml:id="d90fn3"><ref target="#d77">Document 77</ref>.</note> we should not treat Prime Minister and government as inferior to rebellious sect leaders whom French apparently regard as immune from arrest by them. Fundamental challenge to central authority is involved, among other things, in this crisis.</p>
<p>6. For <persName corresp="#p_ATC1">Achilles</persName>: I concur in <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> suggestion para, one, Part I [<hi rend="italic">II</hi>] his 4264 repeated Paris 1142, and you should convey to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> in manner you consider most effective, views expressed in para. 1 and 3 of this telegram. If possible, it should be impressed on <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> that he could make contribution in this critical situation by using his influence with Hoa Hao and Binh Xuyen to accept authority central government and accede to political settlement.</p>
<p>7. You may inform <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> substance this telegram.</p>

<p>4292. 1. I called on <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> 2000 April 1 at his urgent request. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that he had just come from a very difficult conversation with <pb xml:id="pg_181" n="181" facs="0211"/><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> had tried to be as soothing as possible, had said he understood Police Chief <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> would have to be removed, said he was willing to help <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> set up a new police chief in another headquarters, but insisted time not yet ripe for this move. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was more excited and more determined than ever to carry out an armed assault on National Police <gloss target="#t_HQ1">HQ</gloss> in central Saigon. He believed at same time <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would launch series attacks on police posts throughout city. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> interpreted <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s mood as readiness to “put city to sword and flame to establish his authority”. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> he realized operation against police <gloss target="#t_HQ1">HQ</gloss> would be dangerous for population. He asked <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s help in evacuating neighborhood and promised pay damages to innocent victims. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he explained gravity situation to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and had in particular warned him such action could only lead to civil war. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would not listen to any word of wisdom or friendly advice. He concluded that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is on verge of megalomania. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he and I would have to take urgent decisions since <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s plan, if carried out, would lead to catastrophe and civil war.</p>
<p>2. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> showed me on highly confidential basis memorandum of conversation between <persName corresp="#p_GGLCF1">General Gambiez</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> General <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName>. It appeared, according to memorandum of conversation, <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName> had said <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> troop integration was meaningless, that both he and <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Trinh Minh The</persName> remained unalterably opposed to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, and had asked French for arms with which forcibly overthrow government. Candidate proposed to supplant <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was <persName corresp="#p_TVH1">Tran Van Huu</persName>. I commented to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName> would undoubtedly say anything to anyone for personal gain. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that was true and conversation with <persName corresp="#p_GGLCF1">Gambiez</persName> demonstrated how little troop integration meant.</p>
<p>3. I proposed that we meet April 2 to continue discussion. Meanwhile, I outlined for <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> my thinking under following headings:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) What <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would do if left to own devices: I said I believed <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would attack National Police <gloss target="#t_HQ1">HQ</gloss> and other Binh Xuyen strongholds in city. I believed he could take police <gloss target="#t_HQ1">HQ</gloss> and also Binh Xuyen <gloss target="#t_HQ1">HQ</gloss> if attack were properly carried out. However, we had reports that police <gloss target="#t_HQ1">HQ</gloss> was mined and Binh Xuyen would probably blow up on withdrawing. I was certain <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was determined to relieve <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> quickly on grounds that otherwise government would lose all prestige.</item>
<item>(b) What <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> ought to do: I said I believed <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should relieve <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> immediately, and that was where <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and I differed. I said I felt <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> must do so if he was to remain as head of government. However, I believed that in next two or three days he should announce appointment of new Police Chief, saying no government can tolerate having head of its police member of a rebel band. I told <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> it was my firm conviction <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should do this and I believed that such would be view of US Government, although I had no instructions. I added that I hoped <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would say he had no intention of <pb xml:id="pg_182" n="182" facs="0212"/>attacking police <gloss target="#t_HQ1">HQ</gloss>, and that he was determined to avoid bloodshed. He should call on Binh Xuyen to withdraw from police <gloss target="#t_HQ1">HQ</gloss>, establish new Police Chief in new <gloss target="#t_HQ1">HQ</gloss>, and announce that National Police and Sûreté were to obey latter’s orders. I added that I hoped <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and I could agree promptly to complete our study on sect troop demobilization. On basis of that study <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could refer to his integration of <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> and Hoa Hao forces, and perhaps announce his intention to integrate more Hoa Hao troops plus token Binh Xuyen units. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should add in his announcement that he would give severance pay to demobilized troops and amnesty to <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName> and other rebels on condition that they surrender their arms. He could announce additionally that he intended to assist those sect forces not integrated in National Army establish selves in civil life. He could say that he had appointed, as he says he has done, Foreign Minister to study plan for government reorganization and reconstitution of Cabinet. He could say he was prepared to establish Council of Elders and would be willing to invite specific list of men participate in government. I added that he might not agree to take last step, but <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and I could urge that he do it. Perhaps also <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could also announce creation of an economic council.</item>
<item>(c) My analysis of French position: I told <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> that speaking as friend and hoping to be constructive, I had following analysis to offer of French position in present crisis. I understood French had divided city into defense zones, some controlled by Vietnamese and some by French. I had had reports that <persName corresp="#p_JGPE1">General Jacquot</persName> gave orders to Vietnamese army night 29–30 March preventing troop movement through certain areas. Fortunately army handled itself well and effectively. If army however had failed to stand up to rebels and <persName corresp="#p_JGPE1">Jacquot</persName> had prevented its free movement, he would have assumed a profound responsibility in a country supposed to be free. (<persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> interrupted to say he would like details as to how <persName corresp="#p_JGPE1">Jacquot</persName> had interfered. I said that we had Vietnamese reports to that effect, but I did not pretend to know whether they were true. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said reports were quite false.) I continued that if <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> were determined to prevent further fighting in city, French must come up quickly with positive solution. I added that I was speaking only of crisis within city and not referring to rebel activity in provinces. I said that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> had remarked 31st that if necessary to preserve order he would arrest <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. I added I had not taken this threat seriously, later had wondered what he intended. I said that before any such drastic action was taken <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> should arrest <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName>. If he undertook to arrest <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that would mean complete divergence of French-U.S. policies in Vietnam. I added that owing to reputation of <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> in U.S. it could never be satisfactorily explained why French had determined to support <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> against <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. In order to avoid any such development, I said <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> should agree to immediate replacement of <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> as National Police Chief, under conditions indicated above, and that if he did so I would back his position fully. I said <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> attached great psychological importance to police <gloss target="#t_HQ1">HQ</gloss> building and I did not believe he could be persuaded from attacking it short of <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s agreeing to compromise outlined above.</item>
</list>
<pb xml:id="pg_183" n="183" facs="0213"/>
<p>4. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said with reference to arresting <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> he had merely been dramatizing his intention avoid disorder at all costs. He said, however, that if we decided avoid conflict we must have specific plan to prevent an explosion, threat of which was imminent. I agreed. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that all French had done during period of hostilities was to offer advice within framework of accord under which <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> agreed accept <persName corresp="#p_GGLCF1">General Gambiez</persName> as mediator. As matter of fact, French did intervene to prevent Binh Xuyen from moving into sites previously occupied by National Army, and <persName corresp="#p_JGPE1">Jacquot</persName> had advised National Army troops with respect to proper use of their equipment and how to capitalize on their defensive positions. I told <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> that I had not evaluated reports of French interference, but knew they were believed in certain National Army quarters. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that rumors were inevitable in view of his special responsibilities and asked what I would have done in his place. I expressed sympathy for his position and that of <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>.</p>
<p>5. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said principal requirement in military field at the moment was to avoid any accidental explosion. He believed political question far more important at present and said opposing sides must be brought at all costs to accept principle of negotiation. I told <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> we could not hope to solve problem at that meeting and proposed he sleep on my suggestion. I said perhaps he might have a better plan, but I felt that any plan must include agreement that <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> be relieved as National Police Chief. I said I felt also that French must make sure that <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> not take action in reprisal for <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName>’s removal. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that I must not think he could give orders to <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName>, since latter is not in French pay. I replied <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> was in effect giving orders to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> when he established defense zones in city and prevented movement National Army troops through them. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said this resulted from agreement between Vietnamese and French. I said agreement was between ex-Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> and French, and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would probably not now agree to it. I asked why French should not make similar agreement with <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said indignantly that <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> was as much a rebel for him as for the government. I said if he would agree <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> should leave at once and would promise full backing to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> against rebels that would make all the difference to Prime Minister. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that although <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> appears not recognize it, South Vietnam is in a revolutionary situation. He said he believed relief of <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> would have same effect as storming police <gloss target="#t_HQ1">HQ</gloss>. He said he could arrest <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> in four hours with <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>, but other Binh Xuyen would simply go underground. I commented that in my view <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> was ringleader of sect front. Some French have said they wished we had a Magsaysay here.<note n="2" xml:id="d91fn2">Ramon Magsaysay, President of the Republic of the Philippines.</note> I said Magsaysay would take vigorous <pb xml:id="pg_184" n="184" facs="0214"/>action against <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> and Binh Xuyen. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that there is no strong man like Magsaysay here. I continued saying that if National Army with self-propelled artillery and armored cars could not destroy police <gloss target="#t_HQ1">HQ</gloss>, army had no chance of standing up to Viet Minh. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said this was not the problem; army could take police <gloss target="#t_HQ1">HQ</gloss> at any time. Crucial point is that government does not have sufficient forces to crush rebels everywhere and within short period. Rebels untouched by government would form nucleus of opposing force to conduct civil war, as result of which South Vietnam would be lost.</p>
<p>6. I said that if we reached no solution acceptable to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> he might order attack on police <gloss target="#t_HQ1">HQ</gloss> at any time. Accordingly, we must accept risk at some point. I further cautioned <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> always to act so that French would not be accused of siding against government. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> remarked with some emphasis if it had not been for him, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would have been finished last August. I said I had reports that French were restricting issue of gasoline to National Army. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> exploded at that point, saying tickets previously valid for issue of gasoline had been cancelled because National Army officers had sold quantities of them to Binh Xuyen. He said that Vietnamese General Staff had been issued any and all amounts of gasoline requested without question. He added that Vietnamese implored French retain control of tank farms because they feared otherwise Binh Xuyen would blow them up.</p>
<p>7. We parted with agreement to meet again morning April 2 to consider my proposals or any French plan which might be developed over night.</p>

<p>1. I met with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> morning April 2 to continue discussion reported ref <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he desired present complete picture of situation <pb xml:id="pg_185" n="185" facs="0215"/>as it appears to him and outline measures he feels must be taken in immediately ensuing days. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that in conversation April 1, I had raised two questions:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) Possible replacement of National Police Chief and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s threat to attack police headquarters with troops, and</item>
<item>(b) General conditions under which <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> experiment might succeed. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said in his view these questions were closely related and had to be treated together with respect to whatever joint action we might take in future.</item>
</list>
<p>2. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that he believed first of these questions had to be treated immediately. He added that as Commander-in-Chief he believed any continued delay in our arriving at common position as to advice we should give <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in this matter entailed risk of even more acute political crisis and possibly civil war. Unless we reached joint position both with regard to immediate and long range aspects of the problem the worst might happen. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he agreed that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could not long retain <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> as Police Chief, for latter is both a gangster and inefficient. He agreed that we must both back a new policy when appointed but said he was still gravely concerned with question of timing of such appointment. Immediate problem we had to face was what recommendations we should make to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. That is, whether or not we should dissuade him from using force to remove present police chief and install his own man. <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> might answer force with force and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s and our trouble thereby would multiply enormously. Even if Binh Xuyen did not respond with show of violence, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> continued, there would be in effect two police establishments between which clashes would be inevitable. Accordingly, this course, even if involving no initial use of force could not really solve problem. Accordingly, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> added, it was his profound conviction that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> cannot now settle problem by arms with means at his disposal and that any attempt on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s part to do so could only aggravate crisis. <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName>, he said, is protected by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, who might or might not support <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName>’s removal. In any case, a partial solution of overall problem, which dealt only with control of police, would still leave <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> pulling the strings, since it is not to be anticipated, short of a general settlement, that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> will agree to <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName>’s elimination from political scene. I interrupted <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> to ask whether he meant that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> would not approve <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s removing <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> and might advise <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> not to yield to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s order. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> replied that it is hard to say what <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> will do. In any case, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has not the means to defeat <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> so long as latter is assured of some degree of support from <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, even if only “moral.” Moreover, through his ally <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> might be tempted take one last blow at <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. I assured <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> I knew that <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> could not be disposed of easily. However my position remained that unless we came up with <pb xml:id="pg_186" n="186" facs="0216"/>an adequate solution, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had no option but to relieve <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> quickly. Therefore I had proposed that we tell <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> we would support him in removing <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> under certain specific conditions, such as that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> not resort to force unless attacked.</p>
<p>4. [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that in his opinion we could not break present problem down into its component parts but would have to treat crisis as a whole. What, he continued, might be a valid solution to problem of South Viet Nam? He believed such a solution would be to set up a broadened govt capable of honorably representing Vietnamese people, of participating in pre-election discussions with Viet Minh, and of winning elections. He said we must put aside any idea of reaching “an ideal solution. South Viet Nam would have to defend its existence against Viet Minh with available men and means, even at sacrifice of some theoretical principles both on side of Vietnamese and ourselves. No Vietnamese Govt could hope to succeed unless fully supported by France and U.S. He recognized that parliamentary opinion in France and U.S. tends to lag behind realities and said he felt it was our duty to shape such opinion in this instance rather than merely be guided by it.</p>
<p>5. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> went on to say that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s position despite our full support is now much weakened. French public opinion initially was strongly against <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. That had caused <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> grave difficulties which he had managed to overcome only at cost of great effort. However, he had managed to resolve this difficulty and swing full support of <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. He shared my regret fully that experiment so far has not succeeded.</p>
<p>6. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that he could see only two possible solutions. These were:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) Use of force by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. Speaking as <gloss target="#t_CINC1">C-in-C</gloss>, he said, he should reject this solution; nevertheless he was willing to examine it. After mature reflection on the means and time at <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s disposal, he believed that if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> took on sects militarily and by some improbable development were able to defeat them, he would so have exhausted the energy and resources of South Viet Nam that his govt would not have strength left to defeat Viet Minh on political and psychological fronts. Moreover, the govt, assuming it was victorious over sects, might be too weakened to cope with internal disorders created by Viet Minh. He believed National Army less to harry National Army.<note n="4" xml:id="d92fn4">This sentence is printed as written in the source text.</note> Moreover, loyalty of National Army has been shaken, in recent days, by resignation of DefMin <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Minh</persName>. He said that it was unrealistic for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to count upon integration of <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> forces into National Army as an asset in this struggle. In consequence, he believed no solution by force to be practicable.</item>
<item>(b) Political solution. Theoretically, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has full powers and could reform his govt and carry out programs we have helped him <pb xml:id="pg_187" n="187" facs="0217"/>develop. To do that however he would need new men. But new men are not coming forward, not only because of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s dictatorial methods but also because <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has been almost repudiated by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. In absence of a National Assembly, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> must turn to only higher legal authority which is <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>.</item>
</list>
<p>7. Accordingly, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> formally proposed that US and France ask <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> to arbitrate present crisis. He was aware of US opinion regarding <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and was not proposing that latter return to Viet Nam at present In any event, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> is pulling wires. We must insure that he pulls wires as we wish and direct. He said French had no more love for <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> than Americans, but that in present crisis he sees no other solution and urged me give it full consideration. As an initial step he proposed that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> proclaim a 10-day truce. Simultaneously <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> should summon <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, sect chieftains, and certain political leaders such as <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>, to France. In order that proper distinction be made between <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and others, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> proposed that French extend to him formal State invitation. He added that French and American representatives, having first reached full accord, should inform <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> of solutions we wished to reach for each question considered. He added that he was fully cognizant of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s virtues and hoped they could be saved for good of Viet Nam. He urged me to study this proposition at once, adding that to save Viet Nam is an essential policy objective of our two countries. In particular, we have profound responsibility to hundreds of thousands of refugees we have been evacuating from north. Concluding, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> asked pardon for the passion with which he had spoken.</p>
<p>8. I replied that I appreciated the clarity of <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s expression, and while I saw difficulties in his proposal I also recognized its merits. However, I wished to clarify certain issues:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) I said that if possible I would like to see as prior condition that pressure be brought on <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> to support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in removing <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName>. This might result in instructions from <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> authorizing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> discharge <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> and appoint an acting Police Chief. In this connection I said it was vital to avoid any appearance of supporting gangsters against legal govt. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> replied that this might be possible as part of a larger program. However, he fears situation is on verge of explosion and that this might detonate it.</item>
<item>(b) I asked, if <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s proposal were adopted, whether he thought our advice to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> should be communicated through US Embassy and Associated States Ministry in Paris. I said that I believed he and I should not go to France for this purpose, since we are so closely identified with local situation. Further discussion with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and his advisors led to agreement that if proposal is adopted it would be better that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> meet with Vietnamese leaders and sect representatives in Paris rather than Cannes as first suggested, where French influence could be brought to bear more discreetly than in Cannes.</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_188" n="188" facs="0218"/>
<item>(c) I agreed that it would be wise if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, an explosive element at present, were to leave the country for a while and it would be a good device for French to extend State invitation to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, to give him greater prestige than sect leaders in Paris. Meanwhile, [garble] conduct govt discussion of this point led to agreement that best acting <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> would be <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Tran Van Do</persName>. Otherwise, a three-man executive composed of <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName>, [name and title deleted], and Minister for Plan <persName corresp="#p_NVT2">Thoai</persName> might be workable alternative. In either case, delegation of power should be made by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</item>
</list>
<p>9. I pointed out we would have to take steps both with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and Binh Xuyen to prevent further outbreak of hostilities over weekend. We agreed we would see <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> together to urge he accept three-day truce and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> would alone contact sect leaders, beginning with <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName>, to secure their assent to truce. We agreed we would make no reference whatever to possible intervention by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, as described above, and that that proposal, until and unless accepted by our govts, would remain most secret.</p>
<p>10. In conclusion, I reviewed for <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> primary reason US supported <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, despite his most serious inadequacies as an administrator, his present inability to develop executive team work, etc., has been our conviction that the selfless devotion of <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> and his phony religion of Communism could best be met by the leadership, however inadequate from practical standards, of a man of spiritual qualities, high integrity, moral courage, and devoted nationalism, such as <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName>. No other Vietnamese has these qualities to same degree. (However, while I did not say so, I have grave doubts <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will ever be able to work with other able men.)</p>
<p>11. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and I proceeded at once to <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>’s Palace. As agreed, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> presented proposal for three-day truce in order further study of situation and I followed with expression of complete concurrence. We said that our objective was to save the govt and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> himself and to permit him to play his proper and essential role as <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>. At beginning <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was unreceptive, said that <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName>’s men, in addition to terrorism in Saigon, intended seize town of Dalat by force, and asked <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> whether he would accept responsibility for whatever happened during truce period. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and I said that former would do everything possible to prevent conflict. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> agreed in his contact with <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> to seek latter’s agreement that National Police would not act against govt in Saigon or elsewhere. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and I agreed that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should cut off <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName>’s post office telegraphic communications with provinces, and expressed surprise he had not done so already. Finally <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> agreed accept three-day truce on condition, to which we agreed, that civil and military authorities react with all means at their disposal in case of attack by sect or police forces, and that at end of 3-day period he could proceed relieve <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> agreed. (Our basic proposal <pb xml:id="pg_189" n="189" facs="0219"/>provided for this being done by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> reinforced by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s active support. See par 8 (a) above.) <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> undertook report to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> results of his contacts with sects. We proposed that if general agreement was reached, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> announce truce, but without reference to US-French intervention.</p>
<p>12. Recommendations:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) I believe <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s proposal is most promising yet made to escape from present impasse. Moreover, it has advantage of being a French proposal and conferences involved would be held in France. If it should fail it will tend to force French to be more amenable to any alternate plan we might then insist on. Meanwhile it should provide essential breathing spell during which tensions can be relaxed. I feel also that this proposal offers us a means of shifting our policy with respect to support of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s govt, if we conclude that to be necessary, while at the same time maintaining a solid front with France. Accordingly, I recommend Dept accept <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s proposal in principle, subject only him working out details of consultations and specific recommendations to be made to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. I recommend Embassy Paris be instructed to convey to French Govt our acceptance of this proposal, which <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> telegraphed to Paris following our conversation.</item>
<item>(b) Removal of Police Chief <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> as proposed in par 8 (a) above be included as an integral part of this plan.</item>
<item>(c) If plan is adopted, consultations and conferences take place in Paris.</item>
<item>(d) Neither <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> nor I participate in consultations and conferences.</item>
<item>(e) Either <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> or an interim executive council composed of <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName>, [title deleted], and Minister for Plan be named by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to act for him in his absence.</item>
<item>(f) For immediate action, I recommend Dept instruct Embassy Paris <gloss target="#t_niact1">niact</gloss> make joint approach with French to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> asking him call for immediate ten-day truce in Viet Nam, beginning at expiration present three-day truce. If Dept has not completed consideration all elements this message I urge that this step of program be carried out in advance and if necessary without reference to entire plan, which has been reached at govt level. If this step would have to precede others, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> could be told that we are working on solution and require his assistance in order maintain peace during that period.</item>
</list>
<p>13. Your <gloss target="#t_niact1">niact</gloss> 4284 received just as we were finishing this message. I see no reason for changing any of above. Ref your par 4, I hope to forward very shortly program covering both short and long term aspects sect problem. We may well need some additional funds to make this program effective. Greatly appreciate Depts continued support my mission.</p>
<p>14. I have just learned that <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> have agreed truce conditions and <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName>, who has not yet been reached, is expected agree a.m. 3 April.</p>

<p>4309. Saigon’s Tel 4301 repeated Paris 1151, repeated by Department to London as 5052.<note n="2" xml:id="d93fn2"><hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note></p>
<p>1. Our general policy was outlined in Department’s 4284, repeated Paris as 3498.<note n="3" xml:id="d93fn3"><ref target="#d90">Document 90</ref>.</note> we have carefully studied situation outlined <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> and have given full consideration proposal outlined by French and to your views. As much as we wish to follow your recommendations there are certain aspects of the matter which give us cause for concern.</p>
<p>2. What will be effect on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and how will proposal be put to him? <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> may not accept it and it may precipitate his resignation. Even if he did not resign, we might be put in undesirable position of having to persuade him to accede and go to Paris for proposed meeting and for <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s “arbitration”, without <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> or ourselves knowing in advance what sort of solution is envisaged.</p>
<p>That is weakness of proposal at this stage. We don’t know what meeting supposed to accomplish or what French consider is the nature of the accord they expect us to reach and which will be <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s basis for talks. To accept <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s proposal is to commit ourselves to unknown proposition and uncertain results. Until we have some idea what solution is envisaged we should not blindly commit ourselves to approving such a meeting. If purpose were clear, it might be something else. <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> you and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> have something in mind like para 3b of your 4292<note n="4" xml:id="d93fn4"><ref target="#d91">Document 91</ref>.</note> to propose to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>? Or does <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> have something else: What will French Government propose?</p>
<p>On basis <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s outline, it appears to us <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> would call the tune at any such meeting. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would be outnumbered. French have now in effect withdrawn their support, for continuing with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> (Paris 4285 to Department<note n="5" xml:id="d93fn5">In this telegram, April 2, the Embassy transmitted a note from the French Government giving extensive reasons for its decision to withdraw support from the “<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> experiment” and stating in the final paragraph that “the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Govt must without delay become more widely based or give way to another.” In telegram 4281 from Paris, also April 2, <persName corresp="#p_ATC1">Achilles</persName> reported on a discussion with LaForest in which the French Minister told the Chargé “in blunt and forceful terms” that “the time had come to consider alternative solutions” to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. (Both Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/4–255)</note>). They hold whip-hand <pb xml:id="pg_191" n="191" facs="0221"/>in Saigon by logistic support for national army. <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> and Binh Xuyen position remains intact and their challenge to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and central authority has netted them important and enhanced role with <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> at Paris conclave. French can hardly be expected exert preponderant pressure on <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and Sect leaders in favor of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> which they have conspicuously failed to do during past week. They noticeably refuse refer to Binh Xuyen action as that of defiance, which to us is crucial issue to deal with.</p>
<p>3. We regret there may be real differences between United States and French on approach and tactics re <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, Binh Xuyen, and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. Unless and until these can be smoothed out, we see no benefits but rather possible harm in Paris conclave. Basic issue is whether French at all levels in Saigon will unequivocally let <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> and Binh Xuyen know France and United States support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and national government and its national objectives. In addition to clarifications requested in para 1, we need to know where we stand with French re Binh Xuyen.</p>
<p>4. As for démarche to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> on 10 day or 15 day truce as distinct from a meeting called by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> we would prefer to receive above clarifications, and Embassy’s own general evaluation of situation, before committing ourselves to a truce.</p>
<p>5. In place of <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> proposal, we would prefer adopt a formula which attempted resolve matters in Saigon and involved neither: (a) <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s departure from Saigon, (b) his meeting on equal plane with rebel gangsters, notwithstanding attempt at glossing through device of official French State visit and (c) key role for <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. It would seem more in keeping for French to propose <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> summon <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> to Cannes or Paris to take away police powers, if <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s intervention is actually needed in this matter.</p>
<p>6. We tentatively propose for your comment following suggestions meet situation:</p>
<list>
<item>a) United States and France make clear again we are fully backing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> on condition he immediately announces broad program settle crisis;</item>
<item>b) His program could include items listed para 3b <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ 4292 to Department especially (1) government reorganization and cabinet reconstitution (2) integration necessary number sect troops particularly <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> and Hoa Hao into national army, satisfactory severance pay, amnesty, and assistance in civilian resettlement for those not integrated, (3) special treatment (secret funds, material benefits etc.) for sect leaders, (4) government’s control of national police, (5) effort should be made distinguish between and deal differently with Binh Xuyen on one hand, and two religious sects on the other and removal of Binh Xuyen from any police or other powers, (6) reaffirmation national reform program particularly provisional national assembly, and (7) such other institutions as council of elders as might be helpful without compromising <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s position or governmental operations. <pb xml:id="pg_192" n="192" facs="0222"/>Members should not in our view include <persName corresp="#p_NVT1">Tam</persName>, Num or Buu Hoi.</item>
<item>c) United States and France should agree national government free take such measures it deems necessary against Binh Xuyen to protect integrity and legitimate functions of government. If Binh Xuyen resort to arms or terrorism or reject an attempt at peaceful settlement, French would have to assure <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> they would not restrict national army as at present. It also should be made clear to sect leaders United States will not continue present large-scale financial support for Government Vietnam if sects force out <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and set up new regime.</item>
<item>d) Cease-fire period during which <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>, or some other source, would assist government try settle crisis peacefully with <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> and Hoa Hao in particular.</item>
<item>e) United States and France together obtain <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s support to this program, by any means as might be necessary.</item>
</list>
<p>7. Unless some understanding can be worked out with French, they should know that we will be compelled reconsider United States policy support Vietnam. We cannot envisage any person, aside from <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, who could justify United States financial and other support on scale large enough have even reasonable chance of success. Present French tendency of neutralizing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, weakening and freezing his position, in effect, writing him off, and leaving Binh Xuyen intact or even in stronger position makes it even more difficult than ever for United States to carry on in Vietnam. If Binh Xuyen challenge is allowed to stand, there will be no government under <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> or anyone that we can support, and that can command respect or conduct urgently needed program in face of Viet Minh threat and problem of elections. Problem of other two sects might be worked out gradually, and we much prefer to work out matters along lines of my 4284 to you.</p>
<p>8. We feel that in the present circumstances a course of action more profitable for the United States, France and the Free World could be found than that put forward by the French. Basically we consider that French and United States policy should be to help <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> clear up his difficulty with the Binh Xuyen by strengthening him and by withholding any French support to this gangster mob. Once <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has established his authority over the National Police, which is a right inherent in his position and, as we assess it, within his capability if the French give the logistic and moral<note n="6" xml:id="d93fn6">The words “logistic and moral” were added by a different typewriter. Apparently they are <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ revision.</note> support we feel they should, then his problems with the religious sects could be worked out.</p>

<p>3507. In conversation late Sunday afternoon with French Ambassador regarding <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> proposal<note n="2" xml:id="d94fn2">See <ref target="#d92">Document 92</ref>.</note> on Vietnam problem, Secretary made following points:</p>
<p>1. This is very complicated situation and difficult know exactly what to do. However, we doubt calling Vietnamese together in Paris is good solution.</p>
<p>2. Binh Xuyen challenge to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> strikes at fundamental issue authority any government in Vietnam. Arbitration by patron this gangster outfit would not be conducive acceptable solution.</p>
<p>3. Binh Xuyen should be treated differently from other two groups for it is not a religious organization with some popular support. Other two can be negotiated with over period of time on reasonable basis as they may have some surviving political future.</p>
<p>4. French Government should allow <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to reestablish his authority and should not restrict his means do this. Difference in United States and French policies is that we believe he should be allowed to do this whereas French are afraid this might lead to wide conflict. If they assure <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> moral and logistic support, challenge from Binh Xuyen might evaporate or be contained.</p>
<p>5. If this should work out, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s impaired authority would be somewhat improved. We would be prepared exert pressure on him strengthen his administration to bring in elements he cannot govern without. But we do not see we have to go to Paris for this, since we both can exert, with our respective resources, more influence in Saigon, once central authority established.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_194" n="194" facs="0224"/>
<p>6. We would be surprised if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would accept bid to go to Paris and have <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> arbitrate between him and sect leaders, particularly Binh Xuyen. If his authority is successfully challenged, and he is immobilized, then no government will be able operate in Vietnam and whole structure may collapse. United States aid of some $300 to 400 million is involved in this matter. We do not anticipate any results of Paris meeting with <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> that would justify continuing such large-scale expenditures.</p>
<p>Propaganda effects would also be bad in Asia for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to be summoned to Paris by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> for conclave with gangster rebels and sect leaders defying him.</p>

<p>3510. Embassy Paris telephoned Department morning 4th reporting receipt Department telegram 3506 repeated Saigon 4309<note n="2" xml:id="d95fn2"><ref target="#d93">Document 93</ref>.</note> and that Embassy had just conveyed substance to French. They prepared consider our position.</p>
<p>However in interim French wished U.S. agree today on <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s recommendation that we and French jointly request <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> to immediately instruct <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and Sects that truce should be extended 48 hours beyond present limit.</p>
<p>After fullest consideration Department and on Secretary’s instructions decided we would not go along with request to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. Instead <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> instructed see <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> soonest alone and inform him U.S. convinced any restraint against <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> taking action against Binh Xuyen should be dependent only upon proper conditions to ensure success of such an act.</p>
<p>Accordingly we have informed French we feel strongly that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should be permitted exercise this right and that U.S. and French should support him in such an act both morally and logistically. Also Binh Xuyen should understand U.S. and France completely backing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and withhold any support Binh Xuyen including logistical <pb xml:id="pg_195" n="195" facs="0225"/>support. This position of U.S. and French should be widely published and understood.</p>
<p>We have not yet been able secure French approval to position outlined above and during interim pending French reply we strongly recommend to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that he agree to an extension of 48 hours, so U.S. can have time work out details with French along above lines. Think in his interest well as ours gain this time for coordinated position.</p>
<p>This delay from point view U.S. would not in any way detract from fact of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s legal right to take action against Binh Xuyen and to assume control of National Police.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope such a démarche will cause <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> agree to an extension of the truce.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> should after making such statement to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> inform <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> fully, explaining time extension asked for on two grounds:</p>
<list>
<item>1. To allow French time to consider reply Department telegram 3506 and to U.S. position as outlined above.</item>
<item>2. To allow <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> to determine definitely whether or not <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has capability to win an action, now if such called for, against Binh Xuyen under conditions of full U.S. French support of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and of withholding any support from Binh Xuyen. If not now, by when should <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> be able move?</item>
</list>
<p>In telephone call to <persName corresp="#p_ATC1">Achilles</persName> afternoon 4th he was instructed inform French:</p>
<list>
<item>1. We oppose use of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>.</item>
<item>2. We have instructed <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> to see <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> privately and to request in strongest terms U.S. desire for 48 hour extension truce.</item>
<item>3. That <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> will keep <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> fully informed U.S. position.</item>

<p>4330. Eyes only for <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> from Secretary.</p>
<p>“Dear <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Joe</persName>:</p>
<p>I know that you face a very difficult situation. I had assumed that a time would come when there would have to be some sort of a showdown to demonstrate the authority of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. That, I thought, would be the payoff. If he came through, then the future would be relatively clear. If he failed, then that would be that. In this connection, I have always assumed a considerable difference between the two religious sects and the Binh Xuyen, whom I have considered a gangster group, and I have suspected that the higher-ups got a cut in the proceeds of protection of vice in Saigon. It seems to me deplorable that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is not allowed to show his authority in this situation but that there has to be a ‘truce’ between him and the gangster group, which in effect puts them on an equality basis.</p>
<p>The information I get here is that the National Army battalions in Saigon are strong enough and sufficiently loyal to enable <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to assert his authority against Binh Xuyen provided <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has the moral backing of the French and the United States and the logistic backing of the French, who apparently ration out ammunition and gasoline on a very close basis.</p>
<p>I am not surprised that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is suspicious as to what is going on. Might it not be that if he were assured that he would have the opportunity with the indicated backing to assert his authority over the Binh Xuyen he could at the same time be persuaded to deal politically and peacefully with the <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> and the Hoa Hao.</p>
<p>I do not for a moment doubt your analysis of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in that he lacks many desirable qualities. On the other hand, I thought we felt when I was in Saigon that the decision to back <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had gone to the point of no return and that either he had to succeed or else the whole business would be a failure.</p>
<p>So long as he feels that he is likely at any moment to be regarded as expendable by the French and replaced, then I can understand that his natural disposition to be suspicious and not to delegate responsibility assumes an exaggerated form.</p>
<p>I really think that we should make a strong issue with the French on getting their backing to his asserting his authority as <pb xml:id="pg_197" n="197" facs="0227"/>against the Binh Xuyen either now, if his strength is probably enough, or later in the near future if it is felt that his strength can be and needs to be increased in the interval. However, I would suspect delay under present circumstances would decrease rather than increase his prestige and authority and that unless he can act quickly the best moment will have passed.</p>
<p>I have just been talking with the President<note n="2" xml:id="d96fn2"><p><persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> discussed Vietnam among other topics with <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> at 3:30 p.m. on April 4. The following excerpt is from the report by <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> of that conversation:</p>
<p>“2. I discussed generally with the President the situation in Saigon (which I had already discussed with him over the telephone late Sunday [April 3]). The President urged that we should press the French in the strongest way to permit <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to assert his authority as against the Binh Xuyen. He said that if he failed it would be too bad, but it would be better to find out now rather than later whether the National Army on which we were spending so much money was loyal.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> Papers, Meetings with the President)</p>
<p>No memorandum or summary of the April 3 telephone conversation has been found.</p></note> and his mind runs along with mine in the foregoing respects. On the other hand, we realize that we are far away and we both have great confidence in your judgment. Also we both have great personal confidence in <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>. However, one thing which is near at hand is our domestic problem and the practical unlikelihood that Congress will authorize continuing expenditure of funds for a successor to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> who is picked by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> or who has the French imprint.</p>
<p>Faithfully yours, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster</persName>.”</p>

<p>4331. There follows background thinking on <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 4309 to Saigon rptd Paris 3506.<note n="2" xml:id="d97fn2"><ref target="#d93">Document 93</ref>.</note></p>
<p>1. Problem is whether central government with authority can develop in Vietnam. Binh Xuyen challenge must be met head on sooner or later and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> must have freedom of action maintain central authority. Question is one of timing. Does he have sufficient resources <pb xml:id="pg_198" n="198" facs="0228"/>and dependable forces on his side now? Would he have more by waiting? But in any event continual temporizing will only serve aggravate critical problem. US Government must know whether there will be government with sufficient authority to support in Vietnam.</p>
<p>2. General policy re <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> does not overlook difficulties and handicaps but is still pinned to inescapable fact no suitable alternative person has yet been proposed or appeared on the scene. In our assessment, any alternate choice or combination, under present circumstances of Binh Xuyen challenge and unsettled sect negotiations, would have far less chance of producing any results with our large-scale support than does present course with all its complex difficulties. Secretary touched on this general point with <persName corresp="#p_CMMJ1">Couve de Murville</persName> Sunday<note n="3" xml:id="d97fn3">April 3.</note> who acknowledged French had no alternative.</p>
<p>3. <persName corresp="#p_CMMJ1">Couve de Murville</persName> informed Secretary French Government had sent telegram Sunday to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> which (a) approved his proposal on Paris meeting and (b) indicated <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s recent message to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was not intended as “blaming” <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> for shooting incident March 30–31 and that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> not hostile to retaining <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_CMMJ1">Couve de Murville</persName> also informed us French proposition includes (1) “committee or Directoire” representing different spiritual and other elements in Vietnamese life, (2) Government under <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> on enlarged basis of technicians which would not distinguish between new men who have not served under French and former men who have, and (3) sects should be used for well-conceived interests or purposes, given territorial responsibilities for struggle against Viet Minh and resettlement of refugees, and paid appropriately for any useful tasks they may perform.</p>
<p>4. In commenting on Secretary’s points (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 4308 Saigon rptd Paris 3507<note n="4" xml:id="d97fn4"><ref target="#d94">Document 94</ref>.</note>) <persName corresp="#p_CMMJ1">Couve de Murville</persName> said he did not have latest information on Binh Xuyen. However he thought basic question was proper evaluation of strength of both sides. He preferred to leave aside question of Binh Xuyen and discuss problem of strengthening <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government. He said he thought <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> did not believe that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could succeed because Vietnamese of stature and ability might no longer serve with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>
<p>5. We realize we and French may take different approaches and have different emphasis because of our different positions in Vietnam. French have less flexible policy and may wish to move cautiously and slowly because they have people, military forces and enterprises in Vietnam which cannot be quickly moved out. On the other hand although our material investment is relatively smaller, we do have a tremendous stake in the future of Vietnam and <gloss>SEA</gloss> from <pb xml:id="pg_199" n="199" facs="0229"/>viewpoint of our national security and prestige. For some respects, therefore, we can be more flexible than the French.</p>
<p>6. Department becoming concerned over press stories that “wide split” is developing between French and Americans over crisis. Saigon may point out to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> and Paris to French authorities that we would deplore such stories. We fully recognize grave and complex problems <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> are facing in Saigon and appreciate great efforts they are making to bring about practicable solution. US and France both are seeking to assist in strengthening of Free Vietnam. Whatever difficulties there may be from time to time on tactics and emphasis, we mean to keep closest touch with French here, Saigon and Paris.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>The Crisis in Saigon</item>
</list>
<p>1. During the night of 29–30 March minor fighting broke out in Saigon between armed members of the Binh Xuyen (the pirate–gangster group which was given control of the National Police and the Sûreté by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>) and elements of the Vietnamese National Army. The French succeeded in establishing a truce which still exists, and have deployed some 20,000 troops in the Saigon area to separate National Army and Binh Xuyen forces. Premier <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> remains determined, however, to take control of the national police, using force if necessary. The crisis in civil order has been heightened by the recent resignations of several members of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s cabinet.</p>
<p>2. In this situation <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> has recommended that US policy in support of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> be reviewed. He points out that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has had ample opportunities to build a government and has failed both to bring in strong cabinet leaders and to delegate authority. He fears that the country will not tolerate <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s “one-man” government and <pb xml:id="pg_200" n="200" facs="0230"/>believes that the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government may shortly fall. He recommends, therefore, that the following alternatives to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> be considered:</p>
<list>
<item>a. A new government with <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Tran Van Do</persName> (present foreign minister) as president;</item>
<item>b. A new government with <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> as president;</item>
<item>c. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> to return in support of a new government to be formed and led by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>;</item>
<item>d. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> to return and assume presidency over a new government.</item>
</list>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> recognizes that the problem of the Sects would remain for a successor, but he fears that if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> remains in office and pressed for military action against the Sects, there will be insubordination in the Army leading to conditions more intolerable than those existing at the time of General <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName>’s insubordination.</p>
<p>3. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s main objectives since assuming office have been to establish the independent character of his government and thus to rally nationalist support and to develop and extend the authority of the National government. The present crisis is an outgrowth of his efforts to break the power of the Sects. Since the first of the year, with firm US and increased French support, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has been making some progress toward this end. As a result of bribes, appeals to Vietnamese nationalism, and the French stopping subsidy payments to the Sects, certain Sect leaders rallied to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> or at least agreed not to oppose him.</p>
<p>4. The Sects appeared to recognize the seriousness of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s threat to their special position and reacted in March by forming a United National Front. The Front presented <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> an ultimatum, demanding that he resign or “reform” his government. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, although agreeing to consider broadening his government reacted to the challenge of the Sects by removing the Saigon–Cholon police from Binh Xuyen control and renewing his efforts to split the Sects. Within the past few days he has succeeded in rallying the second of the two major military leaders of the <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName>, making a total of approximately 15,000 <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> troops now pledged to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. However, the permanence of any single rallié is dubious and probably depends on the amount of his subsidy and his estimate of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s power position.</p>
<p>5. In the present crisis <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> has been unwilling to commit unreserved support to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> and the French have tended to consider the Sects’ action as a part of a struggle for power between two opposing groups rather than as a challenge to a legitimate government. In part, at least, this is in keeping with the general French dislike for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> which they have evidenced from the beginning and their reluctance to turn against the Sects. There is now a <pb xml:id="pg_201" n="201" facs="0231"/>mounting body of evidence that the French in Indochina, and particularly the military, are maneuvering with the Sects to secure the downfall of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d98fn2"><p>A subsequent <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> study, entitled “Reports of French Aid to the Binh Xuyen During the Present Saigon Crisis”, May 5, is attached to a memorandum by Howe to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, May 6. Howe summarized the paper as follows:</p>
<p>“Almost all of the available evidence of French aid to anti-government elements, though voluminous, is circumstantial or provided by interested sources and it would not appear that a very firm case of French involvement could be made. Nonetheless, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> concludes that: ‘During the past month, there have been significant indications that French officials in Saigon have not only overtly opposed continuation of the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> administration but have provided covert encouragement and material assistance to the Binh Xuyen.’ ” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> <gloss target="#t_FESEA1">FE/SEA</gloss> Files: Lot 58 D 266, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> Mission, Miscellaneous)</p></note> The French attitude may also result from a French estimate that the Sects are too strong for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to cope with by force and French desire to avoid at almost any cost involvement of French forces in civil war in South Vietnam or any shooting which would endanger French civilians in Saigon. To avoid conflict they have consistently urged <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> not to resort to force against the Sects and have recommended that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s assistance be sought in bringing the two parties together.</p>
<p>6. The Sects are primarily the creation of the French who developed and nurtured them in the course of applying a “divide and rule” policy in Indochina for many years. Most Vietnamese understand the long history of French relations with the Sects. If, therefore, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> resigns or is removed during this crisis, many Vietnamese will almost certainly conclude that the French are still the arbiters of political action in South Vietnam. Many Vietnamese would conclude that efforts to build an independent national authority were futile and Vietnamese nationalism would suffer a severe blow. Moreover, if the National government gives in, the Sects will have confirmed their position as autonomous power centers and thus render even more difficult the formation of an effective central government in South Vietnam. In all probability the Sect leaders who have rallied to the central government would withdraw and seek to reestablish their autonomous position.</p>
<p>7. In this situation, it would be extremely difficult for a successor, who would almost inevitably be labelled a French puppet, to rally genuine national support. If a successor attempted to follow <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s example of building national authority, he would soon be up against the same problem with the Sects and other special groups who, having won the first round, would be even more vigorous in their efforts to protect their position. South Vietnam divided between the Sects and a weakened national government would have little chance of survival against Viet Minh infiltration, let alone winning any election.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_202" n="202" facs="0232"/>
<p>8. <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Tran Van Do</persName>, the present foreign minister, is a weak person, of doubtful personal courage, and has little political following. <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>, while a capable person, is a Tonkinese without substantial support in South Vietnam. The return of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, under any condition, would probably not lead to effective government. We believe his prestige is low and because of his association with the French he would not have nationalist support. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> himself has shown none of the attributes of a leader who would be capable of dealing with the difficult immediate problems in Saigon nor has he demonstrated the necessary endurance to provide sustained leadership for the future.</p>
<p>9. The loyalties and capabilities of the Vietnamese army in this situation are not clear. The units in the Saigon area are commanded by officers selected by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, and some French and US sources believe that they would remain loyal to him in the event of fighting with the Binh Xuyen. However, these units have no ammunition reserves and are dependent on the French for resupply. We agree with <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> that there is some danger, that, if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> uses force against the Sects, there may be some insubordination in the Army. However, we also feel that both the Binh Xuyen and Hao Hoa [<hi rend="italic">Hoa Hao</hi>] troops are not highly motivated, and would not long resist determined force. On balance, we believe that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would have the capability, if given full US and French backing, of dealing with the present crisis in Saigon.</p>
<p>10. There is some danger that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> may resign or that his government will fall in the immediate future. Such eventualities would be most likely if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should feel that he was being frustrated in his efforts to reduce Binh Xuyen power by French intervention or lack of US support. If <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should leave office during this crisis he would probably issue a strong statement denouncing the French for intervening in defense of the Sects and the US for withdrawing support of the National Government.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Reply by <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> to Your Cable of 1 April</item>
</list>
<p>The following message from <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> was received . . . on 5 April 1955. It is in reply to the message . . . to <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> on 1 April 1955.<note n="2" xml:id="d99fn2">See the attachment to <ref target="#d89">Document 89</ref>.</note></p>
<p>1. The Vietnamese National Army (<gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss>) now has six battalions in Saigon–Cholon and seven more at the Quang Tre Training Center four kilometers northeast of the city. The latter force includes three battalions of Nung troops whose movement to this area was vigorously protested by the French. Many French officers and non-commissioned officers are in active command positions in Nung battalions. The Nungs are more Chinese than Vietnamese and their use against the sects would be a tragic blunder. We have reports that the Government is planning to bring down three additional National Army battalions from Nha Trang area. Our estimate is that the Government has ample troops now in the Saigon–Cholon area to destroy the Binh Xuyen Headquarters and capture Sûreté Headquarters. To wipe out the Binh Xuyen if the latter then went underground would be a vastly difficult task, however, and would probably lead to civil war.</p>
<p>2. There are estimated to be two Binh Xuyen battalions in Saigon, one at the National Sûreté Headquarters, Rue Catinat, and one dispersed throughout Cholon following the engagement of 30 March. An additional five battalions are just outside the city limits, across the Arroyo Chinois, a narrow creek. On the night of 1 April the “United Front” radio announced that four Hoa Hao battalions had been brought from the western provinces to the outskirts of the city and placed under <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName>’s command. <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> sources say that a few Hoa Hao have been brought in by sampan, but it seems unlikely that the Hoa Hao would venture to send substantial forces. The Hoa Hao are capable of considerable harassment of ferry and road communications in the western provinces.</p>
<p>3. With respect to the reliability of the <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss>, General <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Vy</persName> (believed to be strongly influenced by the French), General <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName>, and some other high ranking officers are strongly opposed to initiating a <pb xml:id="pg_204" n="204" facs="0234"/>major armed showdown at this time. American military officers most familiar with the units in and near the city, however, believe that they are loyal to the Government and would be reliable in combat. The battalion involved in fire-fighting on morning of 30 March was ably commanded and conducted itself effectively.</p>
<p>4. The National Army has superior forces, and with artillery available, which the Binh Xuyen cannot match, could drive the Binh Xuyen from the city. In this event, the Binh Xuyen, after some resistance, would be likely to withdraw into the Delta area and then go south, but would have the capability of effecting considerable destruction in the city during the process as a result not only of fighting and demolitions, but also guerrilla-type actions in Cholon.</p>
<p>5. <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> is highly unpredictable and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, as I have reported during the past few days, appears determined to take over the National Sûreté and the few other police installations in the city now occupied by the Binh Xuyen. The French are deeply concerned over the possibility of fighting in the city. A serious outbreak would generate strong pressures for French intervention with troops, which <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> wishes to avoid. On 30 March, French and <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> agreed on sectors of responsibility for security, under which French now guard some utilities, all bridges (except one of the two important bridges leading south from the city which is now controlled by the Binh Xuyen), and the European section of Saigon. This increases chances of French involvement if hostilities break out.</p>
<p>6. As reported in <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 4292,<note n="3" xml:id="d99fn3"><ref target="#d91">Document 91</ref></note> para. 6, French cancelled some gasoline tickets issued to <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> for March. However, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> told me categorically that tickets were cancelled because <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> officers sold them to Binh Xuyen and that Vietnamese General Staff had received all gasoline requested. New tickets for April have now been issued and <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> General Staff told <persName corresp="#p_OD1">O’Daniel</persName> on 3 April that they were satisfied with arrangements for gasoline supply.</p>
<p>7. As to ammunition, I believe it likely that supply by French to <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> has also been limited, and since the fighting on 30 March, the <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> battalions in this area have only one day’s supply. Within last day or two, further supplies of ammunition have been requested but not yet furnished although they are expected on 4 April. French and <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> sources agree French have offered to turn over ammunition dumps to Vietnamese effective 15 April. <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> is now considering whether it can make available the force, estimated at one battalion, to guard the dumps. One possibility under consideration is use of Hungs [<hi rend="italic">Nungs</hi>?] for this purpose.</p>
<p>8. I think it likely that <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> will continue to encounter some delays in getting matériel and supplies from French, especially if <pb xml:id="pg_205" n="205" facs="0235"/>latter anticipate their use in an attack on Binh Xuyen forces in the city.</p>
<p>9. Neither . . . nor our military attachés have given me any information as to Viet Minh infiltration into the Binh Xuyen or Viet Minh influence in enlarging the present crisis. It may safely be assumed that they will take any possible advantage of the current situation, particularly if fighting breaks out again. Binh Xuyen were allied with Viet Minh before rallying to National Government several years ago. As mercenary troops, they can be expected to have few scruples about a deal with Viet Minh if they feel it is to their advantage.</p>
<p>10. <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> troops are, in my judgment, likely to stand aside from any hostilities in Saigon–Cholon unless accidentally involved. The firmness of their rallying to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has not been clearly established and their leaders have signed agreements and made statements in support of both sides. <persName corresp="#p_GGLCF1">Gambiez</persName> is sure <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> integration is meaningless. (See <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 4292, para. 2.) On the other hand, <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName> is convinced that <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> troops are firmly on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s side. I think it is at present unwise to assume that <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> forces will respond to government orders and will support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in a showdown.</p>
<p>11. Binh Xuyen and Hoa Hao, within their areas of influence in the Baria–Nhabe and western Cochin China regions respectively, will retain, at least for a considerable time, the capability to seriously harass communications and commerce and to prevent the extension of National Government authority.</p>

<p>1. Because of transmission difficulties full text your 4309 did not reach me until 0900 local 5 April. Other references came in later hours same date.</p>
<p>2. I shall answer pertinent points in all above <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>s in this message.</p>
<p>3. Despite fact that para 6 <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 4309 indicates tentative refusal of French proposal contained <gloss target="#t_mytel1">mytel</gloss> 4292,<note n="5" xml:id="d100fn5">The reference may be in error. Telegram 4301 from Saigon, <ref target="#d92">Document 92</ref>, has a clearer exposition of the French proposal than the reference telegram, <ref target="#d91">Document 91</ref>.</note> remainder of 4309 and other <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>s clearly indicate Department disapproval of <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s proposal. This I accept.</p>
<p>4. I must point out dangers of position stated in para 7 <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 4309 “We cannot envisage any person, aside from <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, who could justify U.S. financial and other support on scale large enough have even reasonable chance of success.” I fear if this position is finalized, we will have adopted a rigid position which will allow no room for maneuver in the event that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> either resigns or, despite our support, is relieved by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> or otherwise forced out of the govt. Aside from our security interests, in South Vietnam, we do have a considerable moral obligation to the more than one-half million refugees who have come out of the north, in large part through our aid and encouragement.</p>
<p>5. We apparently have failed to make clear certain points which I will seek now to clarify.</p>
<list>
<item>(a) Possibilities of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> broadening his cabinet.
<list>
<item>(1) One of greatest threats to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s govt now is fact that he is today very nearly running a one-man show with his two brothers <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Luyen</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>, and a few obscure ministers acting as his only Cabinet advisers through our intervention. <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> and his associates remain figuratively in the govt, but they are not consulted with respect to policy, and <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> has stated categorically that he has no influence on the President. It is significant that neither <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> nor any of his Tinh Than associates attended important Cabinet meeting this afternoon (see paragraph 12, following message.<note n="6" xml:id="d100fn6">In telegram 4349 from Saigon, April 6, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> reported in great detail on his efforts to bring about a further extension of the truce. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/4–655)</note>).</item>
<item>(2) Both <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> and [title deleted], with whom I have just talked concerning strengthening govt, state that no new men can be persuaded to enter govt now. Reasons they give for this condition differ, but fact remains that, in my judgment, it will not be possible to induce any able men to join govt unless they can be convinced that President will change his methods of operation, will in truth consult them with respect to policy and will decentralize to them in the execution of details of their offices.</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_207" n="207" facs="0237"/>
<item>(3) At the moment an even stronger reason which will prevent participation of men such as <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> and <persName>Minh</persName> is that they thoroughly disagree with President’s insistence upon use of force in arriving at solution of sect problems. They may be wrong in this reasoning, but fact of their disagreement cannot be challenged.</item></list></item>
<item>(b) Capabilities of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to overthrow Binh Xuyen.</item>
<item>This question covered in detail in message to <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> (Saig 6273) 4 April 1955.<note n="7" xml:id="d100fn7">Apparently a reference to the message from <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> contained in the memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_WFG1">Wisner</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> There is no question in my mind but that <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> Army could drive organized forces of Binh Xuyen from city and forcibly take over Saigon–Cholon Sûreté and Police Headquarters. However, I agree with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName>’s firm conviction that this would not prevent attempts of assassination and other sporadic acts of terrorism, nor could the army wipe out Binh Xuyen if they went underground, as they have in the past, or joined in guerilla action with Hoa Hao.</item>
<item>(c) Possibilities of treating Binh Xuyen separately from <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and Hoa Hao.</item>
<item>Average Vietnamese citizen has no love for Binh Xuyen, and recognizes them for what they are. Binh Xuyen provides toughest and most ruthless leadership in so-called United Front. It is believed here that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> has been closely affiliated with <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> and probably still is. Unless this relationship could be genuinely broken, through pressure on <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, I doubt that Binh Xuyen can be separated from United Front by negotiation. I do not believe that unity of sect front is genuine or lasting, and it may well be that <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> would not enter civil war against army if latter took vigorous action against Binh Xuyen, particularly if Binh Xuyen leaders could be captured or eliminated. However, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> firmly believes destruction of Binh Xuyen leaders will not result in break up of either Binh Xuyen or United Front. I have not been here long enough to challenge this assessment.</item>
<item>(d) Question of French assistance to Binh Xuyen.</item>
<item>French had equipped Binh Xuyen forces during war to fight against Viet Minh, but I know of no matériel or ammunition assistance, certainly since the beginning of the present tension. It is possible that through individuals in French or Vietnamese Army, Binh Xuyen may have been able to get gasoline but best estimates here are that their supply is quite limited. (For details on weapons see <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 4343.<note n="8" xml:id="d100fn8">In this telegram, April 5, the Embassy reported frequent rumors in Saigon that French officials were supplying sub rosa the Binh Xuyen and other sects with arms. The Embassy knew for a fact that the French had just broken a black market ring of arms sales by Foreign Legionnaires and others. In both cases, the quantity of arms could not be verified. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/4–555)</note>) I am confident <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> would not knowingly tolerate any assistance to Binh Xuyen under any circumstances now.</item>
<item>(e) Possibilities of French military or logistical support of <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> Army action against Binh Xuyen.
<list>
<item>(1) These questions were discussed this morning 5 April with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName>. He again clearly indicated <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> would not <pb xml:id="pg_208" n="208" facs="0238"/>actively participate against Binh Xuyen or other sects. On other hand he informed me <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> Army controls number of ammo dumps now and four or five days ago he offered to turn over to army an ammo depot in Saigon if they would assume responsibility for its security. <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> Army, according to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>, replied orally that it did not wish to take over this depot. (President probably knows nothing about this.) <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> insists that in no sense has he or the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> been attempting to curb operations of <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> Army. New gasoline forms were required because many old ones had been reported sold to Binh Xuyen by <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> Army officers. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> says army has ample ammunition to initiate any action they may desire against Binh Xuyen, and if they assume control of the Phu Tho Depot they should be able to take care of their own ammo supply.</item>
<item>(2) Reference “basic issue” in para 3 <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 4309. I am convinced <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> has no sympathy whatever for Binh Xuyen. He has agreed that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> must replace Police Chief <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> and assume control of National Police and Sûreté at time or under conditions which would be unlikely to lead to civil disorders. He does strongly feel that timing of this must be carefully weighed, and that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s present intentions will lead to civil war in which <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> is determined not to become involved. I feel sure that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> has instructions to this effect from his government.</item>
</list></item>
<item>6. It appears to me the essential thing now is to secure further extension of truce, if possible. To this end, I took action as reported in next following message.</item>

<p>After we have <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s general acceptance we can proceed inform <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France of this plan which we think only formula which ensures both satisfactory response to Geneva Agreement and at same time plan which is unassailable in intent but probably unacceptable to Communists because of provisions for strict supervision to ensure genuinely free elections. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
<p>You should speak to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> privately regarding elections, without showing him formula outlined next telegram.<note n="4" xml:id="d101fn4"><hi rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note> We are not now attempting secure his approval as such to our position but to assure he understands our viewpoint and accepts it to degree we can proceed with French British on broad assumption Free Viet-Nam’s position similar our own.</p>
<p>Believe best way accomplish this is to remind him of his and foreign minister’s conversations with Secretary on this subject<note n="5" xml:id="d101fn5">See <ref target="#d50">Documents 50</ref> and <ref target="#d51">51</ref>.</note> and to continue that in specific cases of elections in Korea and Germany Free World has stood firm on issue of guarantees of genuine free elections, supervised by body having authority guarantee elements free elections (outlined last paragraph following telegram). In each case Communists have refused accept these safeguards which we think basic and fundamental. We believe unless such guarantees previously agreed upon would be dangerous for Free Viet-Nam be drawn into further discussions other issues of election. Ask <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> if we can assume our thinking is alike on this point.</p>
<p>Since time exceedingly important, hope we can have affirmative answer soonest.</p>

<p>1. US has encouraged and will continue encourage Government Free Vietnam to participate in consultations about elections scheduled for July 1955 by Geneva Accord. US recognizes that Free Vietnam not bound by Geneva Accord, believes it would be beneficial to domestic political strength Free Vietnam and international position of its government if Free Vietnam entered into scheduled negotiations about elections with the Vietminh. US believes Free Vietnam and the Vietminh should be the only principal parties in the negotiations.</p>
<p>2. US believes central question is whether or not Communists will agree to conditions which will allow elections to be a genuinely “free expression of the national will” as called for in the Geneva Agreements. US understands that Free Vietnam will insist on Communist agreement to conditions which will guarantee genuinely free elections. The US fully supports this position. If the Communists will not agree to such conditions the US believes it would be dangerous for Free Vietnam to be drawn into discussion of other questions of detail regarding elections, since fundamental condition for the holding of elections would not have been met, and negotiations on electoral details might tend establish assumption that elections would be held even if the conditions for free elections were not present. US believes that unless conditions for genuinely free elections are established the result could only be fraudulent elections in Communist-controlled North and a resultant Communist victory in elections throughout all Vietnam. None of the Western allies could give approval to fraudulent elections which would result in abandonment of millions of free people to Communist control, including hundreds of thousands who have already left their homes to seek refuge in the South from Communist oppression.</p>
<p>3. US believes that conditions for free elections should be those which <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Sir Anthony Eden</persName> put forward and the three Western powers supported at Berlin in connection with German reunification. US will therefore support Free Vietnam insistence that elections be held in conditions of genuine freedom; that safeguards be agreed to assure this freedom before, after, and during elections; and that any Supervisory <pb xml:id="pg_211" n="211" facs="0241"/>Commission have full powers to act to ensure free elections and to guarantee against prior coercion or subsequent reprisal. Likewise there must be adequate guarantees for, among other things: freedom of movement; freedom of presentation of candidates; immunity of candidates; freedom from arbitrary arrest or victimization; freedom of association and political meetings; freedom of expression for all; freedom of the press, radio, and free circulation of newspapers, etc. . . ;<note n="3" xml:id="d102fn3">Ellipsis in the source text.</note> secrecy of the vote; security of polling stations and ballot boxes. <hi rend="italic">End text</hi>.</p>

<p>4366. 1. Re Saigon’s 4349 repeated Paris 1168,<note n="2" xml:id="d103fn2">See <ref target="#d100fn6">footnote 6, Document 100</ref>.</note> para. 18: Department concurs in recommendation (in which we understand <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> concurs) that US and French Governments “make joint approach to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> to secure his agreement to back <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> fully not only in dismissing <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> but in removing police entirely from Binh Xuyen control”. However Department concurs in this approach to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> on condition that French Government accepts purpose of such intervention in exactly same terms as quoted from <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> above. In addition we believe there should be French-US agreement on time limit for <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> to take the necessary action along the lines of joint recommendation. As far as <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> is concerned, the Department would strongly hope US and French representatives would insist on seeing text of his telegram. In making this joint démarche American representatives should present US position as contained in paragraphs 1 and 3 <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 4284 to Saigon repeated Paris 3498.<note n="3" xml:id="d103fn3"><ref target="#d90">Document 90</ref>.</note> In addition US representatives should inform <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> that we believe <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has inherent right as well as capability reestablish authority of central government over national police. If this is done, conditions would be created which could lead to constructive strengthening of government <pb xml:id="pg_212" n="212" facs="0242"/>under <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and possibly satisfactory adjustment of role and functions of religious sects. But if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s authority is defied and immobilized, then no government will be able to operate in Vietnam and structure may collapse. Mockery will be made of sacrifice and heroism of anti-Communist Vietnamese including refugees. Furthermore contemplated US aid of several hundred million dollars this year could therefore not be justified. Any other points in recent <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss>s which Embassy Paris feels would be persuasive should also be made to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>.</p>
<p>2. As this is matter of grave importance, the Secretary wishes <persName corresp="#p_ATC1">Achilles</persName> make this representation on behalf US in order assure maximum strength and effectiveness of démarche.<note n="4" xml:id="d103fn4"><persName>Dillon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ATC1">Achilles</persName> did this with French officials on the afternoon of April 7 and found, as reported in telegram 4376 from Paris, sent that day, that the French objected to such a démarche on the grounds that any removal of <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> would have to be part of a larger Franco-American request to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> to influence <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to broaden his government and give representation to all factions including the Binh Xuyen. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/4–755)</note></p>
<p>3. French Government officials and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> apparently believe that it is not possible to divide sects in two categories and that therefore the sects should be treated as one and assumed to be united (Paris 4328 repeated Saigon 635<note n="5" xml:id="d103fn5">Dated April 5, not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/4–555)</note> and Saigon’s 4348 repeated Paris 1167,<note n="6" xml:id="d103fn6"><ref target="#d100">Document 100</ref>.</note> para. 5–c). This is fundamental divergence in US and French approach at the time. If our position is valid that religious sects on one hand and Binh Xuyen on other can be treated differently as suggested in general terms in recent <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss>s, Department would like to have soonest from Saigon specific plan of how <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> and Hoa Hao might be neutralized and separated from Binh Xuyen.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of <persName corresp="#p_CLGCP1">General Cabell</persName>’s remarks on the Saigon situation,<note n="3" xml:id="d104fn3"><p>The report of these remarks, made in the course of the discussion of “Significant World Developments Affecting U.S. Security”, reads as follows:</p>
<p>“<persName corresp="#p_CLGCP1">General Cabell</persName> then said he wished to make a few comments on the crisis in Saigon. The seven-day extension of the truce between Premier <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and the sects had postponed for a time the showdown between these opposing forces. The French were obviously not strongly supporting Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_CLGCP1">General Cabell</persName> concluded with an analysis of the relative strength of the National Army and the armies of the three sects.”</p></note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> inquired if the Secretary of State would care to report on these developments.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> described the situation as extremely critical. The French, with the notable exception of <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName>, were obviously eager to see the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government fail and be replaced by a pro-French <pb xml:id="pg_214" n="214" facs="0244"/>regime. Indeed, the French had gone so far as to propose that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> summon <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and the leaders of the sects to Cannes or Paris and there arbitrate the conflict. While the French had now dropped this proposal, it was quite clear that because of the very close tie which existed between <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and the Binh Xuyen gangster group, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s arbitration would have gone against Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. The real problem, of course, was that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> in a sense represented the principle of legitimacy. It would be awfully helpful if someone could “take care” of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. Unfortunately, his proceeds from the Binh Xuyen, who controlled the brothels and gambling houses in Saigon, were so vast that nobody had enough money to bribe him successfully.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> explained that he felt that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should have been permitted by the French to pit his National Army against the sect forces and subdue them. The French, however, had refused to go along with this proposed course of action. The French refusal was the more exasperating inasmuch as the Vientnamese National Army had been developed and designed precisely for the purpose of maintaining internal security and public order, as opposed to resisting overt aggression. If the French refused to permit the National Army to carry out its mission, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, it will be necessary for the United States to reconsider its whole policy toward Free Vietnam. Unfortunately for such a reconsideration, there were no very good alternative policies in sight.</p>

<p>4382. 1. Department deliver to Secretary 8 a.m. local time 7th.</p>
<p>2. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> received me at 1100 7th with no French staff present. He wished to inform me without reservation of results of his reflections on present crisis. He said he had not yet informed his government of views he was about to express. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said our mission here is identical, to save Vietnam for free world and to bar Communist advance in Southeast Asia. He said he viewed this mission as one of exceptional importance and believed no future assignment he or I might have would carry graver responsibility, since we are the “key figures” in present situation.</p>
<p>3. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he and I have been asked to save Vietnam, with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. He said he believes we have done everything possible, even if he for his part may have been maladroit at times. Thus far we had avoided civil war, which would mean loss of Vietnam. He continued saying <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> can no longer be saved except at cost of overcoming enormous difficulties, and if he is saved, we shall have spared for Vietnam the worst Prime Minister it ever had.</p>
<p>4. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> believed <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is entirely isolated save for his family and perhaps a dozen friends. Army has virtually abandoned him; intellectuals are against him; and the masses are not for him, but rather for whoever is willing exert effort to win and hold them. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s prestige has dropped dangerously in provinces, and in army only two or three leaders are loyal to him.</p>
<p>5. The joint approach to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> which we had agreed to recommend to our governments might save <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> temporarily, but latter’s problems would [be] identical. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that for a Nationalist, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is in extraordinary position of being supported only by <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and myself and in consequence is more of a puppet than any of his predecessors. He said he felt deeply it was in interest of Vietnam and free world that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> not be saved. He said on contrary <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> must be rapidly replaced since continued delay can only compromise future of Vietnam. Accordingly, he said, he and I must demonstrate to our governments it is impossible to continue longer on present course and our governments must now ask <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> to remove <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and name a successor.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_216" n="216" facs="0246"/>
<p>6. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> went on to say that in his opinion Vietnam can still be saved, and cited these favorable factors:</p>
<list>
<item>a. Viet Minh are not as active in Vietnam as one might have feared.</item>
<item>b. Economic situation is relatively good, as compared with north.</item>
<item>c. Population is still relatively neutral and can yet be taken in hand.</item>
<item>d. Army contains good raw material that can be whipped into respectable shape in next few months by <gloss target="#t_TRIM1">TRIM</gloss>.</item>
<item>e. The government has in its files excellent plans and reforms, worked out by us, which can be implemented by a new and more efficient government.</item>
</list>
<p>7. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said these favorable elements were reinforced by absolute obligation which French and US have towards refugees, whom they have rescued from north.</p>
<p>8. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he would not pretend <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s record was all bad, and would hope <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> might be included in a future Cabinet. To <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s credit, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> cited relative calm which was maintained after Geneva, services rendered to refugees, and social plans which have been adopted under Prime Minister’s direction. However, he continued, another man is urgently required to carry out major programs and prepare for elections. We should not, he said, say <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> experiment had been a mistake, but rather that his time is now past and choice of a new man is imperative.</p>
<p>9. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said importance he attached to his and my collaboration was such that he had informed me of his conclusions before speaking of them even to his closest associates. He added that day before yesterday he had believed we must continue to support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> but that today, April 7, after a full day of “soul searching” from all angles, he was forced to conclude that in order to save Vietnam for free world, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> must be replaced. He said he realized I would need time to consider his remarks and did not ask for an answer at once.</p>
<p>10. I told <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> I appreciated his sincerity, frankness with which he had spoken, and gravity of his views. I asked if I was to take these views as final. He said that I was so to take them and that they had been arrived at in full consciousness of his civil and military responsibilities. He said he had gathered as much information as he could and had considered problem entirely independently. I said if action was taken along lines he proposed, the first question to consider would be possible successors. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> replied he was prepared to accept anyone but <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, provided new appointee did not mark return to colonialism. He said he had made no specific inquiry of his staff but that he could cite following as possible successors: <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName>, Minister for Plan <persName corresp="#p_NVT2">Thoai</persName>, and former Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName>. I did not discuss this list with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>, who offered it only by way <pb xml:id="pg_217" n="217" facs="0247"/>of example, but did say that my information indicated there might be widespread opposition to <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> as northerner, Dai Viet and persona non grata to sects. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> replied he did not take these objections to <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> very seriously and said everything possible should be done to prevent change of administration from appearing as victory for sects. I said to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> I believed it would be very difficult to prevent any other interpretation by press and public.</p>
<p>11. I told <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> I would have to have time to consider his statement but that I believed I could say Washington might not be willing to give any consideration to replacement of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> until after French-US had brought maximum pressure on <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> to back <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> fully in relieving Binh Xuyen completely of police and sûreté controls. I said in any case this must be done. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he agreed Binh Xuyen could not be allowed continue control police, but he felt this change must be made within framework of a new and general solution. As for our bringing pressure on <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s bringing pressure on Binh Xuyen, it was quite possible that sects might be unresponsive to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and might go underground, possibly even with tacit concurrence of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> commented once more on the anomaly of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s being 12,000 kilometers from scene of action and endowed with authority which he can assert without risk to himself. He added hastily however he did not favor <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s return to Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> went on to say he agreed with me that if government were changed, police control should be changed within overall new framework.</p>
<p>12. I told <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> I would have to report his views to Department but would restrict dissemination of them here. He said he would, of course, report to his own government at once, similarly restricting distribution.</p>
<p>13. I said to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> I could not at once tell him whether I agreed with his position or not. I was inclined to feel we had not gone far enough in our support of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to render such a change acceptable now. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he was certain that we stand on the verge of a grave crisis. He feels uneasy movements of all sorts throughout Vietnam, Communist or “Progressive” inspired.</p>
<p>14. I remarked that if change in government were made that would not get at root of sect problem, and any new Chief would have same difficulties. I analyzed present crisis as arising from fact French had stopped aiding sect suppliers, by agreement with US, and from <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s and our steps to create a single army, and various reforms which threaten sect position and privileges. I added that unless we could agree on solution to sect problem, we would do no more than preserve intact for any new Prime Minister same problems which have beset <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> agreed sect problem must be solved but said it was more vast than my analysis indicated. At present it has <pb xml:id="pg_218" n="218" facs="0248"/>reached state in which personal animosity between <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and sect leaders is such that no compromise between them is possible.</p>
<p>15. I said I believed we had discussed this matter enough for time being. I agreed <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is exceedingly difficult for everyone to do business with. I said I was not sure a change would solve our problem. In any case, if there is change of government, there must be firm agreement between France and US, with agreement of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, enforced if necessary, that our various programs will be completely supported. I suggested <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> quickly complete his study of our current proposal for treating sect problem (Embassy telegram 4373<note n="2" xml:id="d105fn2">As reported in telegram 4373, April 6, the Franco-American working group proposed that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> make a declaration outlining the following plan: integration into the National Army of 10,600 and demobilization of 6,000 <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName>, integration of 7,300 and demobilization of 7,200 Hoa Hao, and integration of 1,500 and demobilization of 4,000 Binh Xuyen; employment of integrated sect troops for security purposes in their territories of influence; and assistance for demobilized sect troops on the same terms as men released from the National Army. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/4–655)</note>) and that we discuss it later in day. He agreed meet with me at 1730.</p>
<p>16. I asked <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> if he thought <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> or another would accept office of Prime Minister. He said he had no doubt of it. While nearly everyone is reluctant to serve under <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, there is no problem about finding people willing to take over top job. I said I was sure <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would not remain in any future Cabinet but would probably withdraw to write a White Paper attacking France and US. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he thought best solution for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would be some kind of “mystic mission” to deal with Vietnamese refugee problem, which is a world problem, at a world level.</p>
<p>17. My personal comments and recommendations will follow, after some further reflection, in special message to Secretary.<note n="3" xml:id="d105fn3"><hi rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note></p>

<p>4399. For Secretary from <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>.</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Secretary:</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_219" n="219" facs="0249"/>
<p>Even before receiving your kind letter (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 4330<note n="2" xml:id="d106fn2"><ref target="#d96">Document 96</ref>.</note>) I had been considering writing you personally as to my estimate of President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s chances of successfully remaining as President of Viet Nam. I have just filed a despatch (<gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 4382<note n="3" xml:id="d106fn3"><hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note>) giving <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName>’s final views on this point. You and the President are entitled to my judgment in light of this and other recent events.</p>
<p>As you know, I have been doing everything within my power to assist <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in accordance with my original directive from the President and subsequent instructions from you and the Department. In various messages, and in my January report, I have indicated my growing doubts as to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s capacity for leadership under the difficult and complex conditions existing in Viet Nam.</p>
<p>I must say now that my judgment is that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> does not have the capacity to achieve the necessary unity of purpose and action from his people which is essential to prevent this country from falling under Communist control. I say this with great regret, but with firm conviction.</p>
<p>During the five months that I have been here I have come to admire <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> greatly in many ways. He has valuable spiritual qualities, is incorruptible, is a devoted Nationalist, has great tenacity. However, these very qualities, linked with his lack of practical political sense, his inability to compromise, his inherent incapacity to get along with other able men, and his tendency to be suspicious of the motives of anyone who disagrees with him, make him practically incapable of holding this government together. As I have often pointed out, he pays more attention to the advice of his brothers <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Luyen</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> than he does to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> or me. He has consistently failed to decentralize responsibility to his ministers, or to consult with them in advance of reaching important decisions. This has resulted in the resignation of the few able men in his Cabinet who were not “yes men”.</p>
<p>I agree with the appraisal of <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> and of men like Dr. <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> and <persName>Minh</persName>, that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will not succeed in getting any new men of ability to join even a reorganized government. Damaging as the above facts are, perhaps even more serious is the President’s apparent incapacity for creative thinking and planning. At no time since I have been here has he offered to me a single constructive thought of his own volition. All of the progressive programs which we have attributed to him have in fact been developed through the cooperative efforts of <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> and me, and our staffs. I am still not sure whether <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> really grasps the full significance of these programs, or the great difficulties of implementing them. Instead of <pb xml:id="pg_220" n="220" facs="0250"/>sticking to the clear but difficult road leading to the conversion of these paper plans into accomplished facts, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has been ever ready like Don Quixote to dash off on side excursions to tilt with windmills. And while bent on these excursions, whether they be to displace officers of the army whom he regarded as loyal to General <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName>, to take action against <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName>, or to relieve a police chief, he loses all sense of direction toward the essential goals, and it is almost impossible to bring him back to the high road. We have had many such tiltings.</p>
<p>In summary, despite his several fine qualities, it is my considered judgment that the man lacks the personal qualities of leadership and the executive ability successfully to head a government that must compete with the unity of purpose and efficiency of the Viet Minh under <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName>.</p>
<p>In saying this I hasten to add that I do not believe that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is indispensable for the accomplishment of our purposes in Viet Nam, that is, to save the country from Communism. Programs which <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> and I have developed are, I believe, sound and susceptible of accomplishment. But our successors here must have a President and a Cabinet to work with, which to some degree will talk our language and will stick steadfastly to the implementation of these programs.</p>
<p>I believe that <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Tran Van Do</persName> or Dr. <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> could form and successfully head such a government.</p>
<p>If our government should accept such a change, I would urge that we stipulate as a prior condition the removal, by President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> with the complete support of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, of the control of the National Police and Sûreté from the Binh Xuyen. You may feel that if this is done, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should be given further time to see whether he can broaden his government and speed up progress. I believe it would be better not to wait. By having saved a certain amount of face for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> by the transfer of police powers from the Binh Xuyen we should then accede to the appointment of <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> as President of the country.</p>
<p>I feel it better not further to lengthen this letter by outlining the successive steps which I would recommend be followed in order to constitute a new government and settle the short and long term problems of the sects. I shall be prepared to submit such recommendations promptly, if you so desire.<note n="4" xml:id="d106fn4">See <ref target="#d108">Document 108</ref>.</note></p>
<p>I fully appreciate gravity of the recommendations I have made above. I need not tell you with what a heavy heart I file this message. However, it is by no means with a feeling of defeat for our objective here. I still feel that under proper native leadership, which can <pb xml:id="pg_221" n="221" facs="0251"/>be had, the programs which we have initiated can still be made effective and can save Viet Nam from Communism.</p>
<p>Faithfully, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Joe Collins</persName></p>

<list type="subject">
<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Situation in Free Viet-Nam.</item>
</list>
<p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> read <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName>’ 4382 and 4399.<note n="2" xml:id="d107fn2"><ref target="#d105">Document 105</ref> and <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> I summarized orally Paris’ 4376.<note n="3" xml:id="d107fn3">See <ref target="#d103fn4">footnote 4, Document 103</ref>.</note></p>
<p>The Senator’s reaction to these telegrams was as follows:</p>
<list>
<item>1. The US should stick to its guns in continuing to support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. He is the truly nationalist leader in Free Viet-Nam who has any chance of saving Free Viet-Nam. That chance is small much less than the 50/50 figure that <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> was giving when he was here in Washington. But the importance of Southeast Asia is so high and our stake is so great that we must take even that chance.</item>
<item>2. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> are the only two national leaders in Viet-Nam. To eliminate <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will leave the field to <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has a lot of support in Central Viet-Nam and even in the southern part. We cannot ignore over a half million refugees who probably know of and support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</item>
<item>3. Dropping <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> now would probably lead to chaos and disintegration. The Binh Xuyen would clearly be on top if we drop <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. The French are not to be trusted in any event. The Cao Dai and the Hoa Hao are self-interested. <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> and his gang are totally unreliable. The issue with them has to be met head on sooner or later. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has demonstrated that he understands this problem and will meet it. The French have stopped him. Even the second truce is probably undesirable. The government should be free to take care of the Binh Xuyen challenge or go down—this government or any government would face the same problem.</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_222" n="222" facs="0252"/>
<item>4. If we drop <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> now, it will have a very bad wide-spread effect on United States prestige in Asia. It will also hurt Viet-Nam and the cause of free nationalism at the Bandung Conference.<note n="4" xml:id="d107fn4">The Conference of Asian and African States at Bandung, Indonesia, April 18–24, 1955.</note></item>
<item>5. If we stick to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, even though it may mean difficulty with the French, the President or the Secretary should make a public statement just as soon as possible clarifying our position.</item>
</list>
<p>The Senator said he could be wrong in his analysis but he still saw no new evidence to change his view. He had read these telegrams and the ones a week ago from <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>. Nevertheless, he still felt we had no alternative. But he expressed himself strongly that if we continue our present policy in Free Viet-Nam we should support it vigorously and publicly to get the maximum benefit from it and to prevent any confusion as to where we stand. This will be important in Asia. We have nothing to be ashamed of in supporting <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in the past or in the future. But it should be clear to all why and to what extent we are supporting <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>

<p>4448. For Secretary from <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>. Department telegrams 4411<note n="2" xml:id="d108fn2">In this telegram, April 8, the Department requested <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ recommendations for establishing a new government in South Vietnam and solving the long- and short-term problems of the sects. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/4–755)</note> and 4412.<note n="3" xml:id="d108fn3">In addition to general recommendations, the Department requested in this telegram, also dated April 8, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ views on the following: a) local French reaction to military action by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> against the Binh Xuyen; b) <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s and local Vietnamese response to his removal by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>; c) potential transferability of the loyalty of the National Army to a successor; d) an assessment of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s political assets among the Catholic community, the refugees, and grass-roots nationalists, as well as in <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s home area, Central Vietnam; e) the Viet Minh reaction to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s removal; and f) the mechanics of removal and the public explanation for such an abrupt change in U.S. policy. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/4–455)</note> This message in two parts. Part I follows.</p>
<p>Part I. Successive steps recommended as follows:</p>
<p>1. Transfer National Police and Sûreté from Binh Xuyen. Two possible methods of doing this depending on whether objective is to <pb xml:id="pg_223" n="223" facs="0253"/>save face for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> or Binh Xuyen, point about latter being to secure their peaceful cooperation with new government.</p>
<list>
<item>a. To make it easier for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to resign and prevent Binh Xuyen from claiming victory in present crisis, we would insist, as prior condition, on transfer of police to government, by ordinance issued by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, but openly supported by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and possibly French and U.S. Public support by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> probably essential to avoid further bloodshed. In this case Binh Xuyen might be forced to bow but might try to sabotage new government in variety of ways. (I should note that French will oppose this step. Although he once favored it, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> has now said he could not agree to it. French fear bloodshed if Binh Xuyen lose control of police under <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and believe new Prime Minister should have political advantage of regaining control of police for government.)</item>
<item>b. In order induce cooperation of Binh Xuyen with new government, it might be advisable to offer <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> a chance to save face by his “voluntarily” proposing that control of police be transferred to new government. I have just had conversation with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName>. Without indicating our possible thinking, I asked <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> if he thought <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> might relinquish police controls to any new government. <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> said he felt that with proper approach, this might well be possible. He insists it would not be possible for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to achieve this. <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> fully agrees that any new government would have to take over police controls, but feels strongly that everything possible should be done to secure cooperation of Binh Xuyen with new government. I believe that if <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> were convinced ahead of time that U.S., France, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and any new Premier would insist on government taking over police, he might well agree to make this offer himself. I believe this method preferable to 1a. above unless Washington feels <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s prestige and perhaps our own must be protected by following method 1a.</item>
</list>
<p>2. Persuade <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to resign, or if he refuses, have <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> relieve him.</p>
<list>
<item>a. Better solution would be resignation by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. If method 1a. above is followed, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could bow out somewhat gracefully “in order to heal the wounds” caused by recent events. We could possibly draft a statement for him.</item>
<item>b. Distasteful as it would be to use <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will not resign, I see no other legal method of replacing him.</item>
<item>c. For timing as to notification of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, see paragraph 3f. below.</item>
</list>
<p>3. Choose successor to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> as President of Council.</p>
<list>
<item>a. I believe it is most important to place on French the onus and responsibility of designating <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s successor. French are all too ready to place onus <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s lack of success on U.S. It would be preferable therefore for the head of new government to be proposed by French and concurred in by the U.S. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> indicated that he would favor <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> or perhaps even ex-Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName>. He stipulated as primary requisite that any new government must avoid taint of colonialism. Hence I believe that if <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s advice were followed <pb xml:id="pg_224" n="224" facs="0254"/>French Government would not propose Buu Hoi, <persName corresp="#p_NVT1">Tam</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_TVH1">Huu</persName>. Our opposition these men has been made clear to French.</item>
<item>b. See my telegram 4263<note n="4" xml:id="d108fn4"><ref target="#d84">Document 84</ref>.</note> for discussion of possible successors. Of course, we would have to come to agreement with the French on a successor and I would now recommend either <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>.</item>
<item>c. After France and U.S. have agreed on a man, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s consent must then be obtained. This would have to be done through Paris.</item>
<item>d. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> would then summon the nominee to Paris for consultation. If possible, this should be done secretly. If <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> were the choice, it might be done without a leak since he has made a couple of trips to Paris within the past year.</item>
<item>e. Assuming nominee would accept task of forming government, he would have to return at once to Saigon for consultations. These consultations should commence with discussions with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and me, who would inform him as to nature of programs which U.S. and France would support. Armed with this knowledge, he could then proceed with conversations with prospective ministers, representatives of various political parties, and leaders of the sects.</item>
<item>f. I feel that as soon as nominee has accepted, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should be invited by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> to resign or else be relieved. Under no circumstances should <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> be told of plan before French and U.S. have approached <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and gained his assent; to inform him could give him damaging material for his “White Paper”. Effort should be made by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> to have <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> remain in office until his successor is prepared to take over. If he should refuse to do this, which is wholly possible, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> would then have to designate, preferably from present Cabinet, someone to act as interim President of the Council. Unquestionably, as soon as <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> receives such notification, he will call on me to find out what information I have and perhaps to ask for advice. I would propose replying that I had been notified by my government of decision of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, and would seek to persuade <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to remain in office until his successor could take over. We should be willing to assist him in preparing a statement which he might issue as indicated in paragraph 2a. above.</item>
</list>
<p>4. Reach agreement between U.S., France, and new President on program for solution of sect political and military problems. It is believed that an agreement would have to be reached between <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>, the new President, and myself, on a program for solution of the political and military problems of the sects. This would require a prior agreement between French and U.S. Governments along the lines of our proposals contained in Embassy telegram 4373.<note n="5" xml:id="d108fn5">See <ref target="#d105fn2">footnote 2, Document 105</ref>.</note> These proposals are being actively studied now by <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName>’s staff. We expect to come to agreement here within 48 hours. Approval will still be required from Washington, particularly as to added costs which are involved in the induction of more sect personnel than originally contemplated, severance pay for sect personnel to be demobilized, and larger average <pb xml:id="pg_225" n="225" facs="0255"/>strength of armed forces for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955, caused by slow-down in discharge of Vietnamese army personnel as a result of present sect crisis.</p>
<p>5. Obtain agreement of sects to proposed solution of their problems.</p>
<list>
<item>a. Next step would probably be for new President to meet with leaders of sects and obtain their agreement to solution arrived at under paragraph 4 above. He would have to make clear to sects that this was best program they could possibly obtain and that it was only way to continue American and French financial and moral support, without which the country could not possibly be saved from Viet Minh and Communism which sects profess to detest.</item>
<item>b. It is our thought that sects would not be invited to participate in Cabinet, except for possibly one or two men, who might be chosen because of their ability rather than as representatives of sects. In lieu of Cabinet participation, sects would be offered positions of honor in the High Council, which would be advisory to the President. See paragraph 7b. below.</item>
<item>c. Some quid pro quo will probably have to be offered sect leaders, particularly <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName>, if latter is to agree “willingly” to surrender police powers. I understand that in the past <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> has indicated that he would like to be Minister of Interior or have one of his henchmen in this position. Such an appointment would be fatal and it must be made clear to new President that under no circumstances would we agree to this. It is possible that Binh Xuyen would settle for some economic assistance from the government in their commercial ventures. <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> and perhaps General <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> might consent to leave the country on some official mission if they were permitted to take out bulk of fortunes they have acquired.</item>
</list>
<p>6. Form new Cabinet. During this period, the new President will have been consulting with possible new Cabinet members. As quickly as possible, he should form his new government and announce it.</p>
<p>7. Reorganize government structure.</p>
<list>
<item>a. Our tentative thinking on this point has been covered in some detail in recent telegrams.</item>
<item>b. We feel it would be advisable under current conditions for President, after consultation with his Cabinet and separately with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and me, to appoint a “High Council”, consisting of representatives of various intellectual groups, labor, sects and other religious groups, refugees, and distinguished personalities such as former President Long. My personal judgment is that this Council should not include people like General <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName>, Bui Hoi, <persName corresp="#p_NVT1">Tam</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_TVH1">Huu</persName>, though French might insist upon inclusion of some such people.</item>
<item>c. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has indicated that he would favor appointment of an economic advisory council, including some foreign experts. Certainly technically competent people will be needed in economic field, though they could be supplied to government through French and American economic aid programs. However, it might be well to have them carried officially in an advisory council.</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_226" n="226" facs="0256"/>
<item>d. Based on our experience here, I feel that there should be a Vice President who can be used by the President as a general executive and trouble shooter to handle specific problems as they arise. It might be advisable to have a second Vice President in charge of two Ministers of Defense and Interior, since for the coming year these ministries will have to work very closely together in pacification of country and ferreting out of Viet Minh agents and influence.</item>
</list>
<p>8. Announce complete program of new government. This announcement should include:</p>
<list>
<item>a. The plan of reorganization of government.</item>
<item>b. The broad program of social, economic and military reforms embodied in the <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> seven-point program. See Embassy telegram 2004.<note n="6" xml:id="d108fn6">Dated November 29, 1954; for text, see <ref target="frus1952-54v13p2"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, vol. XIII, Part 2</ref>, p. 2315.</note></item>
<item>c. The detailed plan for the political and military integration of the sects in the national life. See Embassy telegram 4373.</item>
</list>
<p>9. Elect and convoke provisional National Assembly.</p>
<list>
<item>a. The necessary ordinances to establish the provisional National Assembly have already been published and May 15 has been announced as date for election of those members who are to be elected by village and other councils.</item>
<item>b. The Assembly should meet as promptly thereafter as possible. Its two most important tasks should be review of national budget and designation of a special committee to draft plans for a Constituent Assembly.</item>
</list>
<p>Part II. Paragraphs are numbered as in Department telegram 4412.</p>
<p>1. I believe French would do all possible remain aloof from any military action <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> might undertake against Binh Xuyen but would offer good offices to end or minimize any conflict. French would certainly do all possible in Saigon to protect own nationals and foreigners and property of both from harm, including public utilities.</p>
<p>2. Owing his special sense of mission, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will probably put up whatever resistance he can to being removed, but I doubt he will find substantial support in any quarter. In end he will probably retire in outrage from scene and voice his protests against <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, France and U.S. in some kind of “White Paper”.</p>
<list>
<item>a. Certain Vietnamese nationalists would seize on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s removal to fan anti-French sentiment, but I do not believe <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s removal would result in popular violence against French except possibly sporadic individual incidents.</item>
<item>b. I believe <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would ultimately accept removal as stated paragraph 2 above. I think he is true patriot and would not try sabotage constructive program of new government. I do not agree that he still has “considerable power” except support of France and U.S. I <pb xml:id="pg_227" n="227" facs="0257"/>have tried to convey to Department how slender basis of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s present support now is. If French and U.S. support is withdrawn, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will be hard pressed to muster any allies, and few if any of these are likely to resort to violence in his support.</item>
</list>
<p>3. National Army loyalty, which <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> does not fully command, is not completely transferable to any individual. I believe, however, army loyalty could be secured by new government more broadly based, not driven by political jealousies and crises like <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> regime, and fully backed by France and U.S. However, there may be individual battalion commanders in Center Viet Nam who might lead groups of men to defect. Such incidents would have very limited effect on bulk of army. It should be said here that under no circumstances should General <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName> be allowed return to Viet Nam now. He retains considerable influence in army and could become once again major disruptive influence.</p>
<p>4. Compilation of assets of strength <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> may have is difficult to make. With respect to political following in Center Viet Nam, this has been falling off partly as result of political activities of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s brother <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Ngo Dinh Can</persName>, and opposition has taken form for example of recent incidents at Ba Lang. There is no proper grass roots support of any leader in Viet Nam, leaving aside <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s virtues as anti-French leader have been tarnished by his dependence on his brothers which has led to quite general feeling that a <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> family dictatorship is in effect being established. Few nationalists outside his family and immediate entourage would lift a finger in <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s defense. How great his following is in Catholic community is hard to say. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> himself claims his support in center, for example, comes largely from non-Catholics. In any event Catholic community is not politically organized and represents less than 10 percent of population. Certainly many refugees from north were attracted by fact Catholic heads government of south, but political and physical strength of refugees is only a potential for exploitation at a later date. In National Army, scarcely any leaders are entirely pro-<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, even Chief of Staff <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName>; some are hostile, and the majority are probably no more than luke-warm. I believe there is no reason to anticipate serious adverse reaction in army at large if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is removed through orderly processes.</p>
<p>5. Viet Minh reaction to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s removal would undoubtedly be to effect that free world had suffered damaging setback. Apart from stepped-up propaganda campaign and public gloating over defeat of an enemy, I do not believe Viet Minh reaction would be dangerous. In other words, I do not anticipate Viet Minh would attempt take military advantage of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s removal. However, Viet Minh, playing many angles as usual, might attempt build up anti-French and anti-U.S. <pb xml:id="pg_228" n="228" facs="0258"/>sentiment, charging overthrow of nationalist government to French and U.S. “Imperialists”.</p>
<p>6. It would be preferable to make change after Bandung in order avoid giving Viet Minh propaganda advantage for exploitation at conference. However, since <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is still threatening to take independent action to remove <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> after Easter weekend, over strong French objections, it may be desirable effect change as soon as U.S. and French have reached agreement on case to be presented to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. While I recognize difficulties this crisis creates for U.S. in view of our well-known association with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, I fear continued delay will lead to even graver problems of deteriorating French-U.S. cooperation in Viet Nam, intensification of civil disorders culminating, possibly, in civil war, and not improbable ultimate loss of all Viet Nam to Viet Minh. This eventuality would be damaging not only to U.S. prestige but, more importantly I am convinced, to U.S. security. Mechanics of possible change of government are discussed in Part I above.</p>
<p>7. Our agreement to replacement of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> admittedly will be difficult to explain to American and world press. I would suggest something along following lines:</p>
<list>
<item>a. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had made a great contribution to his country at a time when his particular qualities were most valuable. He maintained calm after Geneva, contributed to exodus of refugees from north with its great psychological impact, successfully mustered world opinion in support of aid to these refugees and with support of France and U.S. developed sound and progressive social, economic and military reforms for his country.</item>
<item>b. Perhaps it was inevitable that implementation of these programs would develop divisive influences among the people of Viet Nam, who have only recently gained their independence. They have had little experience in meeting the complex problems which they face, such as reconciling different interests of sects and various regions of the country. This has resulted in clashes of personality, which had much to do with the current crisis, involving the “Unified Front” organization. Resultant bloodshed, even though not extensive, has created deep wounds which will be difficult for present government to heal.</item>
<item>c. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was unable or unwilling to take into his government members of various opposition parties. Only with broad support can the progressive programs developed by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> be made effective. The new government is headed by a man who has had experience in government and whose personality is such that he should be able to get other strong men to work with him. He has adopted the same basic programs which <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> initiated and which have the full support of both U.S. and France. Decision as to who should head government of Viet Nam is, of course, one to be made by the Vietnamese people under their own system. While change in presidency involves temporary loss to Viet Nam of a great nationalist leader, it does not in any sense mean a change in the policies of his government which have <pb xml:id="pg_229" n="229" facs="0259"/>drawn U.S. support. With this support and the cooperation of all elements of Viet Nam, the country can be saved from Communism.</item>

<p>4438. Eyes only Ambassador from Secretary. Have this morning discussed situation with highest authority. We are disposed to back whatever your final decision is but before you actually finalize we want to be sure you have weighed all of the factors which concern us here.</p>
<p>We feel that what has happened does not reveal anything new about <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> but rather a basic and dangerous misunderstanding as between France and the U.S.</p>
<p>We have always known the qualities which <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> possesses and those which he lacks. Nevertheless our two countries agreed to support him in default of any one possessing better qualifications. The only alternatives now suggested are the same persons who were regarded as unacceptable substitutes some months ago.</p>
<p>What has happened is that whereas the United States has been proceeding on the assumption that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would be backed as against any who might challenge him assuming that he had the capability, apparently the French have given their support only on the assumption that the Binh Xuyen would also be supported as an autonomous authority and that when they challenged <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> he would not be allowed to use force to assert his authority over it.</p>
<p>We can appreciate the reluctance of the French to see force used but if it cannot be used then what is the point of our supporting at great cost the national army which I thought it had been agreed was primarily to be an army for domestic security rather than an army to fight external aggression.</p>
<p>U.S. recognizes that Cao Dai and even the Hoa Hao are genuine sects with cultural religious and political roots which cannot be forcibly torn up without grave consequences which should be avoided but we do not believe that any central government can exist as more <pb xml:id="pg_230" n="230" facs="0260"/>than a figurehead if it does not have control over the national police and if this control is farmed out to a gang which exploits its privileges to protect vice on a vastly profitable scale and which exists by virtue of the backing of the self-exiled <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and the French.</p>
<p>We cannot see that replacement of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> by any persons you mentioned will of itself correct this situation and indeed we have had the impression that <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> was less acceptable to the sects than is <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>
<p>There are two other factors to be borne in mind.</p>
<p>One is that it is widely known that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has so far existed by reason of U.S. support despite French reluctance. If, however, when the showdown comes the French view prevails then that will gravely weaken our influence for the future both in Vietnam and elsewhere. Removal of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> under these circumstances may well be interpreted in Vietnam and Asia as example of U.S. paying lip service to nationalist cause and then forsaking true nationalist leader when “colonial interests” put enough pressure on us. The French constantly assert that the U.S. has a primary responsibility in this part of the world but it is difficult to have responsibility without authority. In essence, will not the ouster of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> on the present conditions mean that from now on we will be merely paying the bill and the French will be calling the tune. Any successor of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will clearly know where the real authority lies.</p>
<p>The second factor is that there will be very strong opposition in the Congress to supporting the situation in Indochina generally and Vietnam in particular if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is replaced under existing circumstances. We do not say that this opposition may not in the last instance be overcome, particularly if you personally can make a case before the Congressional committees but <persName>Mansfield</persName> who is looked upon with great respect by his colleagues with reference to this matter, is adamantly opposed to abandonment of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> under present conditions.<note n="2" xml:id="d109fn2">See <ref target="#d107">Document 107</ref>.</note> I wonder whether there is not some intermediate solution between the present extremes now discussed and that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> can be allowed to regain his damaged prestige by an assertion of authority over the Binh Xuyen and at the same time other elements be brought into the government under conditions which will assure a real delegation of authority.</p>
<p>I feel that as with most orientals <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> must be highly suspicious of what is going on about him and that this suspicion exaggerates his natural disposition to be secretive and untrustful. If he ever really felt that the French and ourselves were solidly behind him might he not really broaden his government? we must I think have some sympathy <pb xml:id="pg_231" n="231" facs="0261"/>for his predicament as he is constantly called “the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> experiment”.</p>
<p>In conclusion I want to reaffirm the very great confidence which we all have in you and in your judgment. You have done and are doing a wonderful job in the face of tremendous difficulties.</p>
<p>Your 4448<note n="3" xml:id="d109fn3"><hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note> has just arrived in Department but is not yet decoded. We will comment on it in subsequent telegram.<note n="4" xml:id="d109fn4">See <ref target="#d115">Document 115</ref>.</note></p>

<p>1. Ref paras 2 and 4 <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 4438:</p>
<list>
<item>a. While there probably is some difference between our outlook with regard to Binh Xuyen and viewpoint of Paris, which does create impression that Paris tends to regard Binh Xuyen and other sects as being on same level as <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s govt, this has not really been the case as between <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and myself. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> does incline towards dignifying revolt of the “Unified Front” of sects as a “legitimate revolution”. He once compared it to revolutions in Central America, in which we recognized the revolutionary government. I do not believe French have any special solicitude for Binh Xuyen as distinct from other sects. Fact that Binh Xuyen play chief role in most critical problem of present crisis, i.e. control of National Police, and are leaders of sect “Unified Front” has brought them into spotlight. However, in fact, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> has supported <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in this conflict, though he has not given the govt a free hand in moving more troops into Saigon during period of current truce. He is completely sincere in feeling that while the govt could drive Binh Xuyen out of Saigon–Cholon, result would not be a solution, even of the current situation but would lead to civil war and definite loss of country to Communism.</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_232" n="232" facs="0262"/>
<item>b. I have been here too short a time, and our intelligence (and I don’t mean to be critical) is not good enough for me to challenge this evaluation of <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> in which he is supported by men like <persName corresp="#p_GGLCF1">General Gambiez</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WM1">Wintrebert</persName>, who have been completely friendly to us and our approach, and who know this country and the sects far better than we do.</item>
<item>c. The root of the trouble is not in any divergence of U.S. and French views with regard to sect rebellion. Real reason that I feel it would be best to accede to replacement of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> himself, for reasons outlined in my 4448 and other messages, simply cannot successfully rule this country alone with the advice of his brothers and a handful of other advisors who have no public standing of consequence.</item>
<item>d. If left to his own devices, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would attack the Binh Xuyen Sûreté headquarters in the heart of Saigon, as well as Binh Xuyen headquarters on outskirts of Saigon–Cholon and their various posts scattered throughout the two cities. If this is done, there will be considerable bloodshed, destruction of property, wounds will be created which will be impossible to heal, and civil war may well result. A number of senior officers of <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> army are dead set against such procedure, and army itself would have no stomach for taking on the sects in a new battle of rice paddies and forests. Population at large would simply not comprehend initiation of warfare between govt and any non-Communist groups such as sects no matter what the issues involved. They know little of these issues and probably understand less.</item>
<item>e. There is no point in going back over the incidents which led up to this current situation. Irrespective of my personal views, responsible <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> leaders such as <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName>, <persName>Minh</persName> and their associates are convinced that current tragic situation could have been avoided had <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> shown any flexibility and adeptness in his dealings with <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> and other sect leaders. They may possibly be wrong in this, but that is their conviction.</item>
</list>
<p>2. Reference paras 3 and 7:</p>
<list>
<item>a. I do not know whether, at the time <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was selected for the presidency, any consideration was given to either <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName>. I voiced my doubts about <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s capabilities in estimates of the situation which I sent Dept at end of first week and first month of my stay here. See <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtels</gloss> 1830, 2108, 2250 and 2303.<note n="4" xml:id="d110fn4">For texts, dated November 15, December 6, December 13, and December 16, 1954, respectively, see <ref target="frus1952-54v13p2"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, vol. XIII, Part 2</ref>, pp. 2250, 2341, 2362, and 2379.</note> During period of these reports I agreed that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> appeared to be best available man, but did not rule out <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> as an acceptable substitute. I felt then and now that with full support from France and the U.S. <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> could make the grade, since then I have come to know <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> and have considerable respect for his ability, though he has less force than <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>. Each of these men has far more flexibility than <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and has an infinitely more practical approach to the problems of his country, which they know and understand far better than we do. We are not dealing here with fully rational, educated, unbiased Westerners. The <pb xml:id="pg_233" n="233" facs="0263"/>Prime Minister of this country must know how to direct and handle men who are highly venal, and who have not yet learned to subordinate their selfish interests for the good of their new and unstable country. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> cannot make these mental adjustments, and has no knack for the solution of these problems. <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> do.</item>
<item>c. [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] Reference <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>’s acceptability to the sects, it was <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> who offered this as a reason for not taking <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> into the government after he had promised me to do so. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> felt then and now that while the sects would not be happy under <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>, their objections could be overcome.</item>
</list>
<p>3. Reference paragraph 5: When it was agreed that strength of National Army would be determined primarily on basis of requirements for domestic security rather than to fight external aggression, it was considered that it would be used primarily against Viet Minh Communists. I doubt that anyone visualized its employment against the sects which despite their obvious faults, are perhaps currently the most effective organized anti-Communist elements within country other than National Army. It must be remembered also that, because of delays in reaching agreement regarding training responsibility, our <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> has been unable, thus far, to have much influence on the morale, discipline, and state of readiness of <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> armed forces. We have not had opportunity to set this army aside, reorganize it and train it, before it had to be employed in its [garble] pacification operation. In any event, whatever the reasons, fact remains that the leaders of this army would not be fully united, and personnel of the army would be completely unenthusiastic about embarking at this time on a civil war against even Binh Xuyen alone.</p>
<p>4. Re para 6, I agree completely that central government must regain control of National Police if it is to govern effectively. It is for this reason that alternative steps 1a. and lb. <gloss target="#t_mytel1">mytel</gloss> 4448 were predicated on this basic condition. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> agrees with us in principle on this condition and as I indicated would disagree only as timing and means by which transfer of police control should be brought about.</p>
<p>5. Ref para 8:</p>
<list>
<item>a. The charge that U.S. assent to removal of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would mean that we were supporting French colonialism could readily be contested. Both <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> are recognized nationalists. <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> for example, has never participated in any of the French sponsored govts. He and his brother <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName> (<gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> Ambassador in Washington) have, in fact, very strong anti-French bias. Furthermore, it was recently pointed out with considerable logic, and it is now generally accepted here that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> remains in office only because of French and U.S. support. Whether or not we wish it he thus bears the tag of foreign support, which in Asia is closely associated with “colonial interests”. This would be less true of <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName>.</item>
<item>b. As pointed out in para 3a., <gloss target="#t_mytel1">mytel</gloss> 4448, we should endeavor to have French propose successor, though he must be someone acceptable <pb xml:id="pg_234" n="234" facs="0264"/>to us. I feel sure that if <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s advice is followed French will not propose Buu Hoi, <persName corresp="#p_NVT1">Tam</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TVH1">Huu</persName>, or anyone else closely associated with French colonial interests. We would of course make clear that we would not let French call the tune as to the program of the new govt. My understanding is French have already agreed to both programs <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and I have developed.</item>
</list>
<p>6. Ref para 9:</p>
<list>
<item>a. I realize that strong resistance to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s removal may develop in US Senate. I have no way of judging <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>’s position <hi rend="italic">under present conditions</hi>. These conditions are rather different than those existing when he visited Vietnam in September, 1954 when he feared military dictatorship as only alternative to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> (see page 14, <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> Report<note n="5" xml:id="d110fn5">The reference is to “Report of Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mike Mansfield</persName> on a Study Mission to Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos,” October 15, 1954, 83d Cong., 2d sess., Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.</note>). As practical politicians, I would think that <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> and his colleagues on Senate committees would give considerable weight to the arguments I have advanced in my recent telegraphic letter to you, and other pertinent messages.</item>
<item>b. With respect to a possible intermediate solution, I can see none other than to have the police powers transferred now by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> with the full support of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and the background support of France and US. The outcome of such action I cannot clearly estimate. I repeat that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and his French colleagues are convinced it would lead to civil war; the suggestion that “at same time other elements be brought into the govt under conditions which will assure delegation of authority” is the one that really stumps me. For 5 months I have been trying to get <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to do just this, without any success whatever. I doubt that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could effect such a change even if he knew definitely that the only alternative to his not doing so would be his relief by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. As I have already pointed out, no strong man of ability that we know of will now join <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s Cabinet under any conditions. This is not just because they fear <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s govt may be overthrown by Binh Xuyen and sect coalition, but because they are thoroughly disillusioned as to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s work methods, and unwilling subject themselves to membership in Cabinet where they would be assuming responsibility but in fact have no authority.</item>
</list>
<p>7. Ref para 11: I fully appreciate the tremendous difficulties and complexities which <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has had to face. I have great sympathy for him and deep admiration for his courage, his objectives and his integrity. But I am simply convinced that as a matter of practical politics, he cannot organize and lead a govt which can successfully contest the unity of purpose, skill and efficiency of the Viet Minh under <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName>. And since our stake here, from moral, psychological and strategic reasons is so great, I feel we must, however reluctantly, be willing to withdraw our support from even as fine a man as <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in order to have any real chance of preventing the fall of this country to Communism. I may be wrong, but I do [not] feel that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is <pb xml:id="pg_235" n="235" facs="0265"/>completely indispensable. I am thinking in terms of our national interest and good of Vietnam, rather than in terms of a single man.</p>
<p>8. I hope this message does not appear to be contentious. It is not intended to be so. I fully appreciate seriousness of problems this situation presents to our govt and difficulty of their solution.</p>

<head>PARTICIPANTS</head>
<item>The Secretary</item>
<item>The French Ambassador</item>
<item>Mr. Merchant</item>
</list>
<p>The French Ambassador called on the Secretary this afternoon at 4 p.m. at the latter’s request.<note n="2" xml:id="d114fn2"><p>A transcript of a telephone conversation between <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and Merchant on April 11, 10:45 a.m., prior to this conversation with <persName corresp="#p_CMMJ1">Couve de Murville</persName> reads as follows:</p>
<p>“The Sec. said if we are going along with a replacement of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, is there any asset in talking with <persName corresp="#p_CMMJ1">de Murville</persName> and M. said yes so he and Paris feel he is being kept in the Sec’s confidence.” (<persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Library, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> Papers, General Telephone Conversations)</p></note> At the outset the Secretary spoke briefly of the current crisis in South Vietnam. He said that it was essential that the U.S. and the French should cooperate fully. He expressed his serious concern that if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> were to go, it would be regarded in Vietnam as a victory for Binh Xuyen. He considered it essential that any central government have control over the National Police. Certainly this was a requirement for any new Cabinet. Secondly, the Secretary said he wished to emphasize that any successor to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> must be a genuine nationalist and not a French puppet.</p>
<p>The Ambassador readily acknowledged the force of this statement. The Secretary referred to <persName corresp="#p_MFP1">Mendes-France</persName>’s remark last December that he did not resent <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> being anti-French because it was necessary for success that the leader of Vietnam be anti-French.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_239" n="239" facs="0269"/>
<p>The Secretary then went on to say that he expected difficulties with the Congress in securing the large appropriations which our continued support of the Government of Vietnam contemplated. Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>, who was very influential in these matters, felt strongly that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should be backed to the limit and that there was no adequate substitute for him. The Secretary also said that the activities of <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> in North Vietnam would be closely scrutinized by the American Government. The Ambassador interjected that he understood that the original plan to form joint companies with the Vietminh had been dropped. The Secretary concluded by saying that we would do our very best to minimize the consequences of the departure of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> if <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> should agree that such a change was necessary. He did not wish to disguise the fact, however, that we would have considerable difficulty.</p>
<p>The French Ambassador displayed but did not quote from a stack of telegrams he had received from Paris on the situation. He said that it was his understanding that the Government in France was forming its opinions and decisions on the basis of <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s recommendations and were inclined to follow whatever he suggested.</p>
<p>[Here follows discussion of European affairs unrelated to Vietnam.]</p>

<head>115. Telegram From the <gloss type="from">Secretary of State</gloss> to the <gloss type="to">Embassy in Vietnam</gloss><note n="1" xml:id="d115fn1"><p>Source: Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/4–1055. Top Secret; <gloss target="#t_niact1">Niact</gloss>. Although <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> is represented as the drafter of this telegram and <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> the clearer, the two previous draft telegrams (<ref target="#d112">Documents 112</ref> and <ref target="#d113">113</ref>), and the related telephone conversations described in footnotes attached to them indicate that this telegram was discussed at a much higher level. The fact that this telegram is greatly different from the previous drafts as revised by <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> leads to the conclusion that at the 5 p.m. meeting on April 11, referred to in <ref target="#d113fn1">footnote 1, Document 113</ref>, the decision was made to delay authorizing <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> to proceed with plans for replacing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. No record of report of the 5 p.m. meeting has been found, but a memorandum by <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>, April 11, indicates that <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> was not in favor of replacing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> at that time. <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName>’s memorandum reads as follows:</p>
<p>“We can accept <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ recommendation in principle. But I do not believe we should go along with his black-white formula. We should not discard <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> so abruptly or completely. There are several intermediary combinations worth exploring.</p>
<p>“The attached telegram is along these lines.</p>
<p>“Also I think <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ mechanics for the change-over put obvious [<hi rend="italic">obviously</hi>] a French and American label on the new prescription and the new injection.” (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/4–1155)</p>
<p>The draft telegram to which <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> referred was not found attached to his memorandum.</p>
<p>Apparently there were two draft telegrams discussed at the 5 p.m. meeting on April 11. The wording of the telephone conversation between <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> quoted in <ref target="#d113fn1">footnote 1, Document 113</ref>, supports this: “<persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> is with <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">R[obertson]</persName>, and he has <hi rend="italic">a</hi> cable. . . . The Sec. has redrafted <hi rend="italic">the</hi> cable.” Italics added. If this is the case, then at the 5 p.m. meeting the decision was made to send a telegram based on <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName>’s version rather than the draft revised by <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>.</p></note></head>

<p>4466. Eyes only <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> from Secretary.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_240" n="240" facs="0270"/>
<p>1. Your 4452<note n="2" xml:id="d115fn2"><ref target="#d110">Document 110</ref>.</note> received and your proposals and comments being carefully considered. I greatly appreciate the clarity of your views and the comprehensiveness of your replies to our comments and questions. In considering the decision to take on your proposal there are several questions as to timing and form.</p>
<p>2. As to timing we would appreciate your views on the following:</p>
<list>
<item>a) How soon is a final decision by the US Govt. required?</item>
<item>b) How many days do you visualize each of the first six steps would take outlined in part one of your 4448?<note n="3" xml:id="d115fn3"><ref target="#d108">Document 108</ref>.</note></item>
<item>c) It is strongly felt here that the US should make no final decision with the French unless and until we have received explicit assurances from them on the central government taking over control of the national police and a time and means for doing this with the clear stipulation of French moral and logistic support. In addition we do not wish to make commitment in principle on replacement before we are certain candidate acceptable to us can be agreed upon. This is a condition prerequisite to our informing the French of our final decision. Will other assurances be needed? Since this affects the timing of your proposals we would like your comments on this aspect. In addition there may be leaks as soon as the French are informed of an affirmative decision by us, thus <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> might learn of the proposal and take some counter action.</item>
<item>d) As a result of the above consideration we wonder whether any change should not take place until after the Bandung Conference. It may not be possible to carry out the program before opening of the conference in any case. If <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should learn of a French-US decision regarding his replacement, there might be some danger in his exploiting this development at the conference itself.</item>
<item>e) Another question of timing involves the elections for the provisional National Assembly on May 15. If the steps you have outlined in your 4448 were commenced after the conclusion of Bandung Conference it might be that the selection of a successor would take place at about the same time of the assembly elections. This might create an additional complication with respect to the reaction of the assembly and their inability to participate in a new government.</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_241" n="241" facs="0271"/>
<item>f) When a firm decision is made and dependent upon your answers to the above points, do you feel that our response should be given to the French in Paris or by you in Saigon?</item>
</list>
<p>3. As to form, it might be worth while considering how to continue to make use of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s assets and how to make the mechanics of a change-over seem Vietnamese inspired.</p>
<list>
<item>a) We have had in mind an intermediate solution which would not kick <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> completely out of the picture or keep him in his present status with full powers, which you have so tellingly indicated now appears impossible. Instead might not a transitional arrangement be envisaged which, if possible, would retain <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in some general capacity as chairman of a new council to make use of his good qualities and general standing as a Nationalist, while delegating detailed administration of the program to <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> who you believe have the personal capacities to direct and handle men in the Vietnamese environment. At an interim stage it would be anticipated provisional National Assembly convocation in June might lend a more permanent character to Vietnamese political institutions and personalities. It may be that a strong centralized government under the direction of one man is impractical as long as there is no really strong personality to cope with contending groups. Hence, it might be better for several reasons to blur the shift from <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to another man and to spread power and responsibility among several of the most competent Vietnamese available. We are in no position here to suggest the mechanics or the forms for carrying out this line of approach, but would like your suggestions.</item>
<item>b) We are also concerned that mechanics you suggested in paras. 2, 3, and 4 of your 4448 may give the impression that the decision and manner of the change-over would appear to come largely from the Vietnamese themselves. If <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> meets such personal and political resistance from his own people that he alone cannot form a new setup or carry on, as you emphasize is the case, then the conditions for change would be less harmful to our position in Asia and more conducive to effective succession if the Vietnamese proposed the new government.</item>

<p>4487. For the Secretary from <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>. Department telegram 4466.<note n="2" xml:id="d116fn2"><hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note> Following answers will refer to paragraphs reference telegram.</p>
<p>1. Reference 2a. We cannot say when decision by U.S. would be required. However, present tenuous truce may explode at any moment into open hostilities and as time passes we may unavoidably be placed in position where withdrawal our support from <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> may become even more difficult. Therefore, I believe decision by U.S. should be made as early as possible.</p>
<p>2. Reference 2b. Difficult to estimate time required for first six steps, but we estimate minimum of 10 days.</p>
<p>3. Reference 2c. Fully in accord that U.S. should definitely establish as prior condition assumption of control of National Police by central government. Timing of assumption of this control was discussed in paragraph 1 Part I my telegram 4448.<note n="3" xml:id="d116fn3"><ref target="#d108">Document 108</ref>.</note> Much as I would prefer, from purely personal standpoint, to have <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> assume control National Police before his relief as Prime Minister, it would be better to have new government assume credit as well as responsiblity for this essential change. With respect to other assurances, French should be required to agree in general with the programs referred to in paragraphs 4 and 8, Part I my telegram 4448. In addition, it should be understood between ourselves and French that Binh Xuyen must not be given control of or participation in Interior Ministry and that under no circumstances must General <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName> be permitted return Viet Nam in near future in any capacity.</p>
<p>4. Reference 2d. We doubt advisability of waiting to initiate steps outlined my telegram 4448 until conclusion of Bandung Conference. Admittedly there will be strong chance of leaks, but it would be difficult to prolong present uncertain truce until Bandung Conference is over. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has never publicly accepted truce of 15 days proposed by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. Truce <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and I arranged expires today, April 12. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has not yet definitely decided to attend Bandung, though ordinance announcing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> as chairman has just been published; this does not necessarily mean he will go. If he should go and word of his possible relief should leak out while he is there, such a leak might not be wholly disadvantageous. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is widely referred to in Asia as an American protege. If he were relieved during Bandung Conference, this would tend to indicate we had not taken upon <pb xml:id="pg_243" n="243" facs="0273"/>ourselves responsibility for determining who should be Prime Minister of Vietnam. This same factor would make it difficult for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> at Bandung to use his relief for his own propaganda advantage.</p>
<p>5. Reference 2e. As indicated above, I feel that action should be initiated with minimum delay. I think that we could obtain agreement from French and <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> to successive steps outlined my 4448, and have a new government in office prior to May 15, date scheduled for election of Provisional Assembly. I believe it would be essential that this be accomplished before that date in order that new government can supervise elections. One of fears expressed to me recently by <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> was that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would try to pack new Assembly with his adherents to exclusion of any opposing parties. Moreover, opportunity should not be afforded this new and untried Assembly to participate in details of formation of new government. It might be added that the ordinance creating the Provisional Assembly precludes that body from taking any responsibility for the creation of the government itself.</p>
<p>6. Reference 2f. We feel once a decision has been made in Washington, the French should be advised simultaneously in Washington, Paris and Saigon. This should be done with full recognition of fact that there probably will be leaks from one or more quarters. When and if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is advised by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> that he is relieved as Prime Minister, this will come as a tremendous shock to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. Leaks might prepare him for the shock and have additional advantages of giving <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and me opportunity of trying to persuade <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> not to sabotage new government if he should be disposed to do so. American public opinion also would need some preliminary preparation. Care would have to be taken, however, to insure that if leaks did occur, the initiative for the projected change is properly attributed to the Vietnamese and not to either France or the U.S. (See Paris telegram 4396.<note n="4" xml:id="d116fn4">In this telegram, April 9, the Embassy reported the results of a discussion with Nguyen De, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s Chief of the Imperial Cabinet. Speaking for <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, Nguyen De gave Embassy officials a long indictment of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s actions and suggested that a “supreme council” or “council of elders”, functioning under <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s overall direction as chief of state, should replace <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> as the functioning executive of Vietnam. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/4–955) For an extract from this telegram, see <hi rend="italic">United States–Vietnam Relations, 1945–1967</hi>, Book 10, pp. 910–911.</note>) I am sure Department will give consideration to preliminary background explanations to press and appropriate members of Congress.</p>
<p>7. Reference 3a. We are quite convinced <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would not accept any position in new government other than Prime Minister. Post as Chairman of High Council should be offered him by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, but I doubt that he would accept it. If <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should decide to refuse this post, there would be clear public relations advantages, if <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> could announce that this post had been offered to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. With reference <pb xml:id="pg_244" n="244" facs="0274"/>to utilizing Provisional Assembly to tide over change of government, we feel strongly that we cannot wait that long.</p>
<p>8. Reference 3b. As indicated above, we are fully in accord that throughout whatever successive steps are taken to make conversion, great care must be taken that changes are attributed to Vietnamese and not to either France or U.S. This may be difficult to achieve, but every effort should be made to that end.</p>
<p>9. I have not informed <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> of my recommendations. He has asked my reaction to his withdrawal of support of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. I have replied that I had reported his views Washington where I knew they were being carefully considered, but regretted I could make no comment at this time.</p>

<p>3622. You should inform Foreign Office orally of following and state we hope receive reply soon:</p>
<p>1. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> has told us of conclusion of <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will have to be replaced by a new president. We assume that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s views constitute those of French Government.</p>
<p>2. From start, U.S. and France have recognized that no ideal solution was available for situation in South Vietnam. Our course was based on an effort to choose best among the available alternatives, each of which had disadvantages. Accordingly, in order evaluate conclusion of <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> U.S. would have to know what alternative is actually proposed. Without prejudice to our present position we would want to know:</p>
<list>

<item>b. When is it proposed that any change would take place?</item>

<p>3. If the French government is now proposing that U.S. support an alternative for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, we would appreciate detailed and specific answers to these questions. In order permit matter to be discussed effectively, we would suggest that French government send a representative to Washington as promptly as possible to discuss its proposals.</p>
<p>4. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss> Embassies Paris and Saigon will note we have recognized problem French proposal that U.S. agree to join with French in discussing replacement <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. We wish to preserve this perspective and avoid issue being described as arising out of U.S. initiative. We do not wish in any way prejudice U.S. position to a decision as to an alternative to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, pending comprehensive reply by the French.

<p>4436. We informed Foreign Office orally today of view contained Dept’s 3622 repeated Saigon 4487.<note n="2" xml:id="d118fn2"><hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note> Official Ministry Relations with Associated States was present. We left with <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> informal memo Dept’s questions in paraphrased form.</p>
<p>Last night <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> summoned us to say that they had received a telegram from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CMMJ1">Couve</persName> informing them of an interview he had had with the Secretary April 11, gist of which was, they state:</p>
<list>
<item>1. Dept now willing to consider replacement <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> but that whoever or whatever might replace him would be strictly nationalist and have identification neither as puppet of French (like some previous officials) nor of Americans, as <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</item>
<item>2. Whatever steps are now to be taken to establish a more effective govt in Vietnam must not be made to look like a victory of sects, primarily Binh Xuyen, over <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> govt.</item>
<item>3. Steps should be taken immediately in Saigon to bring about “spontaneous” departure of <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> as Police Chief. This would presumably be done as part of whatever arrangements are made with Binh Xuyen as part of overall suggested alternative solution. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> <pb xml:id="pg_246" n="246" facs="0276"/>French observed that they agreed heartily with all three points. They observed that in deciding on next steps only Saigon is qualified to make a proper evaluation of all factors and recommendations for future action.</item>
</list>
<p>In discussing matter French expressed great satisfaction in indication that once again French and US views were approaching each other and that we would now be able to get on with the job. They reiterated strong conviction that decision to replace <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is wise one and that we must now devote all our efforts to finding substitute which will work. They refrained entirely from any reference to past Franco-US differences of opinion on Indochinese affairs. They laid most emphasis on point that they were now more convinced than ever that center of Franco-US action must be in Saigon. It was in recognition this fact that <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> were first sent and given powers they now enjoy by their respective govts. French intend to give their representative in Saigon freer hand than ever and trust Dept will do same with <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>.</p>
<p>We told <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> that we had no instructions from Dept since our last meeting on April 9 [<hi rend="italic">8</hi>] (<gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 3495 repeated Saigon 467<note n="3" xml:id="d118fn3">At this meeting on April 8, as reported in telegram 3495, April 9, French and American officials had a “further go-around” in which nothing definite was decided, but in which the French raised the possibility of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> creating a “council of elders” as a means of replacing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and broadening the government in Saigon. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/4–955)</note>), and therefore could not comment on Ambassador Couve’s account of his interview with the Secretary. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> If French account is inaccurate or incomplete would appreciate receiving guidance.<note n="4" xml:id="d118fn4"><p>According to telegram 3652 to Paris, April 14, the French account was inaccurate. The tenor of <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ remarks was not that the United States was ready to consider a replacement for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, but rather if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> failed because of difficulties in uniting Vietnamese elements and because of opposition from the Binh Xuyen, the United States in considering a successor would have to be assured in advance of that successor’s ability to run the government better. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/4–1355)</p>
<p>For a report of the <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_CMMJ1">Couve de Murville</persName> conversation, see <ref target="#d114">Document 114</ref>.</p></note></p>
<p>Today <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> reiterated principle that answers to Dept’s specific questions contained in <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 3622 and other related questions must be submitted by Saigon. They would forward questions to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> immediately and ask him to submit detailed plan for action as soon as possible after coordination with <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>. Govt would then pass on <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s recommendations here and they would be presented to us.</p>
<p>Suggestion that French Govt send representative to Washington was not well received on grounds that it would be unproductive for such official to go until plan was set by <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and coordinated with <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>, by which time its details would be known to Washington by means of normal diplomatic exchanges. In any event they will reconsider <pb xml:id="pg_247" n="247" facs="0277"/>question as plans for further action are devised in Saigon and submitted here for approval.</p>
<p>During our conversation with French we emphasized point that it was for French to set plan and that we would then consider whether we would support it. They offered no resistance to this concept and there was no indication of any sort that question of replacement of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had arisen out of US initiative.</p>

<p>4516. For <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> from Secretary.</p>
<p>1. I was much struck by paragraph 3 your 4502<note n="2" xml:id="d119fn2">Paragraph 3 of this telegram, which is dated April 13 and reports a conversation <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> held with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that day, reads in part as follows: “[<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>] said certain people with whom he had consulted recommend formation of an interim govt to govern pending general elections for a constituent assembly which would be held in possibly two months. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> gave some indication that he is tempted by this proposal. He said advantage of such a scheme would be to indicate that he did not wish to remain in power forever or to perpetuate a personal govt. Latter statement may have been intended as hint that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> might be willing to withdraw from govt if constitutional [<hi rend="italic">constituent</hi>?] assembly could be quickly formed. For reasons given in earlier <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">embtels</gloss>, I do not think this is feasible. I suggested to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> he proceed with plans for election provisional assembly May 15.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/4–1255) A very full account of this conversation, drafted by <persName corresp="#p_SPJ1">Sturm</persName>, is in <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> Papers, Vietnam File, Series VIII, Cooley (April 1955).</note> indicating that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> himself was considering formation of interim government to govern pending general elections for constituent assembly to be held in possibly two months and that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> indicated he did not wish to perpetuate a personal government.</p>
<p>2. I want you to know my profound personal conviction that a solution acceptable to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and which came out of Vietnamese action is infinitely to be preferred to decision imposed from without.</p>
<p>3. I cannot get away from the feeling that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> may not accept removal lying down but might at least try to become a national hero by attacking French-U.S. “imperialism”. This could become sensational at the Bandung Conference.</p>
<p>4. Even if this is no danger, certainly a locally selected successor government would be infinitely preferable to one hand-picked by France and U.S. and rubberstamped by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_248" n="248" facs="0278"/>
<p>5. Cannot the situation be held if need be for several weeks so as to permit of this orderly evolution? Might it not in the long run gain time? I would assume that de facto truce could be continued and that internal reforms could proceed.</p>
<p>6. This again is a matter where your local knowledge is so indispensable that I would not put my judgment against yourself, but I do want you to know that from here the risks incident to moving along the lines which <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> suggests might be acceptable to him do not seem any greater than the risks of proceeding abruptly to making a change which is imposed and not evolutionary in character.</p>
<p>7. I have suggested it might be worth exploring some sort of intermediate solution (my 4438 and 4466<note n="3" xml:id="d119fn3"><ref target="#d109">Documents 109</ref> and <ref target="#d115">115</ref>.</note>). I suggest you might tell him of official U.S. denial of Paris press story today (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 4515<note n="4" xml:id="d119fn4">In this telegram, April 13, the Department instructed <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> to inform <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> personally that an International News Service story, datelined Paris, April 13, was false. The story reported reliable diplomatic sources to the effect that the United States had agreed to a French request to replace <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> were looking for a man with greater ability and a larger popular and political following. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/4–1355)</note>) and at same time explore with him how his idea reported in paragraph 3 of your 4502 might be carried out.</p>

At 1:09 p.m. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> called MacArthur and informed him of the meeting and the decision to ask <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> to return for consultations. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> went on to add that participants at the meeting “think the situation is getting so confused between us that we must ask him to come back.” The Secretary then read the proposed cable to MacArthur for his approval. MacArthur concurred but added that in the last paragraph of the text, referring to a potential Congressional decision to cut off appropriations for Vietnam, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> might wish to add a reference to the $100 million for the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>. MacArthur noted that the French were banking on receiving this aid from the United States. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he might do this.

<p>4575. Eyes only <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> from Secretary. I greatly doubt that it will be practical to give any effective US commitment to a program for replacing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> without your going over the program personally with us here in Washington. To make any new plan succeed there will need to be a better understanding than can be arrived at by cable on the part of State, Defense and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, and also some Congressional leaders should be consulted as otherwise there will, I fear, be little chance of getting the needed appropriations. Therefore, I suggest with highest concurrence<note n="2" xml:id="d121fn2"><p>According to a memorandum of conversation by <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, April 17, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> traveled to Augusta for discussions with <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> beginning at 12:30 p.m. which covered a variety of topics. The following extract presents that discussion dealing with Vietnam:</p>
<p>“I showed the President a copy of my cable to <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> suggesting his return (4575). I had previously cleared this in principle with the President by telephone, and the President indicated his concurrence. We talked over the situation. I indicated that . . . , particularly General [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName>, had much more confidence in <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> than <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> had, and I thought <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ feeling that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> lacked confidence in him was because <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> did not consult with him on certain matters which he felt <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> might feel in honor bound to disclose to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>.</p>
<p>“The President agreed that we should not try to shift horses until we had another one to shift to. He also indicated his concern at the Congressional reaction, and said he felt it would almost surely mean cutting off the $100,000,000 for the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>.</p>
<p>“(As I was leaving for the airport, I received a message that <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> was leaving for arrival on next Friday morning [April 22]. I arranged to have this information relayed to the President.)” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> Meetings with the President)</p></note> that as soon as you get French proposals you should as rapidly as possible return with them to Washington for consultation here. We realize the risk of your being absent from Saigon at this critical time but also we realize that in view of the general trend of thinking here in Washington it would be almost impossible to get an effective switchover without personal consultation, <pb xml:id="pg_251" n="251" facs="0281"/>I hope you will feel that the situation can be held in status quo during your absence and that your return will not be misinterpreted. Unless you think of some better reason you can say that the Congressional hearings on next year’s Mutual Security Act are about to start and that appropriation for Vietnam is one of the most significant items and that you are required here briefly for that purpose.<note n="3" xml:id="d121fn3">Text of the press release to this effect, April 18, is in telegram 3687 to Paris, April 18. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.5–MSP/4–1855)</note></p>
<p>I hope that if you find this program acceptable you will do all you can to see to it that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s authority will be fully upheld in your absence. We feel that it would be a disaster if the French should unilaterally take action which would in effect supplant <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> or so weaken his authority as to require his replacement before in fact it was known whether or not there was a substitute program that could be agreed upon by our two Governments. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> should realize that the situation is in this respect very delicate and that any attempt by the French to rush us or force our hand in this matter would almost surely have a generally serious effect on US-French relations and in particular a Congressional decision to cut off appropriations and to accept the loss of Vietnam on the theory that the money and effort can better be spent elsewhere. This might also cut off the appropriation for <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>.</p>
<p>In the event you agree to flying here, to permit your rapid transportation, <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Admiral Stump</persName> who is now in Washington advises he can arrange direct Defense transportation from Manila.</p>

<list>
<item>“<gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> gives below unofficial (a titre officieux) response to questions submitted by Embassy April 13 to French Government:</item>
<item>“Question A (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 3622): French Government stresses once more fact that response to this question ought not be French but Franco-American. It is urgent then that necessary instructions be addressed by American Government to <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Gen. Collins</persName> with view to his preparation with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Gen. Ely</persName> of joint (communes) suggestions.</item>
<item>“It goes without saying that the personality eventually designated will have to be an indisputable nationalist and not be labelled as a man particularly favorable to French or the Americans.</item>
<item>“Question B: It will not escape U.S. Government that a decision ought be reached urgently. Not only does the disintegration of the country become accentuated each day but still further the tension at Saigon is such that irreparable harm can occur following the least incident. It would be eminently desirable that a conservatory measure be taken before expiration of truce April 20. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> could for example announce in course of day Monday the commencement of positive realizations and leave hope that crisis will be settled in its entirety before end of month. It could notably be made known that he has decided to convoke to Cannes to confer with him a certain number of political personalities.</item>
<item>“Question C: The chief of this sect (Binh Xuyen) has already promised, in a declaration dated April 12, the resignation of the Chief of the Sûreté and the placement of the police at the disposition of the new government which would be formed.</item>
<item>“At the time of preparation of new solution, the Chief of State would state precisely that the change of government ipso facto involved the departure of the present Chief of the Sûreté, his replacement being at the discretion of the new government.</item>
<item>“French Government considers that the Binh Xuyen problem must be examined at same time as the question of the sects in its entirety and following the principles of:
<list>
<item>“A single nation,</item>
<item>“A single state,</item>
<item>“A single army,</item>
<item>“A single administration.</item></list></item>
<item>“Question D: The procedure of which the French Government is thinking can be analyzed in three successive phases:
<pb xml:id="pg_253" n="253" facs="0283"/>
<list>
<item>“—A Franco-American phase,</item>
<item>“—A Franco-American-Vietnamese phase,</item>
<item>“—A Vietnamese phase finally, only this last phase being made public.</item>
</list></item>
<item>“Franco-American phase:
<list>
<item>“a) Four lists would first be prepared at Saigon by common agreement of Generals <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>, namely:
<list>
<item>“—Names of possible Prime Minister;</item>
<item>“—Names of members of present Cabinet to remain in future government;</item>
<item>“—Names of personalities not belonging to present Cabinet and capable of being called to participate in the next or any other organism of the new structure;</item>
<item>“—Names of the personalities who should be convoked to Cannes.</item>
</list></item>
<item>“b) Two governments French and American will then reach agreement on names to be retained (on lists).</item></list></item>
<item>“2) Franco-American-Vietnamese phase:
<list>
<item>“<persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> would be approached secretly and jointly by the French and American authorities who would submit their joint suggestions and would reach agreement with him, on the one hand on the personalities to convoke (to Cannes) and on the other on the principal members of the new government.</item>
</list></item>
<item>“3) Purely Vietnamese phase:
<list>
<item>“a) Within the framework of the agreement thus reached, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> would endeavor, in course of conference at Cannes, to reach a solution agreeable to parties present.</item>
<item>“b) It is then that he would make known his decisions to his people by a speech program which would forecast notably:
<list>
<item>“—Creation of a Supreme Council or High Council;</item>
<item>“—Municipal elections permitting at a date as near as possible the indirect election (l’election a un deuxieme degre) of a National Assembly;</item>
<item>“—Integration of the sects in the community, in conformity with the principles enunciated above.</item>
</list></item></list></item>
<item>“Question E: a) By the participation of the sects in the Supreme Council;
<list>
<item>“b) By the creation of a government of national union and not of clan (clan) and which would meet criticisms directed for a long time against the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government by the sects and, in a more general fashion, by Vietnamese public opinion.</item>
<item>“c) By a general policy of honors, indemnification and especially integration in the army or regrouping.</item>
</list></item>
<item>“Question F: Since the independence agreements, the French forces in the feeling of the government of the Republic are no longer <pb xml:id="pg_254" n="254" facs="0284"/>intended to reinforce (enforcer) any Vietnamese Governmental formation.<note n="5" xml:id="d122fn5"><p>In telegram 4512 from Paris, April 18, the Embassy sent the following correction:</p>

<item>“In conclusion French Government believes it ought underline following points:
<list>
<item>“The solution of the crisis can only result from a joint Franco-American action;</item>
<item>“It ought not be interpreted as a victory for those opposing the legal government;</item>
<item>“It cannot, in any way, end in the creation of a government which can appear to be under foreign domination.”</item>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Force Structure for Vietnamese Armed Forces</item>
</list>
<p>1. This memorandum is presented with the object of providing a convenient written summary of my position relative to current planning on the structure and cost of the Vietnamese Armed Forces (<gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss>).</p>
<p>a. <hi rend="italic">Size of the <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> by end-1955</hi></p>
<p>(1) I advocate reduction from the present 196,000 strength (forecast at 200,000 by 1 May as the result of Sect integrations) to a strength of 150,000 by the end of 1955.</p>
<p>(2) This drop of 50,000 will impose an admittedly heavy burden on existing administrative machinery and on the ability of civilian economy to absorb the dischargees and their dependents, totaling at least 150,000 people.</p>
<p>(3) A drop of 75,000 to an end-year strength of 125,000 is, in my judgment, beyond the Vietnamese capability, and will produce grave <pb xml:id="pg_255" n="255" facs="0285"/>economic and psychological problems at a time when we can ill afford the luxury of added complications. Such a drop totals at least 225,000 people including the 75,000 military.</p>
<p>(4) The need for increasing the emphasis on and means available for national security action and the prospect of added tension once election negotiations open this summer, as well as the Sect problem, all combine to convince me that not less than 150,000 troops should be retained by the close of this year. This number will not include conscriptees, since, as discussed in subparagraph c below, I feel that selective service inductions should be held in abeyance until 1 January 1957.</p>
<p>(5) A factor which is assuming increased proportions by the day is the magnitude and complexity of the program tasks confronting the <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss>. I am of the opinion that, based on experience of the past several months, the Vietnamese will simply have more than they can handle within the established time limits. In brief, we are expecting simultaneous accomplishment of the following major undertakings:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) Demobilization</item>
<item>(b) Reorganization</item>
<item>(c) National security action</item>
<item>(d) Retraining</item>
<item>(e) Selective Service</item>
<item>(f) Achievement of autonomy</item>
<item>(g) Resettlement of discharged personnel and dependents</item>
</list>
<p>b. <hi rend="italic">Status of the <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> in 1956</hi></p>
<p>(1) I propose that the <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> be retained at a strength of 150,000 throughout calendar year 1956. Apropos the preceding subparagraph, this number will include no conscriptees. Major unit structure would include 4 Field and 3 Light Divisions.</p>
<p>(2) My reasons for this position may be summarized as follows:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) Need for military strength during and after the critical election period scheduled for July 1956.</item>
<item>(b) Requirement for thorough preparations to absorb dischargees and their dependents into the civilian economy and indoctrination of the public concerning the need for reduction.</item>
<item>(c) Requirement for time to establish selective service machinery and to educate the population on the need for selective service.</item>
<item>(d) Continuing need for strong national security forces.</item>
</list>
<p>c. <hi rend="italic">Selective Service</hi></p>
<p>(1) The situation in this field amounts to absence of workable machinery and inability of the government to enforce conscription at the grass roots level. Furthermore, a major program of public education is required to “sell” the need for selective service. It goes without saying that if we attempt to induct the initial increment of 10,000 selective service personnel this year, we shall get in 10,000 individuals <pb xml:id="pg_256" n="256" facs="0286"/>who do not want in, and we shall be forced to release 10,000 who do not want out.</p>
<p>(2) I consider that the remainder of 1955 and the whole of 1956 should be devoted to establishing an effective selective service system and to educating the population on the need for peacetime draft. With these projects well in hand, induction can begin on 1 January 1957 in accordance with the present scheme for reaching an inductee strength of 40,000 (10,000 trainees, 30,000 fillers) under an 18 month service requirement.</p>
<p>(d) <hi rend="italic">Sect Integration</hi></p>
<p>(1) As for unit integration, I propose 9–10 light (500 man) battalions only (one per Sect province). Remaining integration up to the number conforming to the percentage of Sect population to the total population of Vietnam south of the 17th Parallel should be on an individual basis.</p>
<p>(2) Integrated Sect battalions should not be charged against the 4 Field and 3 Light Divisions of the Vietnamese Army; rather, be incorporated in the General Reserves.</p>
<p>e. <hi rend="italic">Reduction of Strength in 1957</hi></p>
<p>Commencing 1 January 1957, the <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> should initiate reduction on a phased basis so as to reach a strength of 125,000 by 1 July 1957 and 100,000 by 31 December 1957. This strength should be maintained thereafter for the active forces. The latter will gradually be augmented by reserves as the selective service system matures.</p>
<p>f. <hi rend="italic">Reduction in <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> Pay and Allowances</hi></p>
<p>I urge most strongly that existing <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> pay and allowances not be cut as part of our immediate program. Each soldier must support several dependents (a check of one regiment disclosed that each soldier represents 3.1 persons) and cost of living is high everywhere. Generally speaking, I have the impression that military personnel are getting barely enough to live on as matters stand now. A cut will not only contribute to a hardship situation, but will create an adverse pschological reaction within the ranks.</p>
<p>2. <hi rend="italic">Recommendations</hi></p>
<p>a. Reduction of the <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> from its predicted 1 May 1955 strength of 200,000 to an end-1955 strength of 150,000. Major unit structure of the 150,000 force should be 4 Field and 3 Light Divisions.</p>
<p>b. Retention of the 150,000 force until 1 January 1957, at which time a preplanned reduction to 125,000 should be initiated for completion by 1 July 1957. Major unit structure of the 125,000 force should be 3 Field Divisions (Vietnamese), 1 Infantry Division of 8,500 (Nung) and 3 Light Divisions. Integrated Sect battalions should be incorporated in the General Reserves and not charged against the Field and Light Divisions.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_257" n="257" facs="0287"/>
<p>c. Suspension of selective service induction until 1 January 1957, the interim period being used to establish selective service machinery and to educate the population on the need for the program in peace-time.</p>
<p>d. Commencing 1 January 1957, initiation of the present plan for inducting successive contingents of 10,000 for 18 months’ service, regular personnel being discharged in cadence with the rate of induction until the regular cadre attains a permanent strength of 54,000 and the inductee strength levels off at 40,000 by 31 December 1957.</p>
<p>e. Suspension of measures related to reduction of existing <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> pay and allowances.</p>
<p>f. Integration into the <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> this year of:</p>
<list>
<item>(1) 9–10 Sect light infantry battalions on the basis of one battalion per Sect province.</item>
<item>(2) Individual Sect personnel up to the number which, combined with those already integrated in light battalions, equals the ratio of Sect population to total population of Vietnam south of the 17th Parallel.</item>

<p>3697. French Ambassador called 18th and discussed Indochina situation in one-hour conversation with Secretary.</p>
<p>Ambassador opened by giving his interpretation present differences in viewpoints between U.S. France. While French believe solution to crisis should be studied in Saigon by <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> and recommendations put forward jointly by them so two Governments could make common decision, U.S. viewpoint appears to be French are suggesting replacement of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and that the U.S. would like to know details of French proposal which U.S. would then consider. French believe U.S. viewpoint unfortunate, since programs and steps should be undertaken jointly. They do not wish it said French alone are suggesting change, since reaction to unilateral French proposal would be bad. Ambassador then referred to French Aide-Mémoire contained in Paris 4503<note n="2" xml:id="d124fn2"><ref target="#d122">Document 122</ref>.</note> (U.S. and French versions appeared to be same).</p>
<p>Secretary stated we agree there is crisis in Vietnam. We believe crisis has developed because of inability of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to take necessary action against Binh Xuyen when they challenged Government. French seem to feel crisis has arisen because of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s general inadequacies. U.S. does not think it wise to make any change without being absolutely certain that alternate would be preferable. U.S. not wedded to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. He was not picked by U.S. Secretary questioned whether French had in fact fully backed <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. Without questioning <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s good will or French Government’s instructions, could not help having feeling lack of full support. The French Press continually refers to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> as being “U.S. supported”. Presumably if he fell, French skirts would be clean and the loss of prestige would be U.S. Since it is French who have proposed change, it is up to them to tell us what they have in mind.</p>
<p>Referring to Aide-Mémoire Secretary said could agree in principle to most of points made. However we are not faced with issue of principles but one of realities. Basic choice appears to be either abrupt change, having appearance of French scheme, or slower evolutionary change arising out of action by Vietnamese people. U.S. prefers latter. Among several reasons for this preference, Congressional reaction looms large. Secretary referred to upcoming Congressional <pb xml:id="pg_259" n="259" facs="0289"/>examination 56 budget. If <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> yanked out of office and replaced by French or French-U.S. formula, legalized by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, Secretary does not believe any chance of getting Congress to appropriate either money for support of Vietnam or for French Expeditionary Corps. Congress would wish to cut losses and utilize credits in other places where appears better chance success.</p>
<p>Secretary said <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> was asked to return soon principally to appear before Congressional Committees and to discuss Vietnamese problem.</p>
<p>Returning to formula put forward French Aide-Mémoire, Secretary pointed out Binh Xuyen enjoy police powers result <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> action. Can we assume <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> will withdraw these powers from which he apparently draws revenue? In past <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> has not indicated he puts national welfare above personal advantages. Another factor regarding removal of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is possibility he would not submit to abrupt removal by French or U.S. but would simply become another divisive factor working against any successor Government and be endowed with considerable local support. Only short time ago in Saigon Secretary was informed <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> enjoyed considerable popular support and that it was doubtful if he could be removed without highly unfavorable repercussions.</p>
<p>Ambassador replied it true <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> prevented <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> from trying to wipe out Binh Xuyen. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> did not do this because he supported Binh Xuyen but because, first, of doubt national army could do job successfully, and, second, if it did, Binh Xuyen would be driven underground to continue opposition. During December talks in Paris, French had expressed misgivings of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> but had no alternative solution. In interim, French had done best to support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> but even with such support, he is incapable. Ambassador said French felt insufficient time remained for working toward solution through elections in South Viet–Nam to provide basis for Government. Therefore something must be done by U.S. and French to find alternate solution at once.</p>
<p>Secretary reiterated U.S. position that of choosing one of two apparent alternate courses of action, specifically whether to proceed along the lines proposed by French, remove <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> at once and replace him with yet unknown person. This course was inferior from our viewpoint to more gradual and evolutionary change in the Government arising out of expression of desires of Vietnamese people. Also fact could not be escaped that, in the Secretary’s view, Congress would not appropriate funds if the course proposed by French were followed.</p>
<p>Ambassador remarked French felt necessary turn to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> to effect change in Government because there is no electoral body in Viet–Nam. The Secretary asked why an electoral body could not be <pb xml:id="pg_260" n="260" facs="0290"/>set up. The spectacle of the French with or without U.S. participating suddenly yanking <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> out of office and going through the motions of having him replaced by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> at Cannes would be unedifying.<note n="3" xml:id="d124fn3"><persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> changed the last word in this sentence from “catastrophic” to “unedifying”.</note></p>
<p>Ambassador asked our reaction if he should recommend to his Government that it send representative to Washington to be here for discussions during <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ visit. Secretary agreed good idea but we still unsure of <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ schedule.</p>
<p>Ambassador summarized by saying we have to solve problems of</p>
<list>
<item>a. Is it necessary to make a change?</item>
<item>b. If it is, to whom would we turn?</item>
</list>
<p>Secretary agreed and said in any change <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s strength should be retained as an asset for the Government of Viet–Nam and not a force against it. Also there is the question of dealing with the sects. We consider Cao Dai and Hoa Hao as apart from Binh Xuyen. Former have some roots in Vietnamese community and probably should not be drastically uprooted. Binh Xuyen have no such stature. Ambassador said he felt the sects should work with Government but should not run it.</p>
<p>Secretary agreed and stated their armies would probably have to be integrated to some degree in national army.</p>

<p>4661. For Secretary from <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>.</p>
<p>1. I met with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> at 0900 April 19. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> gave general historical review of his position, stressing point that he had always supported <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, even before my arrival. He repeated earlier remarks to effect that charges his subordinates had worked against his orders and on behalf of sects were false. He said “legend” French had withheld gasoline supplies from Vietnamese Army was no more than propaganda <pb xml:id="pg_261" n="261" facs="0291"/>and evidence bad faith. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is now engaging in propaganda war on <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>, charging him with being a “colonialist”, whereas, in fact, he hates the thing as much as the word. He said he had done everything possible help <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> until latter had incurred risk of civil war, feeling that Prime Minister should be supported, since <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had done much after Geneva maintain integrity of Free Vietnam, and thanks to him, refugees coming south had been so numerous. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> added that since he had defended <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> so stoutly, he thought himself able now express his full revised opinion which is that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> cannot be saved if we wish to save Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has played his part, but to keep him now would be to risk catastrophe.</p>
<p>2. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> continued that our common problem is now to save Vietnam from Communism. Even <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s own men feel he is incapable of governing. Army does not support him, except to extent that he breaks down army organization and discipline to attract individuals to his cause. Intellectuals are against him, and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> feels county is on verge of chaos. The few men who are still working with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> are inspired by him with feeling of hatred toward all forms of opposition. Sects are unanimously against <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> even <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Trinh Minh The</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> cannot now solve sect problem regardless of offers he might make to sects. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> added he feels crisis has reached such degree there is no longer any possibility of saving <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and that to preserve him artificially only prolongs crisis.</p>
<p>3. He added <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> cannot work with a new team and that Binh Xuyen will not surrender police control to him. With respect to modified <persName corresp="#p_NVT2">Thoai</persName> proposal, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said I had stated it would work only if three essential conditions were realized. These conditions cannot be realized except through great pressure exerted by France and U.S., and such pressure would nullify any good qualities inherent in proposal.<note n="2" xml:id="d125fn2"><p>According to telegram 4544 from Saigon, April 14, <persName corresp="#p_NVT2">Thoai</persName> proposed (and stated that the proposal had <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s agreement in principle) that an interim government be formed to carry on for 3 months by which time an elected constituent assembly would be in operation (elections were scheduled for May 15, 1955). This assembly would determine whether <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> or a successor should be premier and what form of government Vietnam should have. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/4–1555)</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> suggested as a modification, reported in telegram 4599 from Saigon, April 17, that the assembly should recommend to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> whether to retain <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> or appoint a new premier. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ three essential points were as follows: 1) the interim government should be made up of able men such as <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Minh</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_NVT2">Thoai</persName>; 2) <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should agree to allow these cabinet ministers to operate under true principles of cabinet responsibility and should agree to the decision of the provisional assembly as to his fate; and 3) the new interim government should take control of the National Police and Sûreté and appoint its own police chief. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/4–1755)</p></note> <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said conversation he held with <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> April 17 led him believe <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> was unwilling compromise himself by working with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> now. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that to maintain <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> as head of government would require such pressure from France and U.S. that he would inevitably <pb xml:id="pg_262" n="262" facs="0292"/>be stigmatized as most thorough-going puppet yet to govern Vietnam. Moreover, modified <persName corresp="#p_NVT2">Thoai</persName> plan would tend to eliminate <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> who is only existing legal power.</p>
<p>4. I said proposal as it now stands is that Provisional Assembly would “recommend” chief of government to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. To be sure, we would have to bring pressure on <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> to make him accept recommendation but that would not compromise such legality as he possesses. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said many people do not see problem in that light, and any effort to eliminate <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> prematurely before stable political institutions would be to court anarchy. I agreed with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> that for time being status of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> must be maintained, but felt proposal to have Provisional Assembly nominate Prime Minister, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> or someone else, would retain legal status of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>.</p>
<p>5. I told <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> had said selection by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> of new Prime Minister would cause <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s successor to lose one-half his prestige at once. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> may actually now have turned in his thinking to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. He said he believed worst possible solution would be to consolidate <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s position through intermediary of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. He said no elections can be held until tensions are relaxed and that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is incapable of exerting pacifying influence. Moreover, he said there is evidence <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is trying buy off sects, including <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName>, with U.S. money. He commented this was curiously venal practice for “pure” man. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he believes our first task is to solve present crisis and that cannot be done by means of modified <persName corresp="#p_NVT2">Thoai</persName> proposal which would not save <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> but, on contrary, might lose Vietnam.</p>
<p>6. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> repeated his belief that past support for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had not been an error. He said that we must now envisage changing Prime Minister but not policy. This, he said, corresponds to wishes of Vietnamese people. I asked <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> how he could prove such is will of Vietnamese people in absence of any Assembly. Statement can only represent <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s estimate. He replied it is obvious that people wish to be rid of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. I replied <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could challenge statement and, in any case, no one was in position to prove Vietnamese people wished to be rid of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said present crisis itself was evidence. I replied that crisis had been caused by sect minority looking after own selfish interests. Same governmental program under another Prime Minister would inevitably have led to opposition from sects. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that if such other Prime Minister had been similar to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> he would agree, but <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had handled situation very badly, and even his own relatives, <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NVT2">Thoai</persName>, no longer believed in him.</p>
<p>7. I told <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> he and I were foreigners here and even <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> was to some extent foreign. None of us could say whether Vietnamese people were united as to choice of any successor to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. Without Parliament, it cannot be proved to U.S. public and press opinion that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is no longer wanted. If <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was removed in absence of some <pb xml:id="pg_263" n="263" facs="0293"/>representative body, I could not predict U.S. Congressional reaction. Therefore, I urged <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> not discount solution unless Vietnamese themselves rejected it. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> repeated that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> remains in power only by our intervention. I said if his analysis was correct, an Assembly would vote <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> out, and if an Assembly did so, I believed U.S. would accept decision. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he knew he could not prove his statement, but he believed that to maintain <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> against popular will would be to diminish validity of expression of popular will when elections become possible. I said that, on contrary, modified <persName corresp="#p_NVT2">Thoai</persName> proposal would work only if acccepted by considerable body of Vietnamese opinion.<note n="3" xml:id="d125fn3">A note on the source text indicates that approximately 25 characters were omitted at this point in the coded message.</note> <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> is Franco-U.S. choice. I said I did not know whether proposal would work, that I intended to have further consultations today and only asked <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> not to prejudge outcome. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that, in his view, no solution could appear to be more marked as Franco-U.S. solution than maintenance of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. I said I could not agree with this since plan would not work unless good many Vietnamese agreed to it.</p>
<p>8. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that he must mark this as a point of disagreement between us since if plan did work it would be because of my putting pressure on Vietnamese. I agreed that <persName corresp="#p_NVT2">Thoai</persName> proposal, as modified, would work only if U.S. and France backed it, and if the basic elements were agreed to by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> et al and by Binh Xuyen. I reminded him Washington had not yet agreed to withdraw support from <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, and that if it did agree to withdraw support, such withdrawal would be very hard for Secretary and me to explain to American people. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he was unable to see how anyone was justified in maintaining <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in office against best judgment of people on the spot. With respect to possible working out of proposal, I told <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> my guess would be that Provisional Assembly would vote <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> out of office unless he had been brought to change his methods of operation. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said this was a difference of point of view between us, explained by fact that he has special responsibilities with respect to crisis which he feels cannot be solved as long <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is in office. He said situation is getting worse daily, and he attributes this wholly to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s influence. Situation is worsening in the center, and underground is growing. Only by surgery, that is removal of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, can country be saved. I said I did not believe situation would develop radically in three weeks, but I would present <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s views to Washington. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he did not believe situation could be solved in three weeks but could become irremediable in that time. He said that country must have psychological shock of change of Prime Minister.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_264" n="264" facs="0294"/>
<p>9. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> went on to say that, paradoxical as it might seem, south had never had such good chance of being saved. He rates this chance now at more than 50 percent. He said Viet Minh are losing their own economic battle. They have lost struggle for refugees, and they have not succeeded in consolidating their administrative apparatus. In south, people have not been too badly contaminated by Viet Minh and can still be taken in hand by someone other than <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>
<p>10. I told <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> we had received copy of French answers on Washington questions. I said one thing was missing; namely, who French have in mind as new Prime Minister and Cabinet members. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he would be tempted to give me names and that he was sure my list was similar to his. However, neither he nor French Government wants French solution. He was certain that if he gave me specific names, solution would at some point be made to appear French. I said Washington would still want this question answered.</p>
<p>11. I reiterated to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> I have publicly and privately reported support he has given <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. At same time, there is conviction in Washington that French Government has not given <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> full support but has been only waiting for an opportunity to get rid of him. That and fact France has simultaneously been carrying on negotiations with Viet Minh in Hanoi is why Washington is skeptical about French position. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that if he had not received instructions to effect that French colonialism was dead in Vietnam, that French Union was based on idea of equality, and that despite <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName>’s presence only <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> spoke for France in Vietnam, he would not be here now. He said that he and he alone is responsible for execution of French policy in Vietnam. I suggested that Paris might usefully say to Washington what <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> had just said to me. Van Laetham said that what happened in north had no connection with our problem here. I said that, on contrary, in Washington view there is intimate connection. Van Laetham said French understand our problem with respect to public opinion, but they have their own public opinion problem, and French Government had to attempt topreserve something in north. That did not mean, however, that government was playing double game. I again suggested that should be made clear to Washington.</p>
<p>12. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> must be retained as Prime Minister, he felt he could not continue to be responsible French representative in Vietnam.</p>
<p>13. To summarize <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s position, I said with respect to modified <persName corresp="#p_NVT2">Thoai</persName> proposal he made three major points:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he thought it would not work and would be interpreted as a solution imposed from without.</item>
<item>(b) <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> does not believe situation could be held in balance for six weeks.</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_265" n="265" facs="0295"/>
<item>(c) It appeared <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> felt that if conditions prerequisite to implementing modified <persName corresp="#p_NVT2">Thoai</persName> proposal were met, he would still feel he could not remain here or continue to accept responsibility during next six weeks. I had understood <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> to say he could not remain if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> remained permanently in power. I wished to know whether that stricture applied also to provisional solution.</item>
</list>
<p>14. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he did not believe in solution, that he did not think it valid, that he felt that new crisis would be upon us in three weeks, and that we would lose our last chance to save Vietnam. I said it appeared clear <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> would not accept solution. In that case, it could obviously not work, especially since there could be no question of replacing <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> at this point.</p>
<p>15. I suggested that I report later April 19 my consultations with <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>, <hi rend="italic">et al.,</hi> and with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. I said to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> I did not know what would be outcome of my trip to Washington. I believed that if Vietnamese agreed to modified <persName corresp="#p_NVT2">Thoai</persName> proposal, U.S. would support it if French would. In any case, I thought it worth trying. I said that in any case I believed that with U.S.–French support and cooperation there would not be outbreak of civil war during my absence. I said I was very concerned that if French Government has decided that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> must leave at once, without any transitional phase, decision might be to end U.S. aid. I said <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> might think such a decision would be grave mistake, but it might still be taken by Congress through cutting off appropriations.</p>

<p>4662. To the Secretary from <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>.</p>
<p>1. I met with <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>, <persName>Minh</persName> and Tran Van Van 1500 April 19 to review with them their reactions to modified <persName corresp="#p_NVT2">Thoai</persName> proposal. I <pb xml:id="pg_266" n="266" facs="0296"/>went over each step carefully, so that there would be no misunderstanding as to my meaning.</p>
<p>2. <persName>Minh</persName>’s reaction was that situation was now much worse than in period before his resignation and crisis would be much more easily resolved without <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> than with him. <persName>Minh</persName> said he tended to favor early general elections to set up a constitutional assembly in 3 or 4 months. Meanwhile, a coalition government would be necessary, but it would be difficult to form with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>3. <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> said he had no specific commentary to make on the proposal but wished to contribute an analysis of crisis. The two main elements, he said, are <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s government and sects’ position. A third and less crucial factor is political opinion of opposition other than sects. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s obvious errors and faulty methods have created moat between him and all other elements in the society which is becoming broader and deeper, and contacts between <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and others are becoming more remote. With regard to sects, these groups know the problem they createmust be resolved. He feels only way to resolve problem is progressively through mobilizing public opinion and creating an atmosphere in which sects can be induced accept peaceful solution. Problem could have been resolved more easily at an earlier time. <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> said he did not think <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and any team he might gather could resume effective contact with sects.</p>
<p>4. <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> discussed in a generally unfavorable sense <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName>’s idea of having <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> convoke a congress.<note n="2" xml:id="d126fn2"><persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> made this suggestion, as reported in telegram 4599, April 17, in a discussion with <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> on April 15. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/4–1755)</note> He said the congress would be more quickly set up than a Provisional Assembly and would be more manageable. However, owing to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s absence in France, present political roles of sects and attitude of other political groups, he believed congress not practicable. <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> said he thought the best solution would be provided by a Provisional Assembly, but political groups are fearful of any assembly constituted under <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>5. <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> said that in his view means should be found to allow Vietnamese public opinion to be heard. He had suggested congress as a means to that end. If there were an assembly present, crisis could be more easily resolved. A congress, operating under Binh Xuyen menace, might remove <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and this could be interpreted as victory for sects with unfortunate effects in U.S. <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> suggested as possibility that congress berepresentative only of political groups and not of sects. If Provisional Assembly solution were adopted, it would be necessary find interim government to function for period of perhaps six weeks and thus problem remains of creating a new government. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is a barrier to solution of this problem. <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> referred to fact that <pb xml:id="pg_267" n="267" facs="0297"/>during nine years of war no government could obtain popular support for struggle against Communism because they were all French puppet governments. Problem now is to gain popular support to continue resistance to Viet Minh. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s government has not succeeded in convincing people or political groups of necessity to carry on anti-Viet Minh struggle. Only a government fully supported by people can do that, and such a government must come from some kind of popular body, either an assembly or a congress. As a practical test of whether provisional government followed by Provisional Assembly would be acceptable solution, <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> suggested asking specific individuals, such as <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> and <persName>Minh</persName>, whether they would agree to enter such provisional government. <persName>Minh</persName> said that he would agree to enter a provisional government if political groups represented by <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> and others accepted, but he felt this solution had been overtaken by events. <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> said that if an immediate answer from him was required, it would have to be negative. He added that, in his opinion, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> cannot now organize an interim government.</p>
<p>6. Van said that he felt <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> might accept the proposal but that proposed members of new team, thinking <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> incapable of change, would not agree to participate. He said that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> does not have support in the country, and while his group would risk almost anything for a good solution, they would not take the chance of participating in interim <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Cabinet.</p>
<p>7. I said that if Vietnamese leaders were unable to find solution, and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was removed under circumstances which pointed to sect victory, it would be very difficult to obtain popular support in U.S. for continuation of U.S. aid. I therefore urged participants to consider matter further and to find some other solution if that which we discussed seemed impracticable to them.</p>

<p>4663. For Secretary from <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>.</p>
<p>1. I called on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> 1800 April 19 and asked whether he had considered further modified <persName corresp="#p_NVT2">Thoai</persName> proposal. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> handed me following note (in English):</p>
<list>
<item><hi rend="italic">Begin verbatim text.</hi></item>
<item>1) I agree with idea of coalition if it is truly to obtain representation for the great majority of the people;</item>
<item>2) This is in accord with my belief in government which represents the people—and toward which I have been trying hard to bring Vietnam against so many difficulties;</item>
<item>3) I do not feel that the names given to me as suggestions for members of my cabinet—men from small opposition parties who actually represent only a handful of people—are in accord with the principle of having the great majority of the people represented in the Government—which I understand is our mutual desire. Certainly this is the political principle of the United States in its own government;</item>
<item>4) I agree that no one man should manipulate the election of a National Assembly so that he dominates it falsely. This is the very reason why I have proposed that we hold a general election—in a manner which will be most familiar to my people—to elect a National Assembly;</item>
<item>5) With a general election, there is every reason to expect that the people will be represented by people of their own choosing—and not by self-appointed spokesmen for the people;</item>
<item>6) I do not believe any freedom-loving Vietnamese—and we all know that we are facing a clear decision between freedom and Communism here—is fearful of Communists being elected to high position through the means of a general election;</item>
<item>7) I would prefer to let an assembly chosen by all the people in a general election be the deciding factor in the continued life of this government—than to have a complex system of contrived representation do so, no matter how wisely this system was devised by a group of men. The people are the ones whose lives are at stake. They should be given a voice in their own future;</item>
<item>8) On the basis of these principles dear to me, and to free men throughout the world, I am willing to accept coalition.</item>
<item>April 19, 1955. <hi rend="italic">End verbatim text.</hi></item>
</list>
<p>2. With reference to last paragraph of note, I asked whom <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would take into a “coalition”. He said that his Cabinet ministers should be “capable, neutral” men. He made a point which the note does not make clear that the coalition he envisages would be formed <pb xml:id="pg_269" n="269" facs="0299"/>after general elections to be held in3 or 4 months. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said that his government must fight Communism, feudalism, and colonialism. If it had 5 or 10 years it could use various peaceful measures. However, owing to exigencies of situation, military pressure must be used. He said he believed the people were in accord with that principle.</p>
<p>3. I reminded <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that there is no election law and no election machinery. I said all those I had consulted agreed that general elections were not now practicable. I added that in my view his government could not continue for three months as it is now. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> replied that he believed when people knew elections would take place in three months they would change their attitude. I asked what he proposed to do in the meantime. He said he would carry out reforms and programs with which I was familiar, and to do this he proposed to choose only additional Cabinet members having same political concepts as himself. He said the struggle is very hard and there can be no compromise.</p>
<p>4. I asked if he thought <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> was in favor of colonialism, feudalism, and Communism. He said that <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> favors compromise methods. I asked the same about <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> avoids difficulties and has no plan. I asked same about <persName corresp="#p_NVT2">Thoai</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_NVT2">Thoai</persName> is anxious only to return to his chemical laboratory.</p>
<p>5. I told <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that I did not know what would happen to his government and country if he continued on present course since I believed his solution must lead to civil war. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> replied that he realized risks were involved, and that he never ceased to reflect on nation’s problems. He said compromise had lost the war against Viet Minh. I said that in my opinion Vietnamese people did not want civil war. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> replied that neither did he wish civil war, but added that “feudalists” are unscrupulous. I said that I must report to my government that I believed <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s course of action must lead to civil war.</p>
<p>6. I told <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that all Vietnamese with whom I had talked were likewise opposed to colonialism, feudalism, and Communism. However, they differ as to methods of tackling these problems and do not approve of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s way of working. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said that on the contrary they did not oppose his methods, but his political concepts. He added that every time a compromise is made the problem returns in more acute form. The people do not like this.</p>
<p>7. I asked what <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would do if <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> decided to make a change of Prime Minister. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> has power to do so and will decide. However, experience in Vietnam during the war had proved compromise to be ineffectual. It will be unfortunate if <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> does not accept his course of action. I told <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that I believed that if no coalition were effected prior to elections, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> would make a change. I had tried to assist Vietnamese to avoid drastic solution <pb xml:id="pg_270" n="270" facs="0300"/>of this sort, but unless government is effectively broadened, I believe there will be a change. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said he was continuing his political conversations to test acceptability of his ideas. I said I hoped he would do everything possible to avoid open conflict during my absence. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said that if he had removed <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> as Chief of Police in beginning, he would now have Saigon well in hand.</p>
<p>8. I asked if he had had any reports from <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Luyen</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> replied that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> was absent when <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Luyen</persName> arrived. He said that <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Luyen</persName> had reported that people in Paris had no understanding of what was going on in Vietnam.</p>
<p>9. On taking my departure I said that in my opinion <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> would remove <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> if he continued as at present. I had done my best to help. I admired his accomplishments and his character, but not his method of working and only regretted that I had not been able to do more for him and his country.</p>
<p>10. I see no alternative to the early replacement of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>

<p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Joe</persName>: I am very sorry indeed not to be here when you arrive.<note n="2" xml:id="d128fn2"><persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> left Washington on April 20 for a vacation at Duck Island, Lake Ontario. (Princeton University Library, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> Papers, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ Appointment Book)</note> I shall, of course, see you quickly when I get back on Monday.<note n="3" xml:id="d128fn3">April 25.</note> In the meantime, here is a sample of my thinking.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was picked not by us but by the French. We have backed him and backed him 100% because (a) nobody better appeared on the horizon, and (b) because no one can survive without <hi rend="italic">wholehearted</hi> backing.</p>
<p>The French, however, have long since become dubious about <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, and, while I have no doubt that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> personally has been loyal, the French Government and press have made no secret of their desire to find a replacement. The French press has uniformly put the United States label on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. To them he is always “American-backed <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>” or “the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> experiment”. Never have they suggested <pb xml:id="pg_271" n="271" facs="0301"/>that he is “French-backed” or looked upon as other than an “experiment”.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the crisis came when <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was threatened by a minor act of insurgency by the Binh Xuyen. It happened that that occurred when I was lunching at the White House with a bipartisan group, Congressmen one day and Senators the next. I told them that this was just the opportunity we had been waiting for to find out whether <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had the courage and determination to <hi rend="italic">act</hi> and whether he had the loyalty of the Army. I said that if these two things were demonstrated, then I thought we were over the hump; but that if he failed in either respect, then he would have to go. But at least we would have the answer. Therefore, it came as a tremendous shock and disappointment when we learned that, although <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> did have the determination to act and although he apparently did have the loyalty of the Army, the French prevented his acting and allowed the Binh Xuyen to defy him with impunity and to compel him to make a “truce” which put the National Government on a parity with a bunch of gangsters.</p>
<p>I am not surprised if many in Vietnam interpreted that as the writing on the wall and hurriedly disassociated themselves from what seemed to be a doomed government. I say this without ignoring the fact that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s own characteristics, long known to us, may have contributed appreciably to this result.</p>
<p>My attitude now is the same as it has always been and frequently expressed to the French, namely, if every change can be made to advantage, we are open-minded to it. However, it would seem to me disastrous to destroy the morale and authority of the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government even before we have any idea as to what would come next.</p>
<p>Among other things that need to be explored in this connection is the question of what change can obtain financial backing from the United States comparable to that which we are prepared to give <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. This is a matter not just for the Executive but for the Congress and those who have leadership in this matter, such as <persName>Mansfield</persName> in the Senate and Walter Judd in the House, are very strongly opposed to any shift. As things now stand, they would, I think, throw their influence, perhaps decisively, against backing any substitute that now seems in sight.</p>
<p>Also, I wonder whether it can be taken for granted, as it seems to be, that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will get out quietly and not himself raise a flag of rebellion against a successor régime as “colonialist”. If he has the idealistic and stubborn qualities which have been attributed to him, I would think that there was risk about this.</p>
<p>Such considerations seem to me very important. I recognize that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> probably cannot carry on without a broader base, although if he had United States and French support, the loyalty of the Army, a <pb xml:id="pg_272" n="272" facs="0302"/>considerable popular support, and <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> and Hoa Hao benevolent neutrality, that is a not negligible base. But if change is to be effected, can it not come as a gradual evolutionary process and not as an abrupt break? I fear the latter would have consequences which would be disastrous.</p>
<p>It is because of these reasons that I am glad that you are here.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> is fully aware of our thinking and while <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Walter Robertson</persName> is unfortunately also away, others here have been sitting in on all the talks. Also, of course, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has a big and helpful interest in the situation, as do the Defense people.</p>
<p>I think it important that you should talk with the Congressional Committees or Subcommittees. But perhaps this could usefully be deferred until there is a clearer line of policy agreed on by the Executive Branch.</p>
<p>It seems to me that, so far, the French come up only with generalities which sound good, but that when it comes actually to filling in the blanks with names and with money, then the trouble begins.</p>
<p>With my very best wishes, and looking forward to seeing you on Monday, I am</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>

</list>
<p>Nguyen De called yesterday to deliver an urgent message from <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> whom he had just left in Cannes.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_273" n="273" facs="0303"/>
<p>He opened the conversation by restating the observations made during our last interview reported in <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 4497 repeated Saigon as 664.<note n="2" xml:id="d129fn2">In this telegram, dated April 16, the Embassy had reported that it had that morning, as instructed in telegram 3678 to Paris, April 15, informed Nguyen De that the United States hoped <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> would give favorable attention to a compromise to be based on a formula put forward by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, according to which elections would be held for a constituent assembly in 3 months, after which the assembly would choose a government. In the meantime, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would form an interim government. “While De assured us he would faithfully present Dept’s views to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, he made no secret his personal opposition to formula as outlined. He emphasized at length his fundamental opposition to the holding of general elections in South Vietnam in the near future for reason Communist elements would be only beneficiaries and, in any event, he said, no really effective interim govt could be formed so long as <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> headed it.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/4–1655 and 751G.00/4–1555)</note> He described <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s reaction to the proposal that a National Assembly be formed in three months by some form of universal suffrage as impossible to carry out on practical grounds. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> described it as “madness” (une folie). <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> was now more convinced than ever that before any long-term plans, no matter how meritorious, could be put into effect, the immediate problem of dealing with the present crisis must be faced. In his opinion all other considerations must be cast aside for the moment if the battle against Communism in South Vietnam is to be won. The first step is the all important one of dealing with the present crisis. There is no longer any time to lose for the sects are enforcing their positions and becoming more intransigent. Any further procrastination will drive them underground and eventually into the hands of the Vietminh.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> agrees that power must be removed from the hands of the Binh Xuyen but considers it impractical to do so in one fell swoop since it would be impossible to maintain order afterwards and civil war would really result. He is aware of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s qualities as often cited but regards his present position as untenable. The problem is now, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> says, how to deal with the present crisis in removing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> from his present position without losing U.S. aid. Without U.S. aidVietnam would cease to exist and it is unthinkable to plan her future without both U.S. and French friendship.</p>
<p>In considering the plan for dealing with the crisis which is set forth below, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> wishes to make a categorical statement that he will do nothing regarding this plan or otherwise without prior U.S. and French approval.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s suggested solution is that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> must be removed from the scene for the time being. The problem is how to do this without antagonizing the U.S. and precipitating the withdrawal of U.S. aid. Whatever Government is in power must have not only the representation of all leading Vietnamese religious and political factions but must have true responsibilities for governing. Under the present <pb xml:id="pg_274" n="274" facs="0304"/>system the Government is divided roughly into three parts: (1) The Chief of State (<persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>), (2) The Government itself with its Cabinet and (3) The “Provisional National Council” (National Assembly, etc.—not yet formed). The role of the Chief of State is presently that of arbitrator and catalyst in getting things done. He provides legality for the exercise of true powers which are held by the Government. The first prerequisite of any future Government is that it have a degree of stability which can only be attained if its members agree to retain their offices as long as the Prime Minister remains in power. This is unenforceable, of course, but an attempt should at least be made to have members of Cabinet accept such a moral obligation.</p>
<p>In his proposed plan, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> advocates that in addition to a Government with a Prime Minister and Cabinet of approximately 12 men, there should be a “Supreme Council of National Union”. This latter body would form the third element of a three-part Government in place of the non-existent provisional national council. It would participate with <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and the Cabinet in the exercise of real and not advisory powers. Its main distinction from the Cabinet itself would be that it would include representation of all factions including sects, religious groups, army, peasantry and trade unions. In this connection, De remarked that at the present time, the peasantry and syndicates—in which category he would include skilled labor—represent about 95% of the population and now have no representation in the Government. On the other hand, the Cabinet would be made up of leading “notabilities” who would be men who need not necessarily belong to any political or religious group but who would, as a sine qua non, have universal responsibility and the confidence of the country as a whole. It is intended that the Council of National Union would be a temporary body which would disappear as soon as constituent and legislative assemblies were formed. It is suggested that its membership should be between eighteen and twenty. It is contemplated that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> would direct and advise it in regard to its functions without participating in it directly. On the other hand, the “notabilities”, who would make up the Cabinet, should have both technical, political and moral qualifications but need not be active members of political or religious groups.</p>
<p>It is suggested that when the Supreme Council of National Union is formed its main political premises should be fixed in advance. Its powers would go beyond these minimal guidelines but would never contradict them. Included in the minimum program would be the following political principles: (1) Alignment with the West; (2) Strictly anti-Communist and (3) Furtherance of democratic principles, et cetera.</p>
<p>De then returned to the question of how to replace <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> without “antagonizing the U.S.” He stated that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> was opposed <pb xml:id="pg_275" n="275" facs="0305"/>to any return to past ills in the form of Vietnamese statesmen who had already participated in post-war Governments and had failed, and that no indication be given to the sects that in the present crisis it is they who have won and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> who has lost. A man must be found to be Prime Minister and in <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s opinion the best candidate is <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Pham Huy Quat</persName>. It is suggested that <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> be approached in a confidential manner after U.S. approval is obtained and be asked to come to Cannes, together with two or three other leading personalities. Once there, he and <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> would undertake the choosing of ten or twelve men who might take part in the proposed new Government. Negotiations on such participation would proceed without delay. Convocation of <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> would only take place with prior U.S. and French agreement. Once the step of <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>’s convocation is taken, discreet steps would be taken to convoke <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, steps having been taken in advance to give the impression that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is in agreement with this whole matter which, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> claims, can be arranged. He would then take part in negotiations for a new Government and might actually participate himself. However, that would be determined during consultations and negotiations here and in Saigon.</p>
<p>If the U.S. agrees to this plan (and presumably the French), <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> states categorically that he can put it into effect and can obtain <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>’s full concurrence (<persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> is aware that “he is in <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s eye”) and guarantees (1) that he can persuade the sects not to take part in the Government but only in the Council and in a limited manner; (2) that he will obtain agreement of the sects to incorporate all their forces into the National Army, and (3) that the Binh Xuyen will agree to give up all its control of “national security” including, of course, the police in Saigon. The entire operation, however, must be done as one move with each step following rapidly upon the other. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> is confident he can carry it off and will engage his personal prestige with the U.S. in doing so, but he will not undertake the plan unless he has full prior U.S. agreement including a firm understanding that under no circumstances will the U.S. take any action or make any statement which will indicate to the Vietnamese that <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> is “a U.S. man” and that he will in no sense be acting under U.S. influence as Prime Minister. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> emphasizes the importance of the fact that <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>, who already enjoys considerable prestige and following, and who will receive all that of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and of other factions in Vietnam, whom <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> can influence to support him, must not be suspected as being a tool of the West and particularly of the U.S.</p>
<p>In reply to our question as to how and when the French were to be brought into this plan, De stated that it is for us to determine that it would presumably be at an early stage. He claimed that <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> could not succeed on his own but that he could with his present following <pb xml:id="pg_276" n="276" facs="0306"/>and that which he will undoubtedly receive once <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> “gets the wheels moving.”</p>
<p>De reported that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> presents this as the last and possibly only plan left for dealing with the present crisis. It is not to be confused with any other plans which may be attributed to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName> was not informed of it when he called on <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> prior to returning to Washington and is not, therefore, au courant with it. <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Ngo Dinh Luyen</persName> is still cooling his heels in Cannes as <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> has refused to receive him while this plan was being presented to us. De incidentally informed us that <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Ngo Dinh Luyen</persName> has told <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> in seeking an audience that he was informed by U.S. officials that they supported his plan and that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> must consider it immediately. This is totally untrue as far as this Embassy is concerned as we have had no contact with <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Luyen</persName>. Needless to say, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> strongly favors this plan and states “that if the U.S. opposes it and obliges the Vietnamese people to continue to accept <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> as Prime Minister, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> will give in to U.S. views because Vietnamese national interest does not permit Vietnam to do otherwise and because U.S. aid is the prerequisite to her survival, but he will do so on conviction that we are mistaken and in full conscience that it will lead to a national disaster.” In that case he feels obliged to inform us that he will no longer be able to take any responsibilities for the present Government in Vietnam.</p>
<p>We asked how prepared if at all <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> was to go along with such a plan and De stated that he (<persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>) was already aware that he was being considered and that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> guaranteed that he would come to Cannes immediately as soon as summoned. Finally, De said that he would remain in Paris until he received an answer from us which he would take to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> immediately. He closed again reiterating the importance of prompt action.</p>

<p>At 4:45 p.m. on April 21st, I was visited by Pierre Millet, Minister of the French Embassy, Washington, DC, who discussed with me the Indo-China situation. He talked about the possibilities of replacing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> with somebody else and stated that in the opinion of the French, he could not carry on and that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> had arrived at that conclusion. He emphasized that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> had changed his mind just recently and stated in effect that the position he had assumed in regard to <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Vien</persName> may have been too rigid. I accepted that statement but told him that in my opinion that if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> fell no one man could replace him out of the 4 or 5 being considered and that the result will be chaos and civil war and that the country would become an easy pray [<hi rend="italic">prey</hi>] to <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> and the communists. Evidently, he was here to pressure me into changing my position on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> but I still feel he is the only man who stands a chance and it is a long chance of keeping South Vietnam free. I was not surprised when Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Millet</persName> came here to see me although I was supposed to see the French Ambassador. It appears to me that the Administration in discussing the Indo-China situation with the French Ambassador here is in effect putting the major responsibility on me. As to what our future decision will be vis-à-vis the retention or overthrow of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> I pointed out to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Millet</persName> that the responsibility lay with the President and Secretary of State and that it was up to them to assume that responsibility. All I could do was to make my views known.</p>

<p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Walter</persName>: I refer to the current situation in South Vietnam and the probable necessity for review of the basic policy in that area.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_278" n="278" facs="0308"/>
<p>An analysis of the problems has been made by my staff in the attached staff study. I think it is an excellent study and I highly recommend you and your staff read it.</p>
<p>While I realize these problems have no easy solution, to me the basic issues are quite clear. I believe there are three major areas of weakness in South Vietnam as follows:</p>
<list>
<item>a. The need for a solution of the problem of how we can achieve our ends in South Vietnam and yet live with the French.</item>
<item>b. The need for a solution of how we can achieve internal order with particular reference to the sects, the lack of internal communications, and the lack of strength in the central government. (During my recent trip I conferred with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> at which time he stated that if his government could become strong he felt the people would rally to it, and that at present <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> offered the only strong rallying point to the people of South Vietnam.)</item>
<item>c. The need for a solution of how we can achieve a suitable government of South Vietnam, with particular reference to its relationship to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, the broadening of its base, and the participation of capable people within the government. (I feel that in the past we have made a mistake in building the government upon one man.)</item>
</list>
<p>In view of the probable nature of the problems to be discussed with <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> during his visit, I consider that this information may be of value to you.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>

<p rend="center">PROGRAMS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF U.S. POLICY TOWARDS SOUTH VIET-NAM</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Problem:</p>
<p>To re-examine current implementation of U.S. policy pertaining to South Viet-Nam in light of current events related to that area.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion:</p>
<p>Tab A.<note n="3" xml:id="d131fn3">Tab A was a 10-page study. For text, see <hi rend="italic">United States-Vietnam Relations, 1945–1967,</hi> Book 10, pp. 927–936.</note></p>
<pb xml:id="pg_279" n="279" facs="0309"/>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusions:</p>
<p>1. Interim or delaying actions in South Viet-Nam should be accompanied by development of a favorable situation in the remainder of the Far East in general and in Southeast Asia in particular as pertains to Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand.</p>
<p>2. The successful accomplishment of U.S. programs for South Viet-Nam cannot be assured through French implementation of such programs as the French will only accept the concept of these programs insofar as they further French policy in the area.</p>
<p>3. The influence of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> in his position as Chief of State is a constant menace to the successful implementation of U.S. programs in South Viet-Nam.</p>
<p>4. Alternatives to the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government should be given adequate consideration in the event the U.S. cannot longer reasonably support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>
<p>5. A strong, stable, viable government cannot be developed in South Viet-Nam until a reasonable solution to the problem of the Sects has been determined.</p>
<p>6. The Viet-Minh are capable, even without resorting to overt aggression, of preventing the total accomplishment of U.S. objectives in South Viet-Nam.</p>
<p>7. The military defense of Viet-Nam would be extremely difficult if not impossible should: The <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> withdraw from South Viet-Nam and no other forces be immediately available to fill the vacuum; the Viet-Minh then overtly intervene; and no U.S. ground forces be included in “other” forces ultimately used to fill the vacuum.</p>
<p>8. The loss of Viet-Nam and subsequent political developments would render the military defense of the remainder of Southeast Asia extremely difficult, if not impossible.</p>
<p>9. It is questionable that South Viet-Nam could at this time win an election pertaining to the unification of Viet-Nam.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendations:</p>
<p>1. Direct U.S. military aid and support programs at the rapid and efficient development of indigenous forces, particularly Thailand and Cambodia. Any U.S. military aid program in the latter should be contingent upon U.S. control of the organization and training of Cambodian forces.</p>
<p>2. Obtain a firm statement of French policy relating to Viet-Nam; inform the French that the U.S. will expect complete French support in the implementation of U.S. programs in South Viet-Nam.</p>
<p>3. Obtain from the Department of State an immediate and practical solution to the problem of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. (From a Defense point of <pb xml:id="pg_280" n="280" facs="0310"/>view, he should be a figurehead only, with a minimum amount of control over the Viet-Nam Government.)</p>
<p>4. Accept <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName>’ recommendations on alternatives to the current Vietnamese Government but make certain that the problem of the Sects is also considered concurrently.</p>
<p>5. Regardless of whether <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> or alternative government is in power, it should be understood that the Binh Xuyen will immediately be stripped of all power and subjugated to the National Government; that the government will include representation from the other Sects; and that these other Sects will eventually be completely subjugated to the National Government.</p>
<p>6. In re-evaluating current or establishing new U.S. objectives in South Viet-Nam insure adequate consideration of Viet-Minh capabilities rather than possible intentions.</p>
<p>7. Determine U.S. military action within the scope of the <gloss target="#t_SEACDT1">SEACDT</gloss> in order to prevent the loss of the remainder of Southeast Asia as a result of the loss of South Viet-Nam.</p>
<p>8. Make every effort to abolish or postpone indefinitely the elections proposed for Viet-Nam, under the Geneva Accords, for July 1956.</p>

<item>Report on Vietnamese Political Situation.</item>
</list>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">I. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName>’ Report</p>
<p>A. During two long meetings in the Department Friday,<note n="2" xml:id="d132fn2">April 22; another account of these meetings is printed <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</note> <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> vigorously reiterated his view that no solution in Viet-Nam is possible as long as <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> remains in office. He tried to convince <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to accept a compromise solution but he says <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> stubbornly refused to consider it. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> emphasized that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s inability to govern successfully was not due to lack of <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s support but to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s major incapacities to organize a following, handle men, delegate responsibility, concentrate on essential matters and come up <pb xml:id="pg_281" n="281" facs="0311"/>with ideas and suggestions. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Gen. Collins</persName> believes that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has no organized support and very little personal popularity except perhaps in Central Viet-Nam. While he acknowledges the many other factors in this situation, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Gen. Collins</persName> forcefully repeated his conclusion that some new arrangement is urgently required. He inclines to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> as successor which <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> has now formally proposed to us and probably the French (Para II A). The meetings Friday only began to explore various solutions and major procedural problems. No tentative recommendations were made.</p>
<p>While he has not fully agreed with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s estimate that a major military crisis might break out at any time, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Gen. Collins</persName> feels that the Saigon situation is tense enough that it could ignite quickly at any time. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Gen. Collins</persName> added two new interesting sidelights on his picture of the situation:</p>
<list>
<item>1) He said <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s brother, the Bishop, recently admitted to him the disproportionate influence of the other brothers on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, and the Bishop’s inability to dissuade <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> from listening to them almost exclusively. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Gen. Collins</persName> confirmed that there is widespread bitter opposition to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> because of his reliance on his brothers, other than the Bishop;</item>
<item>2) <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Gen. Collins</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Gen. Ely</persName> and the French have not denied the Vietnamese National Army ammunition or gasoline either on the night of March 28 or 29 when the Binh Xuyen attacked, or since. There has been a standing French offer to turn over additional ammunition depots to the Vietnamese army which it has so far not answered. While the French officers did try to stop the outbreak of fighting that night, it was to prevent the outbreak of civil war which <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> is convinced will occur if the national army drives the Binh Xuyen out of Saigon, which it can do.</item>
</list>
<p>B. At lunch with the President Friday noon, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Gen. Collins</persName> made a general report along the above lines.<note n="3" xml:id="d132fn3"><p>In a brief memorandum of April 23 to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> concerning this meeting <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> reported:</p>
<p>“The presentation by <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> closely followed discussions which he was having on the same date with members of the staff of the Department, which are being reported to you separately. I will therefore not outline them in this memorandum.</p>
<p>“No decisions were made and the entire matter is being held in abeyance pending further consideration by the Department, and your return.” (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/4–2355)</p>
<p>A memorandum of the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> meeting by <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName>, dated April 22, is in <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Library, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Staff Records, Disaster File, Vietnam.</p></note> The President reportedly emphasized the difficulties with respect to Congressional and public opinion in making any change in Saigon.</p>

<p rend="sectiontitleital">II Various Suggestions for Meeting Saigon Political Crisis</p>
<p>A. <hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s Plan:</hi> In a telegram from Paris April 21,<note n="4" xml:id="d132fn4">Telegram 4576 from Paris, April 21, reported telegraphically the information in <ref target="#d129">Document 129</ref>. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/4–2155)</note> <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> has proposed to us through a spokesman that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> be asked immediately to form a new government in conjunction with a new “Council of National Union”, both to be under the legal authority of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. The sects could be in the new Council but not in the cabinet which would include about twelve “technicians” acceptable to all factions, anti-Communists and competent for their jobs. The Council would have eighteen or twenty members representing all Vietnamese factions and groups except the Communists. Both Cabinet and Council would have real powers. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> would serve as arbitrator in any disputes between them. However, the Council would serve only until a National Assembly is established. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> is reported to have “settled on” this plan because he is convinced no solution is possible unless <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is removed at least temporarily and replaced as Prime Minister. He believes <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s plan of a provisional government and national election is “madness”. The U.S. must take no visible role in implementing his plan but he wants U.S. agreement to it in principle. He is prepared to make a formal commitment to us that he can put it into effect quickly. He will stake his personal prestige in assuring that the sects will agree (1) to incorporation of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> their forces into the national army, and (2) not to take part in the Cabinet but only in the Council. After securing this agreement from them, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> assures us he will obtain Binh Xuyen agreement to give up control of the national police force. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> believes <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> is the best qualified candidate to receive “passive” French-U.S. and “active” Vietnamese support to form a government of national union. He wants general U.S.-French approval for this plan but then both countries must withdraw from active role in forming the new government and influencing its daily activities. If U.S. insists on continuing with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and rejects his plan, he will no longer take any responsibility for events in Viet-Nam. He will do nothing further until he receives our reply. He emphasized need for prompt action.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> suggests we use this plan as a basis, although he recommends, among other things, the Council be advisory. Our discussions with him pointed up the danger that this plan would appear to be “made in France”.<note n="5" xml:id="d132fn5">This was <persName corresp="#p_KRA1">Kidder</persName>’s assessment as reported in telegram 4780 from Saigon, April 24.

(Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/4–2255)</note> His selection of a new Prime Minister would attach to anew man “the <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> stigma” To avoid this Stevenson suggests <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> name a new Premier to head an interim government pending elections of a national assembly which would then choose and submit to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> the name of a new prime minister.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> This is similar to the suggestion Department has been making and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> was exploring in Saigon before he returned, except that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would remain as interim head, pending a provisional assembly in early June. That arrangement with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> may have become impracticable.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Steps to be taken</p>
<p>We are preparing briefing papers<note n="9" xml:id="d132fn9">Not found in Department of State files.</note> for discussions with you Monday and Tuesday on the following major questions:</p>
<list>
<item>A. What should we say to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, if anything, before and if we decide on assenting to some new arrangement? Perhaps it would be the decent thing to do to have the U.S. Government tell <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> of the impasse that has been reached and of the necessity for the U.S. to look for some new arrangement, before we withdraw our support completely from him. This could be done by a message for <persName corresp="#p_KRA1">Kidder</persName> to deliver orally, by a personal note from you to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, or, if there were time, for <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> to deliver in person on his return.</item>
<item>B. What reply should be made to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and when? This is a difficult answer because it involves the entire picture of whether, on what terms and conditions, and when a new political composition should be attempted in Saigon through his auspices.</item>
<item>C. Is <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> the best available replacement for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and to what extent should the U.S. engage itself in <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>’s candidacy?</item>
<item>D. To what extent should and can <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> be kept on the scene in some new role, such as chairman of the National Council with some <pb xml:id="pg_284" n="284" facs="0314"/>major responsibility such as supervising the Free Vietnamese handling of consultations with the Viet Minh on the election problem, or giving special attention to the refugees, most of whom are Catholics.</item>
<item>E. Will it be possible to solve the possible dilemma that a <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> formula will seem to be foreign-inspired and unacceptable to that extent, while on the other hand the leading personalities in Saigon appear increasingly unable to compose their differences and come up with any formula on their own? This may mean that we will have to do a lot behind the scene to put the pieces together if that is possible. There is increasing mention in our telegrams that the Viet Minh may be playing a more active role as instigator and exploiter of the situation.</item>
<item>F. What role should <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> play?</item>
</list>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Gen. Collins</persName>’ Appointments</p>
<p>He is scheduled to have lunch with you Monday noon. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> is free to see him Monday morning or later Monday afternoon. Mr. Morton has tentatively set up appointments with Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> and Senator Fulbright and others on the Hill for Tuesday.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Department of State Debriefing of <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName></item>
</list>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> was debriefed by Department of State representatives, commencing at 1000 Friday, 22 April. Also present at this debriefing were representatives of Defense, <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>, and Treasury.</p>
<p>The problems discussed were primarily political in nature and the objective of the discussion was to arrive at a solution to the current governmental situation in South Viet-Nam. However, two problems of interest to the Department of Defense—financial support of the French Expeditionary Corps (<gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>) and integration of Sect forces into the Vietnamese National Army—were also discussed.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_285" n="285" facs="0315"/>
<p>In the political phase of the discussion, the various proposals which have been made during recent weeks were analyzed and the following points are considered to be of interest:</p>
<p>a. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> stated that:</p>
<list>
<item>(1) In his opinion it would be a major error in judgement to continue to support a man (<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>) who has demonstrated such a marked inability to understand the political, economic and military problems associated with Viet-Nam.</item>
<item>(2) <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is currently governing by himself, based on the advice of his brothers and a few close friends (Ministers of Justice, Finance, and Information).</item>
<item>(3) <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> simply cannot get along with other capable men.</item>
<item>(4) <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, in five months, has not had one original constructive suggestion, idea, or plan. Generals <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> have been responsible for any of these which appeared to originate with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</item>
<item>(5) Doctor <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> and former Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> are the most able men available in South Viet-Nam.</item>
<item>(6) General elections in South Viet-Nam are not possible and the best form of government for this country would be a constitutional monarchy. The Vietnamese are not, and will not be in the immediate future, ready for a republican form of government.</item>
<item>(7) Various plans which have been proposed for interim forms of governments, such as provisional or constituent assemblies, and including the plan of <persName corresp="#p_NVT2">Thoai</persName> (Minister for Planning and Reconstruction)<note n="2" xml:id="d133fn2"><persName corresp="#p_NVT2">Nguyen Van Thoai</persName>.</note> which was considered worthy of further study, are doomed to defeat as <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will not accept such recommendations.</item>
<item>(8) “<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has been informed by me that I don’t see how anyone can save his government and that I think that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> will remove him.”</item>
</list>
<p>b. In elaborating further on the situation in South Viet-Nam <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> stated that the <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> plan (<gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> Paris 4576<note n="3" xml:id="d133fn3">See <ref target="#d132fn4">footnote 4, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi></ref>.</note>) attached as Tab A is worthy of consideration and recommends that the U.S. concur in its implementation. Based on this statement, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>, State, commented that for a time it appeared that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was developing successfully according to <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName>’ reports but that <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> had now reversed his position. In response, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> stated that he had never indicated that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was indispensable. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> further stated that this was the best we could hope to obtain as pertains to a Vietnamese-conceived plan and that practically any plan was going to be saddled, propaganda-wise, with the stigma of French or U.S. conception.</p>
<p>c. In a further discussion between Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> the problem of the fighting between the Sects and the National Army was developed and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> stated:</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_286" n="286" facs="0316"/>
<list>
<item>(1) The U.S. is just now beginning to train the Vietnamese National Army and a senior Vietnamese Army officer stated that they had no desire to fight other Vietnamese (Sects).</item>
<item>(2) <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName> (Army Chief of Staff) told <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> he would not order an attack on the Sects.</item>
<item>(3) The French will not, except to protect their own people, use French troops against the Sects. Their primary mission is one of external security.</item>
<item>(4) The bitter feud between <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> originated in <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s closing of the “Grande Monde”.</item>
<item>(5) Practically all Vietnamese now disagree with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</item>
<item>(6) Some compromise will be necessary on the part of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s replacement.</item>
<item>(7) The Binh Xuyen are not in a strong military position.</item>
<item>(8) <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> and the Sects will accept the concept of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s plan.</item>
<item>(9) <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> will surrender the control of the police if ordered to do so by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is replaced.</item>
<item>(10) Although an effort must be made to give <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> an opportunity to save face, the Binh Xuyen must be stripped of their power.</item>
<item>(11) Based on the above, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> considered that there were only two solutions to this problem—acceptance of the proposal of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, or for <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> to return and assume the Premiership. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> did not consider the latter as a desirable solution.</item>
</list>
<p>d. In response to a question, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> stated that the current situation in South Viet-Nam was definitely not engineered by the French. He further stated that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> has given <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> unequivocal support. However, he could not speak for French support from Paris. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> emphasized that civil war could break out at any moment and that either side could be responsible.</p>
<p>e. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> stated that the U.S. has a moral obligation in relation to the 500,000 Vietnamese refugees and that it would be difficult for the U.S. to withdraw from Viet-Nam.</p>
<p>f. In reference to the <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> mission, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> stated that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> has threatened to resign over this issue. He indicated that the French business people have not adjusted to the concept of a Free Viet-Nam. He thought that the French would just as soon see an indefinite partition of Viet-Nam but that the U.S. should force the issue of French support for a legally constituted Vietnamese Government.</p>
<p>With reference to the two problems primarily of military interest, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> stated that:</p>
<p>a. We should not provide one nickel more than the 100 million dollars currently available for support of the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>. They might reduce their forces but would not withdraw.</p>
<p>b. The current dispositions of the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> are sound.</p>
<p>c. The <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> is a strong, stabilizing influence in South Viet-Nam.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_287" n="287" facs="0317"/>
<p>d. Implementation of Article IV of the Manila Pact would require ground forces to stabilize the front and give the U.S. Air and Navy forces something to shoot at.</p>
<p>e. Air and Naval forces will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> alone result in a victory in this area in the event of overt aggression.</p>
<p>f. Integration of Sect forces as he has proposed (DA IN 130977) (Tab B)<note n="4" xml:id="d133fn4">Not printed.</note> has now been agreed to by the French.</p>
<p>g. This integration will now cost approximately 40 million dollars rather than the 26 million as previously stated.</p>
<p>h. This plan for integration will eventually provide for a reduction in Sect power.</p>
<p>In summary, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> is firmly convinced that it will be to the detriment of U.S. interests to continue to support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. However, State is reluctant to face the fact that they must admit a failure in U.S. policy and obviously will attempt to retain <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in the Government in some capacity.</p>

<p rend="center">VIET-NAM</p>
<p>a) Risks of some outbreak of civil war in South Viet-Nam still great and impose need for very urgent action.</p>
<p>b) Root of trouble is that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s prolonged attempt to run a one-man government has destroyed his chances of ever securing the collaboration of other prominent Vietnamese personalities. There has been a steady build-up of intellectual opinion against him. He has got nowhere with his own efforts to form a government worth anything.</p>
<p>c) Public opinion in Great Britain, as elsewhere, is unlikely to view intervention by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> with any enthusiasm.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_288" n="288" facs="0318"/>
<p>d) But <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> represents the only constitutional method of dealing with the situation (cf. appeals from the Sects, senior army officers and even <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName>, which show that Vietnamese themselves recognize this).</p>
<p>e) Therefore, given this constitutional position and urgency, there seems no alternative to an intervention by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. He is needed as a catalyst.</p>
<p>2. Therefore . . .<note n="2" xml:id="d134fn2">Ellipsis in the source text.</note></p>
<p>a) An immediate approach should be made to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> asking him to take the initiative in bringing about a solution.</p>
<p>b) <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> should not be encouraged to return in person to Viet-Nam (he probably does not wish to at present).</p>
<p>c) In tackling <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, care must be taken to avoid the imputation of foreign pressure.</p>
<p>3. a) The type of solution which should be sought is the setting up of a temporary government with or without <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, pending the establishment of a national assembly.</p>
<p>b) Even by using <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, it might prove impossible to get the other parties and intellectual personalities to accept <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, even as a temporary measure. This possibility must be faced. Their acceptance might be obtained if solid guarantees were given that the government to be formed would be of strictly limited duration.</p>
<p>c) If <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> fails, this must appear as being due to his political isolation and not represented as a victory for the Sects or French opinion.</p>
<p>d) If it can possibly be achieved, the request for <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s intervention should be agreed upon by the Vietnamese in Saigon and put to him by the parties from there. If this cannot be achieved, it might prove necessary for a meeting to take place in France.</p>

<item>Conversation Today with <persName corresp="#p_FWR1">Wesley Fishel</persName></item>
</list>
<pb xml:id="pg_289" n="289" facs="0319"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_FWR1">Fishel</persName> said that he had received a long cable from <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> the day before yesterday which was surprisingly optimistic. In the cable he said (1) he was proclaiming his general election three months from now; (2) there is clear evidence that the Binh Xuyen are losing ground daily. He said that there have been over a thousand defections with arms from that group and over a hundred from the Hoa Hao. The latter has been badly split and pay for the men was now only 45 piasters a month, whereas previously they had been getting 350 a month; (3) the National Army has extremely high morale, even fanatical, and he is confident that the Army will follow him against the Binh Xuyen and against <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName>.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_FWR1">Fishel</persName> believes that the latest difficulty is unquestionably related to the change of government in Paris and that the principal cause of trouble is with our ally France, no question of that. They are determined to get <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> out. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>, he says, is half-way on their side at the moment.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_FWR1">Fishel</persName> thought it highly important that you talk to a Vietnamese who has just arrived in this country from Paris, Vo Lang. He will be in Washington tomorrow and is leaving on Wednesday. Vo Lang is Director of Cabinet for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s brother who is Ambassador in Paris,<note n="2" xml:id="d135fn2">Probably a reference to <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Ngo Dinh Luyen</persName>, then an Ambassador at Large.</note> and in <persName corresp="#p_FWR1">Fishel</persName>’s opinion, very competent and reliable.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_FWR1">Fishel</persName> thought that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s brother’s wife who has gotten in the news recently has no influence at all on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. She is very vivacious and a fanatic nationalist, but doesn’t influence him one bit. However, <persName corresp="#p_FWR1">Fishel</persName> thinks one of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s brothers is seen too much by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. While that brother’s influence is only partial, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is listening to him more than he should, and he is a defeatist.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_FWR1">Fishel</persName> thinks <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will make it if he has American support. He thought your recent remarks<note n="3" xml:id="d135fn3">According to <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi> of April 22, <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> was “on record as urging the total suspension of United States aid to South Vietnam if its Premier is overthrown.”</note> were very timely and good.<note n="4" xml:id="d135fn4">The following note appears at the bottom of the source text: “I had a second call from <persName corresp="#p_FWR1">Fishel</persName> on the 26th re possible talk with Vo Lang. He will be in Washington on the 27th and will call.”</note></p>

<p>Bill Gibson telephoned me at 4:00 p.m. to say that they had delivered the Department’s message<note n="2" xml:id="d136fn2">Transmitted in telegram 3803 to Paris, April 25. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/4–2555)</note> to Nguyen De this morning requesting <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> not to take any action pending <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName>’ return.<note n="3" xml:id="d136fn3">A more detailed account of this Gibson–Nguyen De discussion is in telegram 4659 from Paris, April 26.

Nguyen De telephoned the message to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s reaction was completely unfavorable. He appreciated our feelings but told Nguyen De that the situation is becoming so desperate that he must take action by tomorrow evening, that is Wednesday evening Paris time. Bill Gibson indicated he felt <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> is worried about his own situation in letting affairs move on without taking the initiative himself.</p>
<p>The Ambassador talked very strongly to Nguyen De who decided to go to Cannes immediately. The argument that <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> is returning to Saigon and that we have a very great interest in this affair seemed the strongest point with Nguyen De and <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. Bill Gibson says that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> may come around and hold off. Nguyen De will give <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s reconsideration and his answer to the Embassy Wednesday morning Paris time.</p>
<p>Bill wanted to know when we might have some instructions to Paris.<note n="4" xml:id="d136fn4"><ref target="#d140">Document 140</ref>.</note> I said fairly soon, but urged him not to mention any particular day this week to the Vietnamese or to the French.

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Viet-Nam Situation, Noon, April 27, 1955</item>
</list>
<p>1. The situation remains very tense in Saigon with both the Binh Xuyen and the Army alerted and prepared. The truce is presumed to continue to May 1. All elements sense that the situation is approaching some new turn. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> has told us he intends to take action not later than Thursday, April 28, to remove <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and appoint a new Prime Minister, but so far we have urged him to wait.</p>
<p>2. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> appears determined to hold out. He has issued a decree relieving the Binh Xuyen police chief and installing his own man as successor.<note n="2" xml:id="d138fn2">According to telegram 4844 from Saigon, April 27, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s office issued a communiqué on April 26 replacing <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Lai Van Sang</persName>, Director General of National Police and Sûreté, with Colonel Nguyen Ngoc Le. Telegram 4844 also reported that <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> declared over United Front radio on the evening of April 26 that he would stay on at his post since he could only be removed by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> Central Files, 751G.00/4–2755)</note> However, he has made no move to seize the National <pb xml:id="pg_292" n="292" facs="0322"/>Police Building, where the Binh Xuyen continue to operate. So far there has been no overt Binh Xuyen reaction. Although <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> appears to be operating a one-man government and his government programs are at a standstill, there have been some very recent slight indications that certain elements of importance in the local political scene are tending to move away from the “united front” of the sects and to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. Presumably, United States delay in acceding to a removal of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> may be having some effect in the latter’s favor. Nevertheless, his political position seems to deteriorate steadily.</p>
<p>3. The French continue, both in Paris and in Saigon, to favor the removal of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> as soon as possible. However, they are apparently unwilling to indicate a choice for a successor without prior consultation with us. They may wish to defer decisions on a successor to joint <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> recommendation. There are some indications that an increasingly influential French element now considers the <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> policy in the North to have been a failure, and this element may be gradual, more amenable, to the objectives of building a strong government in the South and delaying the 1956 elections as long as possible.</p>
<p>4. Our present course of action in outgoing telegrams is (a) accept <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> estimate <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> cannot be supported any longer (b) new government would have fair prospects and chance is worth taking (c) obtain assurances from French, and (d) authorize <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> help resolve political crisis.</p>

<p rend="center">SUMMARY OF REMARKS OF <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">GENERAL LAWTON COLLINS</persName></p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> reviewed the situation in south Viet Nam. He said that after months of attempting to work with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> he had reached the conclusion that the Premier did not have the executive ability to handle “strong-willed men”, that he concerns himself with minor matter[s] and has not originated a single constructive <pb xml:id="pg_293" n="293" facs="0323"/>idea since he came to power. Able men in the cabinet had been alienated by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s habit of going over their heads, according to <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName>, and he paid little attention to their views, preferring instead to rely on two brothers and a number of “yes men”[.]</p>
<p>There was no question according to <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s honesty, anti-communism and anti-colonialism, but he is so completely uncompromising, acetic [<hi rend="italic">ascetic</hi>] and monastic that he cannot deal with realities like the Binh Xuyen and the Cao Dai. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has incurred the undying enmity of <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> for the manner in which he closed the gambling houses in Saigon.</p>
<p>Between <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and himself, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> believes there is a chance to rescue the situation. It requires an able Premier, not in any way identified with the French, and absolute pledges from the French that they will go along positively with independence. They have not always done that in the past. This added to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s many other problems but according to <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> has not been the decisive difficulty. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> believes there are able modern-minded men like <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> who could sit around the table and talk with any of us, talk our language, or <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Tran Van Do</persName> who could handle the job of premier.</p>
<p>The General expressed the belief that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> should neither be brought back to Saigon at this time or eliminated from the picture entirely. He stretched his background and indicated that he was the thread of legitimacy. In the General’s view, a political solution in the area called for a constitutional monarch.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> thought there was not the slightest possibility of an invasion by the Viet Minh at this time. According to reports, they are having serious difficulties in the north due to a poor rice crop which has brought a threat of large-scale famine, and because the people have had an opportunity to see how they operate. They have levied a confiscatory tax which has fallen heavily on the Indian merchants in the north with the result that prices are rising rapidly. <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> has not been able to get a single contract from the Viet Minh.</p>
<p>The Chinese are aiding the Viet Minh. Technicians are now manning the Hanoi airport and they have restored one railroad to the Chinese border.</p>

<p>3828. For Ambassador.</p>
<p>1. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss> only: After full consultations here with <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> it appears that some change in political arrangements in Viet-Nam may be inevitable. However, our general position remains that we continue support legal government under Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> until Vietnamese nationalist elements evolve another formula warranting continued U.S. assistance and support. If this becomes impossible, U.S. will have to reconsider its policy in Viet-Nam.</p>
<p>2. Immediate and urgent next step is to determine fundamental French policies, and if possible develop U.S.-French concert of views before approaching <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and Vietnamese in Saigon. Essential purpose is to obtain unequivocal French assurances for full backing any new political arrangements in Saigon. Therefore we wish you would immediately see Prime Minister and Foreign Minister to give them orally the points outlined in paragraph 7 and obtain their views and oral assurances of concurrence.</p>
<p>3. We feel very strongly we should obtain adequate French assurances because of evident past lack of coordination between <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s view in Saigon and French view in Paris, and because of Congressional anxiety and concern revealed in <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ consultations with leaders this week. They will be perturbed over possible replacement of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, repercussions in Viet-Nam, and implications of French policy in North and South Viet-Nam. Unless we can give Congressional leaders some assurances on French intentions, there is bound to be difficulty in getting Congressional support for continued aid for <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> and Viet-Nam.</p>
<p>4. Part of the cause for failure of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has been absence of whole-hearted French action to carry out paragraph 4 of September 29, 1954, minute of understanding.<note n="2" xml:id="d140fn2"><p>Paragraph 4 of the minute of understanding agreed to during conversations between Acting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SWB1">Walter Bedell Smith</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_LCGC1">Guy La Chambre</persName>, then Minister of Associated States, and <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Edgar Faure</persName>, then Finance Minister, September 27–29, 1954, reads as follows:</p>
<p>“With respect to Vietnam, representatives of France and United States agree their respective governments support M. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> in establishment and maintenance of a strong, anti-Communist and nationalist government. To this end France and the United States will urge all anti-Communist elements in Vietnam cooperate fully with Government of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> in order counter vigorously the Viet Minh and build a strong free Vietnam.”</p>
<p>For complete text of the minute, see <gloss target="#t_Tosec1">Tosec</gloss> 8, September 30, 1954, <ref target="frus1952-54v13p2"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, vol. XIII, Part 2</ref>, p. 2100.</p></note> Ambiguities of French policy <pb xml:id="pg_295" n="295" facs="0325"/>vis-à-vis north and south have impeded effective political development in Free Viet-Nam. Unless these are removed and basic French intentions toward support for Viet-Nam are clear, any Vietnamese Government will not be successful and U.S. support will have to be reexamined. We desire Embassy make these views clear to French and make every attempt to secure frank and full statement of French intentions in Viet-Nam, north and south.</p>
<p>5. In presenting the points contained below you should point out orally to the French that, with respect to the continuation of the delegation general in Hanoi, we would hope that <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> would not return to Hanoi following the final evacuation of French forces from Haiphong in May. <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName>, rightly or wrongly, has become symbol of “double-dealing”. Any residual French delegation in Hanoi should be proportionate to the remaining French interests there and perhaps serve in a consular capacity.</p>
<p>6. We prefer you receive acceptable French reactions to paragraph seven before giving them our views on questions regarding the character and procedures of a new government. They are transmitted in subsequent telegram. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
<p>7. We have carefully studied the French aide-mémoire of April</p>
<p>17, 1955, containing the French response to the questions posed by the United States Government with respect to the political situation in Free Viet-Nam.<note n="3" xml:id="d140fn3">See <ref target="#d117">Documents 117</ref> and <ref target="#d122">122</ref>.</note> Before proceeding to take up specific questions of procedure and personalities, we would appreciate clarification of certain aspects of French policy toward Indochina. This is of fundamental importance, since it now appears that it may be difficult to secure continued Congressional support for large-scale financial assistance to the French Expeditionary Corps and Viet-Nam unless certain apparent ambiguities are removed.</p>
<p>A. Accordingly, we believe the following are basic desiderata and we would appreciate <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName>’s agreement to them:</p>
<list>
<item>1) The desirability of continuing to assist in developing and strengthening Free Viet-Nam following the principles of the Franco-American Minute of Understanding of September 29, 1954. The question of personalities is to be dealt with separately;</item>
<item>2) The desirability of giving full moral and political support to the established and recognized Government of Viet-Nam in maintaining its authority and exercising legitimate functions of upholding law and order; and</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_296" n="296" facs="0326"/>
<item>3) The desirability of limiting French representation in North Viet-Nam to the extent necessary to represent residual French interests following the withdrawal of French forces from the Haiphong area in May 1955.</item>
</list>
<p>B. If the French agree to the above, we are prepared to discuss possible steps to seek to resolve the political crises in Free Viet-Nam. In our view the establishment of any new Vietnamese government should be subject to the following considerations:</p>
<list>
<item>1) It should have recognized administrative and political capabilities and unquestionable nationalist orientation.</item>
<item>2) Any new Vietnamese government would be provisional in character until a fully elected national assembly is constituted.</item>
<item>3) It should so far as practicable result from a genuinely Vietnamese nationalist initiative not bearing the stamp “made in Cannes, Paris or Washington”.</item>
<item>4) Police power must be transferred to the central government and the allegiance of the sects to the new cabinet assured.</item>
<item>5) <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> should participate in the establishment of any new government to the extent of bringing the Binh Xuyen into line, designating a generally-accepted person as Prime Minister with full powers.</item>
<item>6) The seven-point reform program developed by the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government with the assistance of <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> must be energetically carried out.</item>
<item>7) Full support must be given to a program for the integration of the sects and the Binh Xuyen into the modern life of Viet-Nam.</item>
<item>8) An effort must be made to find some important and useful role for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in order to utilize his political assets and good qualities, and both Governments should urge him to accept some new participation to further the cause of Free Viet-Nam. His refusal however would not hold up subsequent procedures.</item>
</list>
<p>We would appreciate confirmation French authorities accept the points in this understanding.</p>
<p>8. Embassy Saigon inform <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> of full paragraph 7 above.</p>

<p>3829, For the Ambassador. If the French agree to para. 7 <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 4756,<note n="2" xml:id="d141fn2">Printed as telegram 3828 to Paris, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> then you may give them orally the following views on procedures and a new government. Our views are based on consultations with <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName>, a careful study of the French aide-mémoire of April 17, 1955, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s proposals, and the views of various Vietnamese in Saigon.</p>
<p>A. Our tentative proposals on procedures are as follows:</p>
<list>
<item>1) The U.S. will have to maintain position of full support for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> until and unless Vietnamese leaders develop alternate proposal which <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> would support.</item>
<item>2) <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> should be informed by both governments that before we would consider support for any change he must guarantee that he will confirm Prime Minister’s authority over police officials, the Binh Xuyen will be removed from police functions, and sûreté, and that the sects will agree to a broad program of their integration into the national life of Vietnam on the basis of “a single nation, a single state, a single army, and a single administration”. Such decree by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> must be in process before <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> leaves and new Prime Minister installed, to prevent clear Binh Xuyen “victory” over <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> which would rise to plague successor.</item>
<item>3) If <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> gives adequate assurances, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> should immediately help the Vietnamese work out the new alignment, urge <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to serve in a new capacity, if he will, and provide full support for the new government. If <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> refuses, the program should nevertheless be carried out anyway.</item>
<item>4) While the Vietnamese in Saigon should be the framers of a new government, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> will probably have to be in practice the catalysts. This may result in stories regarding a new <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> “formula” but we should make every attempt to keep the Vietnamese label.</item>
<item>5) <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> should inform <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that as a result of his inability to create a broadly based coalition government, and because of Vietnamese resistance to him, their governments are no longer in positions to attempt to prevent his removal from office. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s patriotic qualities are of great potential value to Vietnam and it is hoped he will lend his services to any new government which might be appointed.</item>
<item>6) <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> together speaking for their governments may be able to elicit formula outlined sub-para 4 above from Vietnamese political leaders behind the scenes. If those leaders, including <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> if practicable, adopt such a formula, they could ask <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> to counter-sign it. <pb xml:id="pg_298" n="298" facs="0328"/>If the Vietnamese consulted cannot agree among themselves on a candidate, then <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> will have to recommend a name for <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> to designate to form a new government under the proper terms and conditions.</item>
</list>
<p>B. Our tentative proposals on a new government are as follows:</p>
<list>
<item>1) Cabinet: The executive authority of full powers with <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> as president and vice president, respectively, composed of small nucleus of most able nationalist leaders. It would be highly desirable if the cabinet itself could include some from <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s cabinet and some new faces. It would operate as an interim coalition government until a fully elected National Assembly is constituted. The immediate tasks of the new cabinet would be (a) resolution of sect problem, (b) completion of reform of the armed forces and police, (c) satisfactory resettlement of present and future refugees, (d) energetic political program in provinces, (e) more active international policy in Southeast Asia, and (f) consultation with the Viet Minh on Geneva elections in 1956 and preparations for elections and a constituent assembly in Free Viet-Nam at some time.</item>
<item>2) Consultative Council: An advisory body of 25–35 leading personalities and group representatives, including the sects. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should be persuaded if possible to accept the chairmanship of this council. Its principal function would be to generate spirit of unity and cooperation among the people and groups throughout Free Viet-Nam. At the request of the president or the cabinet, it would advise the president and cabinet on major matters of state. It should have no executive or administrative functions. It should continue until the constitution of a permanent structure of government by a constituent assembly.</item>
<item>3) Provisional National Assembly: This quasi-legislative body of elected and appointed candidates already envisaged and scheduled to be set up should be formed and convoked as soon as possible once a new cabinet is in office. It would review the budget and designate a special committee to draft plans for a constituent assembly.</item>

<p>According to first-hand reports from Saigon, skirmishing between the Vietnamese National Army (<gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss>) and the Binh Xuyen—similar to that which had occurred sporadically during the past few days—began at midday (Saigon time) April 28 in the Saigon–Cholon <pb xml:id="pg_300" n="300" facs="0330"/>area. At 12:15 p.m. mortars fired by an unknown group landed in a nearby Binh Xuyen-controlled area wounding six or seven French soldiers guarding an electric power plant. Then at 1:15 p.m. the Binh Xuyen shelled the Presidential Palace with mortar rounds. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, who was in residence at the Palace, telephoned <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and informed him that if the shelling did not stop, he would order the <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> to return fire. The shelling attack continued and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> sent the army into action. Heavy fighting continued during the afternoon. Reports of the outbreak of fighting are in telegrams 4860 and 4881 from Saigon and telegram MC 976–55 from the United States Army Attaché in Saigon, April 28. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/4–2855)</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName> was in close contact with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> during the afternoon of April 28. For his account of the fighting and the immediate events surrounding it, see <hi rend="italic">In the Midst of Wars</hi>, pages 282–291.</p>

<p>“Re Vietnam—the Sec. told <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> to send a cable to block the cables we sent to Saigon and Paris.

<p>“C. returned the call and the Sec. said things seem to be heating up in Vietnam. C. said apparently so from the radio.

<head>145. Editorial Note</head>
<p>In a telegram of April 28, 8:48 a.m. Saigon time, <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Edward G. Lansdale</persName>, as head of the Saigon Military Mission (<gloss target="#t_SMM1">SMM</gloss>), sent to Washington a telegram in which he argued than the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government represented a better chance for success than any non-Viet Minh government it would be possible to form in South Vietnam. <pb xml:id="pg_302" n="302" facs="0332"/>Failure to support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would cause great damage to American prestige and would doom any successor government to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s to failure. The only winners would be the Viet Minh. According to the cable, new facts arising from the fighting in Saigon warranted calling a country-team meeting, and <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName> asked for such a meeting.</p>
<p>In response, Washington sent a telegram, April 27, 9:49 p.m., asking for the background to <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName>’s conclusion by 8 a.m. Washington time April 28 for use at the National Security Council meeting of that date. The 13-hour difference between Washington and Saigon accounts for the receipt of <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName>’s initial telegram in local time the day before it was sent.</p>
<p>As requested the Saigon Military Mission sent a fuller exposition of its estimate of the present situation in South Vietnam in another telegram on April 28, 8:44 p.m. Saigon time. The Mission stated that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was playing for time and awaiting Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ return to Saigon. Establishment of anew sûreté, reshuffling the cabinet, and calling for elections was not, in the Saigon Military Mission’s view, a solution to the basic security problem posed by the Binh Xuyen or the question of French support for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s present strategy was to allow support for the Binh Xuyen to erode and eventually collapse rather than risk an all-out military confrontation with the Binh Xuyen or a political solution with <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName>. While this policy conformed with the desires of <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName> and the Saigon Military Mission did not believe it would succeed, but rather would cause continued deterioration of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s position.</p>
<p>The reasons for this pessimistic estimate were twofold: the new cabinet would be no more effective than the old and the tensions, which were building up in Saigon because of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s lack of initiative and forthright action, were sure to increase. According to <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s basic problem was that he was not in control; he was outgunned by <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and the French Expeditionary Corps. As a result, anti-French feelings in Saigon–Cholon and throughout Vietnam were reaching serious proportions. If <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> replaced <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, the mission foresaw the probability of serious anti-French outbreaks. Under these conditions it was unlikely that any other nationalist candidate could carry out the programs necessary for success in Vietnam.</p>
<p>The Saigon Military Mission outlined in this estimate three possible alternatives. Under the first, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> bending to heavy French pressure would replace <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> with a candidate more acceptable to Paris. The result would be disastrous. Under the second alternative, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would be forced to maintain his position as leader of Vietnamese nationalist elements by adopting an openly anti-French posture and/or sending the Vietnamese National Army against the Binh Xuyen. The third possibility had nationalist elements in Vietnam undertaking sporadic and uncontrolled action—probably violent—against <pb xml:id="pg_303" n="303" facs="0333"/>the Binh Xuyen and/or French civilian and military personnel.</p>
<p>The Saigon Military Mission added that if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> were ousted from office, he planned to stay in Vietnam to head a political party to contest elections for the provisional assembly. The mission observed that if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> became openly anti-French—as no doubt he would if forced out of power by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and the French—he would be a powerful political factor because of his political support in central Vietnam and among northern refugees. Under this alternative, the future political climate of Vietnam would be anti-French and permeated by the Viet Minh.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName> concluded with a restatement of the recommendations in his initial telegram of April 28: no nationalist aspirant for power in Vietnam had as much to offer as <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and no pro-French leader could succeed against the Viet Minh. Any successor government to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s acceptable to the French would be unable to carry out the reforms essential to deny Vietnam to the Communists. As a result. United States prestige in Vietnam would seriously decrease and the United States could not be a major factor in supporting such a government, which, lacking popular support, would be forced to depend heavily upon the French.

<p>I.</p>
<p>1. At 1800 hours April 28 I saw <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> who states day’s episodes are what he feared would result from unresolved political situation. Without saying so directly he clearly indicated he felt a large measure of blame lies on United States for not having agreed to some political solution problem two or three weeks ago.</p>
<p>2. Although <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> has not gotten full reports of day’s events as yet, following is his best estimate of what took place. Local incident occurred 1115 Rue Petrushky in Cholon, resulting in 20 to 30 casualties. At 1215 several mortar shells fell in Binh Xuyen area near “Y” Bridge wounding, incidentally, 6 or 7 French soldiers who guarding <pb xml:id="pg_304" n="304" facs="0334"/>electric light plant in area. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> says he does not know who responsible for firing these shells. It might have been someone such as Mai Huun Xuan, chief Military Security, or some group wishing provoke trouble. He nevertheless holds <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> responsible as Prime Minister, and asks, with some reason, what possible advantage <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> could hope derive from starting trouble at this juncture. At 1315 Binh Xuyen fired on Palace as reported reference telegram.</p>
<p>3. Shortly before 1400 <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> telephoned <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> to inform him that if shelling continued he would command his troops to go into action. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> states that he warned <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> of the grave responsibility which he would be taking if he gave such an order; <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> would have no choice but hold <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> responsible for bloodshed which would result. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> did not comment in return.</p>
<p>4. According to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DVMC1">Colonel Minh</persName>,<note n="3" xml:id="d146fn3"><persName corresp="#p_DVMC1">Duong Van Minh</persName>.</note> Commanding Officer First Military District, ordered his troops remain on defensive but <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> went over <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName>’s head and ordered them into action. Whether troops actually initiated and carried out such action not clear at time of conversation with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>.</p>
<p>5. In discussing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, whom <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> qualifies as hysterical and beyond point of reason, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> himself verges on hysterics and becomes highly excited. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> states that if he does not get instructions of some kind looking towards political solution of problem by April 29 he will have to inform Paris he can no longer be responsible for what may happen. He states he has already warned Paris several times and that he would, of course, remain at his post, but that responsibility for developments could no longer be placed on his shoulders.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>1. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> showed me copies of two telegrams allegedly received yesterday: (a) A telegram from Nguyen De to Imperial Cabinet Sagion, in which De told addressees to tell <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Lai Van Sang</persName> that contrary to what he had learned, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> had taken no decision and had not given his agreement to measure concerning <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName>. Telegram continued “We count on Imperial decision within very short delay to put end to the present situation in Vietnam.”</p>
<p>(b) Telegram to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> from <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> states he has received protests from <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> and from sects against <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s action in which his attention called to serious disorders which might result very shortly from <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s measure. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> said he had ordered sects and <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> refrain from violence and respect truce:</p>
<list><item>“I request you (<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>) henceforth to take no measure whatsoever susceptible of counteracting the policy of appeasement which I have decided apply. No measure of this sort should be taken without your having referred to me in advance.”</item></list>
<pb xml:id="pg_305" n="305" facs="0335"/>
<p>(c) <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> points out <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> in his message being very cunning as he does not withdraw <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s order replacing <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName>. In this way <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> can profit from fact <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has removed <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName> without at same time involving himself in responsibility therefor.</p>
<p>2. As incidental information, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> informed me he had obtained copy of telegram sent to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> shortly after fighting of March 29 in which <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> that he, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, had been responsible for stopping fighting that night in spite desire Army continue.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>1. Question of responsbility for day’s episode obviously of great importance. We so far have no information which would enable us contradict <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s version. Colonel <persName corresp="#p_TVD2">Don</persName><note n="4" xml:id="d146fn4"><persName corresp="#p_TVD2">Tran Van Don</persName>.</note> of <gloss target="#t_FAVN1">FAVN</gloss> has informed <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName> that trouble started when Binh Xuyen fired on truckload of <gloss target="#t_FAVN1">FAVN</gloss> soldiers. We will look into this and other allegations as soon as possible in attempt get to bottom of matter.</p>

<p><persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Ken Young</persName> reports the following.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName> apparently has not been cut in on the <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> plan. His directives and his reports are therefore in the context of knowing only the “support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>” policy. He has been more recently reporting the wildfire rumor and speculation which has resulted from reports that the US may be shifting from <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>
<p>Late yesterday he sent a flood of reports and recommendations<note n="2" xml:id="d147fn2">For a summary of two principal recommendations, see <ref target="#d145">Document 145</ref>.</note> the gist of which were that the present would be a fatal moment to get rid of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, that nobody but the Viet Minh could gain and he recommended that a “country team” be formed in Saigon to evaluate the situation.<note n="3" xml:id="d147fn3">In a telegram, April 28, 7:51 p.m. Saigon time, secret and priority, <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName> reported that he had suggested that the country team report its recommendations separately, but that <persName corresp="#p_KRA1">Kidder</persName>, the Acting Chief of Mission, was not keen to do so. In a telegram, April 28, 7:46 p.m. Saigon time, secret and operational immediate, <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName> reported that he had specifically asked <persName corresp="#p_KRA1">Kidder</persName> to hold a country team meeting, but that <persName corresp="#p_KRA1">Kidder</persName> was unwilling to do so. <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName> also reported that Frank Meloy, chief of the Embassy’s political section, who was present, accused <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName> of attempting to use the country team to oppose <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>. (<gloss target="#t_SMM1">SMM</gloss> telegrams)</note> He reported unanimity of view in this regard including <pb xml:id="pg_306" n="306" facs="0336"/>Embassy but was ambiguous as to whether he referred to the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> matter or to the need for a country team.</p>
<p>Receipt of these reports . . . meant a rapid series of telephone calls last night from Aurell to Roosevelt (acting for <persName corresp="#p_WFG1">Wisner</persName>), to <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>, to <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>, to the Secretary, to <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Ken Young</persName>. The result was a stay order on Paris<note n="4" xml:id="d147fn4">Printed as telegram 3837 to Paris, <ref target="#d144">Document 144</ref>.</note> not to embark on the course of action agreed to late yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>The gist of the <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName> reports—apparently carefully evaluating those from pro-<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> sources—are as follows:</p>
<list>
<item>1. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has a head of steam up, would resist any <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> effort to remove him, will name tonight a “Cabinet of intellectuals”. (<persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName> indicating that in talking with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> he had urged broadest possible base for this Cabinet but had an unresponsive reaction from <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.)</item>
<item>2. The morale of the National Army is high.</item>
<item>3. Increasing indication that Binh Xuyen, while the leadership is making threats of strong action, at the functionary level is beginning to show signs of weakening and possible willingness to accommodate the Government.</item>
</list>
<p>In terms of policy the immediate decision is whether or not to go ahead with the course of action with respect to France first and thence Vietnam which had been agreed upon. This in the face of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> on the one hand and [?] quite likely to issue an edict firing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and instituting the <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> plan and on the other hand <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> naming a new Cabinet and showing firm resistance to the Binh Xuyen and any move of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>.</p>
<p>In terms of intelligence it means a clarification of the views of . . . field, Embassy, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_SPJ1">Sturm</persName> and Department particularly with respect to (1) this afternoon’s fighting and apparent success of the Army over Binh Xuyen; (2) Binh Xuyen steadfastness; (3) <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s steadfastness. (<persName corresp="#p_SPJ1">Sturm</persName> apparently feels strongly that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should and would retire to a monastery whereas . . . reports, again evaluated by source which is often pro-<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, indicate increasing vigor of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and the present Department policy which looks to a retention of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> for the time being with a phasing out only when alternatives have been agreed upon even then with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> holding a high position [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>].<note n="5" xml:id="d147fn5">The source text does not indicate where the parenthesis should end.</note></p>

<p><persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName>, accompanied by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPJ1">Paul J. Sturm</persName> of the State Department, entered the Cabinet Room when Item 5 came up for discussion. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> also asked permission for Mr. Kermit Roosevelt of the Central Intelligence Agency to be present while Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> briefed the Council on the latest developments in Saigon.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> explained that last night serious street fighting had broken out in the city of Saigon. A mortar shell had landed on the <pb xml:id="pg_308" n="308" facs="0338"/>Presidential Palace, the residence of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, at 1:15 p.m. After two further shells had landed in the Palace grounds, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had telephoned <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> and stated that he was ordering counterfire by the Vietnamese national forces. Eleven rounds of such counterfire had been counted by three o’clock in the afternoon. While there had since been rumors that a cease-fire had been arranged, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> doubted the validity of these reports, and said it seemed that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had ordered all-out action against the Binh Xuyen. In other words, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was proposing to force a showdown. It was not easy, continued Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>, to say which side had actually been responsible for precipitating last night’s events, but the real trouble had begun on April 26, when Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had ordered the removal of the Chief of Police of Saigon, who was a member of the Binh Xuyen gangster group.</p>
<p>In a showdown fight, continued Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>, and if the Vietnamese National Army remains loyal to the Prime Minister, there was little doubt that the Army could drive the Binh Xuyen forces out of Saigon. The difficulty was that such an attempt would almost certainly result in disturbances and civil war throughout South Vietnam. In addition, the street fighting might very well result in atrocities against French civilians living in Saigon. Finally, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has advised that he now intends to form a complete new Cabinet, and that he will announce its members tonight.</p>
<p>The President promptly inquired what <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> was likely to do in the face of the situation which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> had described. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> replied that he believed that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> would do nothing unless a threat should develop to foreigners resident in Saigon. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> then produced a map of the city of Saigon and adjacent areas, and rapidly described the chief features of the city and the deployment of the Binh Xuyen and the National Army forces.</p>
<p>The President then asked <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> whether the French were likely to interfere with American resupply of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s forces. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> thought that the French would not so interfere, and pointed out that the French have already offered an ammunition depot in Saigon to the Vietnamese forces.</p>
<p>At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> reminded the Council of the decision with respect to U.S. policy toward South Vietnam which the Council had made in January of this year. While he was doing so, the Executive Secretary handed out a draft record of action prepared in the Department of State, which State suggested should be adopted in lieu of the earlier Council action of January. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that the chief difference was that the earlier action had pinpointed Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> as the individual whose government the United States should support.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_309" n="309" facs="0339"/>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he would like to comment in general on the situation in which we found ourselves respecting South Vietnam. In his view, the present difficulties had two fundamental causes. First, the limitations of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> as the head of a government. While <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s good qualities were well known and need not be elaborated, it was a fact that he came from the northern part of the country and was not very trustful of other people, perhaps for good reason. Furthermore, he was not very good at delegating authority. Despite these shortcomings, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> might have proved adequate to the situation if it had not been for the second fundamental limitation—namely, the lack of solid support from the French. While the top leaders of the French Government, such as <persName corresp="#p_MFP1">Mendes-France</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName>, have gone along with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> reluctantly, French colonial officials on the scene in Vietnam have done their best to sabotage him. These two fundamental limitations in conjunction have brought about a situation that has finally induced <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> to conclude that we must now look for a replacement for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, we have been telling the French for a considerable period that we would be prepared to consider an alternative to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> if they could come up with one. They haven’t as yet done so. Moreover, the mechanics of effecting a change at this time would be very difficult. A change of Premier would necessarily involve recourse to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, and we have always felt that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s influence would be invariably exerted in favor of the Binh Xuyen, which supplies his ample funds. We haven’t therefore, been inclined to look with very much favor on a new South Vietnam government appointed by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. On the contrary, we have felt that it was really essential that a showdown occur between <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and the rebellious sects. Such a showdown both <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and the French have consistently tried to avoid.</p>
<p>Late yesterday afternoon, however, we in the State Department dispatched a complicated series of cables to Saigon outlining ways and means of replacing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and his government.<note n="4" xml:id="d148fn4"><ref target="#d140">Documents 140</ref>, <ref target="#d141">141</ref>, and <ref target="#d142">142</ref>.</note> However, in view of the developments and the outbreak of last night, we have instructed our people in Saigon to hold up action on our plan for replacing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. The developments of last night could either lead to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s utter overthrow or to his emergence from the disorder as a major hero. Accordingly, we are pausing to await the results before trying to settle on <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> or Defense Minister [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> as possible replacements. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> confessed that he was not much impressed with the Defense Minister. On the other hand, unless something occurs in the Saigon disorders out of which <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will emerge <pb xml:id="pg_310" n="310" facs="0340"/>as the hero, we will have to have a change. This is the view both of <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> has played an honest game with us in this whole affair.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> had actually threatened to take the matter in his own hands and establish a new government himself. Indeed, we are not absolutely sure that we can restrain him from so doing, since he so to speak represents the only existing source of legitimate governmental authority. Thus we find ourselves obliged to work with him and through him to some extent, until we are in a position to devise some alternative source of authority.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of his statement, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> to present his views. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> began by reminding the National Security Council of his earlier appearance before it prior to his departure for Saigon, and of the position he had taken at that time—namely, that there were five major factors on which the future of Free Vietnam would depend. He said that he would briefly run over these same five factors now.</p>
<list>
<item>(1) The possibility of an overt attack on Free Vietnam by the Vietminh. Of this <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> stated there was very little danger at the present time.</item>
<item>(2) The loyalty of the Vietnamese National Army to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> emphasized that to date the Vietnamese National Army had been loyal to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, but that loyalty would almost certainly not extend to supporting the Prime Minister in a civil war. The Army violently disliked the Binh Xuyen, but it also disliked the prospect of engaging in a civil war in South Vietnam which would also include the Hoa Hao and the Cao Dai sects, which were quite strong in the southern portions of Free Vietnam. The great danger of trying to drive the Binh Xuyen from their strongholds in Saigon, said <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName>, was precisely the danger that such an attempt would end in widespread civil war.</item>
<item>(3) The problem of the sects. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> pointed out that we have feared all along that efforts to cut down the size of the private armies of the sects and to dry up their financial resources would cause trouble. This was probably inevitable, whether <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> or anyone else made the effort. On the other hand, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> insisted that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s handling of the problem of the sects had been anything but astute.</item>
<item>(4) The attitude of the French. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> said that since this had been thoroughly covered by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, he would add no more except to point out that there could be no doubt of the loyal role played with him by <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName>.</item>
<item>(5) The personality of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. On this point <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> said that as early as the end of his first week in Saigon he had come to entertain very serious doubts as to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s ability to govern. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> betrayed no political knack whatsoever in his handling of men. His ineptitude in this respect was responsible for the series of resignations from his Cabinet. It was no mere matter of rats quitting a sinking <pb xml:id="pg_311" n="311" facs="0341"/>ship. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> felt that it was a particular misfortune to lose <persName>Minh</persName>, the young Secretary of Defense, and <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName>, the older Secretary of Foreign Affairs, whom <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> considered to be a man of very good judgment. If, said <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> makes good on his statement that he would name a new Cabinet, this Cabinet would almost certainly consist of unknown individuals who had no public standing.</item>
</list>
<p>All this induced <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> to conclude that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s number was up. Nor had he ever felt that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was the indispensable man. Accordingly, even without <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> the program adopted by the Council for South Vietnam could and should go forward without interruption, even though its estimated costs would be $40 million more this year than previously estimated. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> emphasized that he still felt that this U.S. policy and program was a gamble worth taking, although certainly a gamble. A long-term solution of the sect problem was vital to the success of the program. It was likewise vital to take control of the police away from the Binh Xuyen. Finally, it was essential to get genuine French support for the policy and program, no matter who was the Vietnamese Prime Minister.</p>
<p>The President commented that it was an absolute sine qua non of success that the Vietnamese National Army destroy the power of the Binh Xuyen. Otherwise any new government was bound to fail. To this <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> replied that the attempt to destroy the Binh Xuyen by military action would almost certainly produce civil war in Vietnam. The Binh Xuyen, if removed from Saigon, would take to the Maquis and raise hell for years to come. Accordingly, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> said he personally preferred a political solution. He had wished <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to form a genuine coalition government. He doubted very much whether <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could be prevailed upon to try it, but such a political solution seemed most likely to bring success.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> inquired how far the Communists were behind the disorders and outbreaks in Saigon. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> replied that there could be no doubt that they were stimulating and exploiting the disorders that existed.</p>
<p>At this point Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> read the proposed record of action. The President inquired if there were any objections. There being none, the President observed that the proposed action sounded all right to him, and that he could not see what else we could do at this time.</p>
<p>At the close of the discussion, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> commented that if it were any comfort to the Council, there was quite a good deal of evidence that the Vietminh were encountering considerable difficulty in their part of Vietnam.</p>

<p>1. You should carry out paragraph 7a of <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 3828 to Paris rptd Saigon 4756. Secretary saw French Ambassador late today, and talked to him along these lines:</p>
<p>Situation disturbing and disappointing in Vietnam. Some people have concluded it confirms estimate it is hopeless to try to build anything there. Considerable concern felt in all quarters in Washington <pb xml:id="pg_313" n="313" facs="0343"/>and we must re-examine our policies. Question of French support for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government important. Without criticizing French Government in any way, it is fact French interests and opinion in Saigon in particular have never supported and often opposed <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. Perhaps this could not be helped but French Government had undertaken last year understanding with us on wholehearted support for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government in effort to rally all anti-Communist forces to it. If nevertheless present state of affairs is result, we must recognize there are very serious obstacles to such support that will prevent any government in Vietnam from succeeding. We feel it is essential that we have some frank statement from French that they can whole-heartedly support another government without leading to similar results; or if their support cannot more adequately assure better results then we had better know it because it is going to be most difficult for US to continue support particularly in view of evident congressional opinion. French should realize it would probably be difficult get support from Congress for any change in Saigon in any case.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> expressed his opinion that no government in Vietnam has any hope unless French Government and <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> give unequivocal evidence of full support. Secretary pointed out incongruity of situation where chief of government is prevented from taking measures against rebels in control of police. Every time he has tried to he is pushed back while the Binh Xuyen is not. Both Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> emphasized that, unless <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> takes adequate measures to remove the police control from the Binh Xuyen and ensures the integration of the sects, then every government in Vietnam will suffer same fate as <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>
<p>Secretary said <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> was returning Friday morning<note n="4" xml:id="d149fn4">April 29.</note> to Saigon and would be in touch with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> immediately. Secretary also emphasized that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> should not crystallize any action until <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> have been able to review the situation together. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> scheduled arrive Saigon Monday May 2d.</p>
<p>2. In elaborating on the above paragraph and <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> you may give the following points orally to French authorities but not in writing:</p>
<list>
<item>“The present crisis has forced the US to review its basic policy toward Viet-Nam.</item>
<item>“In our judgment, even with the full support of the US, no government in Viet-Nam will succeed unless it enjoys—
<list>
<item>1. Nationalist Vietnamese support;</item>
<item>2. Unambiguous French support; and</item>
<item>3. Full support by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>.</item>
</list></item>
<item>“For over six months the US has loyally and vigorously supported the present government under <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. We are fully aware of his <pb xml:id="pg_314" n="314" facs="0344"/>administrative and personal weaknesses which have contributed to the present crisis. We firmly believe, however, that no government could have avoided the present crisis with only the partial support of the French government and <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>.</item>
<item>“We have no intention of trying to head off the proposed action by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> or otherwise intervene in the present situation, but we want the French and <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> to have no doubt as to our attitude.</item>
<item>“The US is not interested in continuing to seek to give support to Viet-Nam under the present ambiguous conditions. We will not continue to engage our prestige and furnish our resources for a project which is certain to fail.</item>
<item>“To obtain US support, therefore, any future government in Viet-Nam, whether or not it includes <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, must be clearly assured of the following:
<list>
<item>1. The full and unqualified support of France, thereby dispelling any ambiguity with respect to North Viet-Nam.</item>
<item>2. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> must ensure that the legal government has full authority, including control of the police and the military forces of Viet-Nam.</item>
<item>3. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and the French must wholeheartedly assist by every means available to them in integrating the sects into the normal life of Viet-Nam, in relieving them of their feudal power, and territorial control, and integrating their private armies into the national army.”</item>

At <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s request, I went to see him late evening April 28 “to review events of the day.” I feel certain <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s request was based on conversation he had had earlier in evening with British Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SSHS1">Stephenson</persName>, in which <persName corresp="#p_SSHS1">Stephenson</persName> urged <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> to do everything possible avoid recurrence of situation following events night March 29 when US and France found themselves taking firm opposing views as to responsibility origin of incident.</p>
<p>2. When I arrived at <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s residence accompanied by Embassy officer, I found <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> surrounded by <persName corresp="#p_GGLCF1">Gambiez</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_VLG1">Van Laethem</persName>,<note n="2" xml:id="d151fn2"><persName corresp="#p_VLG1">Gabriel Van Laethem</persName>, Counselor in the Cabinet of <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName>.</note> De Rougement and another staff officer. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_GGLCF1">Gambiez</persName> to give us full account available information as to origins of day’s conflict which was still going on as we sat there. <persName corresp="#p_GGLCF1">Gambiez</persName>’ account was substantially similar to that reported (<gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 4881 rptd Paris 1261.<note n="3" xml:id="d151fn3">See <ref target="#d143">Document 143</ref>.</note>) Emphasis was placed on fact mortar shells had landed “Y” Bridge area from unknown point of origin at approximately 12:15 and that shelling of Palace did not occur until one hour later. French briefing (SPD) morning April 29, however, made no mention 12:15 mortar shelling but stated mortar exchange began 13:15 at time attack on Palace.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_316" n="316" facs="0346"/>
<p>3. French emphasized they had been scrupulously careful not attempt block actions National Army but had repeatedly urged cessation of hostilities.</p>
<p>4. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> appeared deeply agitated over apparent continued determination <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> press conflict. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> insisted <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had violated truce by bringing reinforcements to Saigon, by removing Binh Xuyen Police Chief <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Lai Van Sang</persName>, and inferentially by responsibility for 12:15 mortar fire.</p>
<p>5. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> inquired if I would be willing see <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and urge him cease hostilities. I replied that I had personally witnessed from Embassy roof earlier in evening heavy exchanges of fire between Binh Xuyen and National Army, and that shells had been clearly visible flying in both directions. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> seemed slightly surprised that Binh Xuyen were returning National Army fire. I pointed out we do not see matter in sharp black and white tones as French appear to do. I would see <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> April 29 in order learn further details his side of story but could give no commitment I would urge him cease fire.</p>

<p>4926. Part I.</p>
<p>1. I called on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> noon April 29, arriving immediately after Cabinet meeting. While waiting for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> I had conversation with [name and title deleted].</p>
<p>2. [Name deleted] informed me that at Cabinet meeting, Cabinet unanimously counseled <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> not transfer high military command to <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Vy</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d152fn2"><p>As reported in telegram 4917 from Saigon, April 29, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> issued a decree on April 28 naming General <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Nguyen Van Vy</persName> as Supreme Commander of the Vietnamese National Armed Forces and empowering him to take all necessary measures to avoid armed conflict between the national army, the police forces, and the sects. (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.)</p>
<p>Prior to receipt of this telegram in Washington, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> learned of this move on the news ticker and immediately telephoned the French Ambassador in Washington, <persName corresp="#p_CMMJ1">Couve de Murville</persName>. The conversation, as transcribed in <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’s office, was as follows:</p>
<p>“The Sec. said there is a ticker report that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> has recognized <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Vy</persName> as Commander-in-Chief of the Army. The Amb. said he has not heard anything about it. The Sec. said he hopes it is not true as if, in the middle of this battle when it looks as if the forces of law and order are gaining the ascendancy, the army is taken away from the head of government, it will look as though <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and the French are really supporting Binh Xuyen, and not the legal government. If that impression got around, the Sec. would think it was hopeless to expect further backing from the US. The Sec. asked him to find out if it is true, and the Amb. said he would right away.” (<persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Library, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> Papers, General Telephone Conversations)</p>
</note> [Name deleted] most contemptuous regarding General <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Vy</persName>, who <pb xml:id="pg_317" n="317" facs="0347"/>he states sent special message <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> via Imperial Cabinet approximately week ago protesting his desire for peace when [name deleted] had previously forbidden him to send any such message. After [name deleted] tried to get explanation from <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Vy</persName> regarding “numerous army officers” associating themselves with <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Vy</persName> in his message, <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Vy</persName> fled to Dalat where he has remained until this morning. With regard <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s instructions <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> come to Paris, [name deleted] said no one willing accept responsibilities of interim government during <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s absence and Cabinet had therefore counseled <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> remain. He stated that if <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> wished make change he should have made clean break and named somebody else. In reply my question, however, [name deleted] said he did not believe it would be in “national interest” for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to go even under such circumstances and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would probably resist.</p>
<p>3. [Name deleted] expressed violently anti-French sentiments accusing French colonialists of being responsible for present imbroglio.</p>
<p>Part II.</p>
<p>1. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in obviously troubled yet calm mood confirmed what [name deleted] had said regarding <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Vy</persName> and Cabinet advice. He added situation would become hopelessly out of hand if he, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, left country. He put particular emphasis on support renewed to him this morning by <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> Generals <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Trinh Minh The</persName> and Hoa Hao General Nguyen Giac Ngo (<gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 4895 Paris 1263<note n="3" xml:id="d152fn3">Dated April 29, not printed. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/4–2955)</note>), stating they in highly excitable mood and they would resort to armed action should <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Vy</persName> be named Commander in Chief or should <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> be replaced. He stated that to remove <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName> at this time would be regarded by Vietnamese soldiers as insult and installation of <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Vy</persName> would most certainly mean civil war. Asked regarding <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName>’s views, he said <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName> would stay as long as <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> refrained from officially passing military powers to <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Vy</persName> ([name deleted] had not been so sure of this as <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> professed to be).</p>
<p>2. While not as bitterly anti-French as [name deleted], <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> stated his firm conviction French are supporting Binh Xuyen, both morally and with munitions. He states French provided six helicopters for evacuation Binh Xuyen wounded and that <gloss target="#t_FAVN1">FAVN</gloss> troops night April 28 captured two armed French soldiers in Binh Xuyen post. He states French-inspired truce has given Binh Xuyen chance to <pb xml:id="pg_318" n="318" facs="0348"/>reinforce their positions. (In this regard <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> morning April 29 took attitude <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> acting illegally because he had broken truce. When I asked <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> whether Binh Xuyen had not been breaking truce through introduction additional troops and armaments he made no reply.)</p>
<p>3. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> states he intends send message <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> pointing out removal <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName> in favor <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Vy</persName> at this time would create impossible situation within army and that no one is willing take over Prime Ministership should <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> leave country. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will say, he says, that at present crucial juncture it is absolutely essential for nation that he remain in Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> adds that should <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> nevertheless insist, it might well mean end of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, although <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> says he thinks “he might perhaps stop any revolt against His Majesty.” While dictating this telegram I have been informed <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has issued public statement saying he will decline transfer military authority to General <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Vy</persName> and will not comply <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s instructions proceed to France.</p>
<p>4. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, referring to transfer of police powers, pointed out he had been asked time and again to wait while political solution found. No solution was upcoming and in order retain his authority as Prime Minister it was essential he act. He said he had told <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> he had no choice but to change Chief of Police and <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> had not replied until after action was taken (we are not unaware that this if factual might have been deliberate timing on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s part).</p>
<p>Part III.</p>
<p>1. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> states Binh Xuyen are organ of French colonialism. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>, on other hand, states <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is “irresponsible madman” and merely chief of band. There is total lack of common ground between two points of view. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> indicates he will resist <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s instructions. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> states that if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> remains he, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>, will wash his hands of responsibility.</p>
<p>2. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, in our conversation, asked me nothing regarding US policy and I limited my comments to pointing out that in not obeying <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s order he would be undertaking an extremely grave responsibility and that it was certain French would lay blame on him, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, for what might follow.</p>
<p>3. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> asked me call this morning and I found British Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SSHS1">Stephenson</persName> with him. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> apparently extremely anxious to get my support in counseling <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to negotiate cease fire and my agreement to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s version of sequence military events precipitating developments of April 28 (<gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 4882, Paris 1262<note n="4" xml:id="d152fn4"><ref target="#d146">Document 146</ref>.</note>).</p>
<p>Part IV.</p>
<p>1. French info service officer, briefing press this morning, stated I had met this morning with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and that we had made joint US-French attempt obtain cease fire which had failed. French official on <pb xml:id="pg_319" n="319" facs="0349"/>being asked about French policy stated that it is to get cease fire and that it has US support. These allegations are without foundation and I have so informed <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> representative who queried me.</p>

<p>4929. 1. At 1530 April 29, British Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SSHS1">Stephenson</persName> and I met with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> at his request. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> asked about my conversation during morning with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> (<gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 4926, Paris 1270<note n="2" xml:id="d153fn2"><hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note>). I outlined high points which <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> subsequently included in press release (<gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 4916, Paris 1268<note n="3" xml:id="d153fn3">Dated April 29, not printed. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/4–2955)</note>). He asked me what line I had taken with President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and I informed him that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had not asked my advice and I had not proferred it, but had restricted myself to commenting that if he should not obey <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s instructions, he would be taking on his shoulders a very grave responsibility indeed. I added that I had informed <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> also that I hoped everything would be done to avoid needless bloodshed. In reply to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s query I said that I had not advised <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to seek cease-fire, nor had I made any mention of possible illegality as result <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> not complying <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s instructions.</p>
<p>2. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> then reiterated that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s refusal obey <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> put him in illegal position. I commented that I had not seen actual text <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s instructions; that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> had not removed <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> as <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>, and that I thought it could be fairly argued that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> as <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> had right at least to reply to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> giving his estimate of situation and reasons which influenced <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> not respond immediately to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s bidding. I said that when it came to question of illegality, it seemed to me that it had been <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Lai Van Sang</persName> who had been acting illegally. (<persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> then gave me text <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> message to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 4928 rptd Paris 1271.<note n="4" xml:id="d153fn4">See <ref target="#d150fn2">footnote 2, Document 150</ref>.</note>)</p>
<p>3. <persName corresp="#p_SSHS1">Stephenson</persName> said that if <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and I agreed he would be willing see <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, but that he would be able go no further than I had gone. <persName corresp="#p_SSHS1">Stephenson</persName> has always taken viewpoint that he would see <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> only <pb xml:id="pg_320" n="320" facs="0350"/>when it would be of help to French and Americans in their cooperation in support of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and I agreed that it might be helpful if he saw <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. (On leaving <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SSHS1">Stephenson</persName> commented that he thought I had taken only possible line of action vis-à-vis <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.)</p>
<p>4. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>, I believe, had hoped he could get American and British support in a démarche to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> for cease-fire. He stated he would have to act unilaterally and would probably do so afternoon April 29. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Unevaluated eyewitness report indicates French North African troops active in area central market and observed moving toward Boulevard Gallieni, for what purpose we do not know.</p>

</list>
<p>The Ambassador opened the meeting by outlining in detail those points on which the United States Government would like clarification from the French Government prior to proceeding with the consideration of questions of procedure and personalities posed in the French Aide-Mémoire of April 17, as well as those assurances of wholehearted support for the future Vietnamese Government which the United States Government feels must be received from the French Government and <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> in order to justify the continued support of the United States Government in South Vietnam. A detailed account of the Ambassador’s exposition, which was read and approved by the French, was contained in the reference telegram as <pb xml:id="pg_321" n="321" facs="0351"/>well as the Ambassador’s comments to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Edgar Faure</persName> regarding United States concern over the continuation of <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Jean Sainteny</persName> in the role of French Delegate General to North Vietnam. The following summary of the French reaction was read and approved by the French and is set forth here since it is in greater detail than the account given in the reference telegram.</p>
<p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Edgar Faure</persName> began by saying that he must tell us in all seriousness that the French Government felt constrained to review its policy vis-à-vis Vietnam in the light of recent developments, and to confirm that the French Government had no intention of intervening unilaterally with <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> at this juncture.</p>
<p>He reminded us that for the past six months the French Government had made clear its conviction to the United States Government that the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government did not possess the capability of effecting a stabilization of the political situation in South Vietnam, and that for the past month the French Government had endeavored to persuade the United States Government to enter into a joint review of the political situation at Saigon and to reach mutual agreement on a course of action to follow that might avert the outbreak of civil war. He added the personal comment that while holding the posts successively of Minister of Finance, Foreign Affairs, and now Prime Minister, he had not met a single person who believed that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could succeed in stabilizing the situation at Saigon.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister emphasized, however, that while neither he nor anyone in the French Government shared the American point of view as regards <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, he wished to make clear that neither he nor the French Government had any intention or desire to enter into conflict with the United States on this score. The fact that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is anti-French, he said, is and has always been a secondary consideration as far as the French were concerned. The Prime Minister reiterated once again that the French Government is not wedded to any particular formula for the solution of the crisis at Saigon and that it continued to hold the hope that it might be possible to reach, in consultation with us, a mutually satisfactory position.</p>
<p>In referring to the steps taken by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> yesterday to convoke <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> as well as certain Vietnamese personalities to Cannes, the Prime Minister expressed his very real fear that these steps had perhaps been taken too late to save South Vietnam from full-scale civil war. If <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s action had been taken several weeks ago, he said, the chances of success would have been infinitely greater than those presented to us today. Although it may be too late to prevent the occurrence of full-scale civil war in South Vietnam, the Prime Minister said that France remains ready to do its utmost in conjunction with the United States to retrieve the situation. In this connection, the Prime Minister expressed the view that with the sole exception <pb xml:id="pg_322" n="322" facs="0352"/>of the problem posed by our feeling that <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">M. Sainteny</persName> not return to Hanoi, he foresaw no difficulty in the French Government’s accepting the views of the United States Government as outlined by the Ambassador. He said, however, that he would like Minister Laforest and other officials concerned to go over the points as outlined by the Ambassador and that he would confirm the French position shortly.</p>
<p>As regards United States concern over French policy towards North Vietnam, the Prime Minister said that he wished to underline in strongest terms that the French Government was not following an equivocal policy or playing “a double game” in Vietnam and that it had no intention of “playing the Vietminh card” to the detriment of the legally constituted Government of South Vietnam. He emphasized that the French Government had no illusions regarding <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName>. However, he said, France needed a representative at Hanoi not with a view to cooperating with the Vietminh but solely for the purpose of protecting such French interests and influence as remain and to keep abreast of developments in that region. The Prime Minister made abundantly clear that for domestic political considerations it was out of the question for him to relieve <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> of his functions. However, he wished to assure the United States Government that the French Government had, as in the past, every intention of taking fully into account United States views in this regard. Minister Laforest at this juncture stated that the failure of the French Government to conclude the mixed company agreement with the Vietminh could be attributed in large measure to the unfavorable attitude taken by the United States Government toward the conclusion of such an agreement. The sale of the Charbonnages du Tonkin constituted, he said, a clear-cut illustration of the intention of the French Government to give maximum consideration to United States views. The person of <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName>, however, Minister Laforest reiterated, posed a domestic political problem. The latter’s role, he said, was limited to that of an observer, and <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> had been selected for this post solely because he was considered to be the best qualified man for the job. The <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> mission as constituted today, the Prime Minister emphasized, represented a far more preferable approach than that of being placed in the position of having to accredit a consul to the Vietminh Government, a situation which the French Government has tried to avoid from the beginning. In conclusion, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> stressed that with the sole exception of the recall of <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName>, he could foresee no impediment to French acceptance of the points as outlined by the Ambassador pursuant to the Department’s instructions.</p>
<p>In response to the Ambassador’s inquiry concerning <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s delegation of full military power to General <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Vy</persName>, Minister Laforest stated that <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Vy</persName> was the oldest Vietnamese General, that he was generally respected, and stressed the importance of the fact that General <pb xml:id="pg_323" n="323" facs="0353"/> <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Vy</persName> had made clear that he did not wish to participate in a fratricidal civil war. He noted that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> presently has perhaps approximately 10 battalions of Tonkinese troops, including elite parachute elements, presently engaged in supporting him in the present conflict at Saigon. Minister Laforest likened the situation to the Swiss support of <persName corresp="#p_GGLCF1">Louis</persName> XVI. However, he said, while <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> might succeed in gaining control of the situation in Saigon–Cholon, unquestionably civil war would flare up and continue indecisively in the provinces. Many terrible things could occur in the next several weeks, he added, and irremediable damage inflicted. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> intervened to point out that the Vietminh are deliberately keeping clear of the present conflict, “rubbing their hands in delight”, with full knowledge that civil war will ultimately deliver South Vietnam into their hands.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister at this juncture referred to his statement at his morning press conference to the effect that France would keep its engagements under the Geneva Accords as regards elections, and he expressed the fear that the scheduled elections had been passed over (depasse) by events which very likely would deliver South Vietnam in fact into the hands of the Vietminh before July 1956.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister stressed, however, that it was perhaps not impossible to retrieve the situation and ultimately succeed in the test with the Vietminh if joint Franco-American action taken quickly. He underlined that the basic objective of France and the United States was the same, namely to maintain and safeguard a non-Communist Vietnam within the free world orbit. <persName corresp="#p_FE1">M. Faure</persName> made clear, however, that the next move was primarily up to the United States and, specifically, he expressed the hope that the United States would exert its influence on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to see that he returned to Cannes in accordance with <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s request in an effort to salvage the situation and find a salutary solution.</p>

<p>On April 29 the United States and France signed an agreement providing for a United States grant of $100 million in assistance to the French Expeditionary Corps (<gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>) in Indochina. The $100 million figure represented a little less than 25 percent of the estimated cost of the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> for 1955. Immediately prior to the signing, the French were informed orally that the United States would feel obliged to reexamine its program of financial support if serious policy differences regarding Vietnam continued between Paris and <pb xml:id="pg_324" n="324" facs="0354"/>Washington. French Finance Minister Pflimlin, speaking for his government, stated he fully understood and appreciated the United States position. It was agreed with the French that no press statements or publicity should be given to the signing of this agreement.

<p>MG 376–P, <gloss target="#t_DTG1">DTG</gloss> 291140Z (Army message). Following is a résumé of Saigon–Cholon conflict between <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> and Binh Xuyen forces which began 1315 hours local 29 [<hi rend="italic">28</hi>] April with mortar shelling of Palace following numerous small fire fights of recent days.</p>
<p>Prior 1400 hours, <persName corresp="#p_GGLCF1">General Gambiez</persName> called <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> Headquarters on Rue Gallieni and inspected mortars. Mortars had not been fired but shortly after <persName corresp="#p_GGLCF1">Gambiez</persName> departed Binh Xuyen mortar fire received in Headquarters area which then returned by <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> and concentrated battle began along Rue Gallieni. Binh Xuyen reportedly set fire huts around motor pool at <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> Headquarters but <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> succeeded in getting out all but two vehicles. Extensive area between Rue Gallieni and Chinois Arroyo burned out during afternoon. At 1700 hours, President ordered <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> to clean out Binh Xuyen and <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> went on offensive with four parachute battalions. <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> succeeded in gaining objective of banks of Chinois Arroyo by 1300 hours, 29 April, having overcome Binh Xuyen Headquarters on Rue Gallieni and most other Binh Xuyen strong points in city. In separate action <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> captured Binh Xuyen post at Lycee Petrus Ky. Grande Monde, a Binh Xuyen stronghold, burned out. Timber span of Y bridge leading to Binh Xuyen posts south of Chinois Arroyo blown by Binh Xuyen, temporarily out of use. Fires along Rue Gallieni had burned out by morning <pb xml:id="pg_325" n="325" facs="0355"/>April 29. Fighting died down about 1200 hours local April 29, resumed 1700 hours. <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> expects mop up areas already engaged afternoon April 29. <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> estimates their casualties 20–30 killed, 150 hospitalized, Binh Xuyen casualties 100 killed, 400 wounded. Heavy civilian casualties.</p>
<p>At 1430 hours 29 April, French started deploying heavily armed soldiers along principal boundaries of European Sector in Saigon, possibly concerned about flanking movements or to prevent spreading fight to European Zone. <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> reports Binh Xuyen posts in Saigon area controlled by French contain three companies of Binh Xuyen. This provides tense situation.</p>
<p><gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> appears have capability, morale and desire to finish Binh Xuyen now. Having taken many casualties during past month adds to <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> incentives, however, recent orders from <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> concerning consultations in France have apparently produced some dismay and indecision which could be dispelled by strong US stand in support of government. Any change in leadership or command at this time could result in chaos.</p>

<p>4952. 1. I saw <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> at 1730 on April 30 to review current situation.<note n="2" xml:id="d157fn2">In an unpublished article <persName corresp="#p_KRA1">Kidder</persName> states that he saw <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> three times on April 30 and that before the first of these conversations he received telegram 3837 to Paris, April 27, repeated to Saigon (<ref target="#d144">Document 144</ref>). “So, when <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> asked me whether the U.S. would support the French in removing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> all that I knew for certain was that further instructions from Washington would be following. Obviously they were having second thoughts there but what these were I had no idea. I was left no choice but to make up my own mind what our policy was as I would be damned if I was going to say I didn’t know. . . . I told <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> ‘No’. He was flabbergasted, being fully aware of <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ decision to urge Washington to drop <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and believed that was to be our course of action. ‘How do you know that?’ he asked me. My reply, ‘General I know American foreign policy’.” (<persName corresp="#p_KRA1">Randolph A. Kidder</persName>, unpublished manuscript in possession of the author).</note></p>
<p>2. Commenting on relative calm during last 24 hours <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he had made démarche to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> through <persName corresp="#p_WM1">Wintrebert</persName> afternoon April 29 and had put French guards on 2 bridges over Arroyo Chinois at point where it enters Saigon River. He said he had copy Vietnamese plans <pb xml:id="pg_326" n="326" facs="0356"/>and wished prevent fighting from spreading to dock area along river south of Arroyo. He also believes arrival General <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Vy</persName> may have some pacifying influence. He states <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Vy</persName> is meeting this evening with General <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName> and Colonels [garble] and <persName corresp="#p_TVD2">Don</persName> in attempt work out relative positions. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> does not know whether <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName> will go along with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> or not.</p>
<p>3. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> emphasized his firm belief that sole responsibility for recent trouble lies on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s shoulders. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has insulted him numerous times and indulges in constant lying against French. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> will not stay if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> remains. He reiterated <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> no longer head of a government but is illegal and has no Cabinet left. He alleged only 3 Ministers remained to support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s reply to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> instructions to come to Paris. He seemed surprised when I told him that I myself had seen at least 10 Ministers coming out of April 29 Cabinet meeting. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> states that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should have resigned if he couldn’t control situation but had no comment when I pointed out that such action would have constituted clear-cut Binh Xuyen victory. In any case, he said, Binh Xuyen had no reason whatsoever start trouble, as it was in their interest await <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> action. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> or his friends only ones who had interest in instigating incident. In brief, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> is personally and emotionally involved and can see only one side of picture.</p>
<p>4. Re <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> sending General <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName> to Saigon, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> believes it stupid mistake and has so cabled Paris, hoping <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName> can be stopped en route.</p>
<p>5. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> says he has proof Viet Minh are profiting from trouble and are infiltrating and using Binh Xuyen and Hoa Hao and attempting prevent settlement of fighting.</p>
<p>6. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> mentioned Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>’s talk with <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> (Paris telegram 4740 repeated Saigon 689<note n="3" xml:id="d157fn3">See <ref target="#d154fn2">footnote 2, Document 154</ref>.</note>).

<p>4953. 1. As reported part III (1) <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 4926 rptd Paris 1270<note n="2" xml:id="d158fn2"><ref target="#d152">Document 152</ref>.</note> there is no longer any common ground on understanding between <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> has not seen <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> or any of his Ministers since April 15, having used <persName corresp="#p_WM1">Wintrebert</persName> as go-between. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> states one reason for this is that his presence is like red flag to bull with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>
<p>2. French, in their anxiety avoid bloodshed in Saigon–Cholon and protect French lives and property, have understandably used all influence restrain <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> from taking any action wich would lead to violence on part of Binh Xuyen and sect front. This fact, plus decision withdraw support from <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, has brought them to position where their neutrality can be fairly described as being favorable to Binh Xuyen whom we regard as rebels against legitimate government. They hindered National Army reaction to Binh Xuyen attack on March 29, and while they have not taken comparable action in present episode, they have tended lay major, if not full, blame on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, continuing to regard struggle as one between equals.</p>
<p>3. This represents fundamental difference of opinion between <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and myself.</p>
<p>4. We here have consistently supported and followed policy of close collaboration with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> in support of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government, believing it necessary if Free Vietnam to be saved. Carrying out that policy in present circumstances where there is fundamental difference of opinion, combined with necessity of preserving best possible relations with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> pending <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ return, has dictated my actions during last few days. I have not failed make clear to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> that I disagree with him, but I have felt it wise to avoid extended discussion of issues. Based on my own conviction, I have emphasized to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> the serious nature of the actions which he has proposed take in defying <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, and fact that full responsibility will be placed on his shoulders. I have not been willing, nor has British Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SSHS1">Stephenson</persName>, join with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> in joint approach to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> seeking cease-fire. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>, April 29, proposed to <persName corresp="#p_SSHS1">Stephenson</persName> and me following press release: “At end of morning and beginning of afternoon, Chargé d’Affaires of US, Ambassador of Great Britain, and finally representative <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> visited President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> to inform him of common desire of 3 govts that end be made to bloodshed, conforming to instructions of Chief of State. They informed President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, <pb xml:id="pg_328" n="328" facs="0358"/>in course of same démarche, they hoped mission confided to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> by His Majesty <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> would permit prompt re-establishment of order.”</p>
<p>5. <persName corresp="#p_SSHS1">Stephenson</persName> and I stated that we could not agree to release of any such statement. I pointed out it was not factual as regards actions that I had taken or expected to take.</p>
<p>6. While fully appreciating <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s loyal cooperation in past, and continuing necessity of close US-French collaboration, I believe we must review our position with regard to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> himself in light recent developments. I do not think I exaggerate when I say that if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should be retained as <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s usefulness to France in Vietnam and indirectly to ourselves will have been seriously compromised, if not finished, by his profound reaction against <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. Rightly or wrongly <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and many other Vietnamese consider French flag is nailed to Binh Xuyen masthead. This factor can dangerously jeopardize French influence and position in Free Vietnam in future.</p>

<p>A. Composition proposed new Cabinet.</p>
<p>1. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> informed Chargé afternoon April 30 that political events of previous day had changed <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s plans concerning announcement new Cabinet (<gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 4951<note n="3" xml:id="d159fn3">Dated April 30, not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid,</hi> 751G.00/4–3O55)</note>). These events were decision of <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> Generals Phoung and <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Trinh Minh The</persName>, Hoa Hao General Nguyen Giac Ngo and leaders various political groups to:</p>
<list>
<item>A. Constitute themselves into new political front;</item>
<item>B. Denounce and repudiate <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> as Chief of State;</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_329" n="329" facs="0359"/>
<item>C. Call for dissolution <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> govt on grounds it had been appointed by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>; and</item>
<item>D. Call on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> constitute provisional govt leading to general elections and National Assembly which would set up new govt. We had earlier understood <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> intended announced new Cabinet April 30. He now feels list is not sufficiently representative and says he will revise it.</item>
</list>
<p>2. Previous tentative Cabinet list (<gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 4955<note n="4" xml:id="d159fn4">Dated April 30, not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.)</note>) gives us helpful indication, however, lines of thinking being followed by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, and we can comment tentatively and in general terms on that.</p>
<p>3. Proposed Cabinet list, now presumably discarded, indicated <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s appreciation of necessity balance his own apparent desire create technician Cabinet whose members would be non-political and in harmony with his own views, with political requirement he give recognition in form of Cabinet posts to representatives groups supporting him. Posts of Information, Labor, Agriculture and Veterans Affairs among those reserved for Cao Dai, Hoa Hao and National Resistance Front. Technicians, many of whom are known to us, were in general technically competent and devoted nationalists. Fact that these men would accept posts in <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> govt at this time instead of seeking or retaining secure and renumerative positions speaks well for them as being devoted to their country. They are generally men of worth and not opportunists.</p>
<p>4. Specific comment on new Cabinet will have to await availability revised list.</p>
<p>B. Loyalty army to government and effect of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s naming <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Vy</persName>.</p>
<p>1. General Staff and senior Vietnamese Army commanders currently confused over legalities of situation. However, army is and will remain loyal to legal government unless forced to make political choices. If <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> appointment of <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Vy</persName> becomes effective, even with <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName> as Chief of Staff, army will be dragged into political arena. Army solidarity depends on retention of status quo or quiet <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> acceptance of dismissal should that eventuate. Worst possible development would be return May 2 of General <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName> as planned by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>.</p>
<p>2. There is reluctance certain high officers and various sections National Army continue hostilities. Of principal officers in Army at present time we know General <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Vy</persName> is opposed to continuing use of force. We believe <persName corresp="#p_DVMC1">Col. Minh</persName>, Commander First Military Region, holds same view. Gen. <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName>, Chief of Staff, is currently carrying out orders of government and presumably will continue do so as long as question of legal authority is not raised. Col. <persName corresp="#p_TVD2">Don</persName> of General Staff <pb xml:id="pg_330" n="330" facs="0360"/>represents majority thinking in army which believes job must be finished.</p>
<p>C. Military situation Saigon–Cholon and countryside.</p>
<p>Vietnamese Army in control Saigon–Cholon and remainder of country generally except for sect areas and localities to which national government authority does not extend. No indication any popular support for Binh Xuyen. Army as four battalions resting from recent fighting and six additional battalions guarding installations in Cholon. Only important Binh Xuyen elements in Saigon remain in French security area. French have reinforced military units and posted numerous armed guards at all critical points around area.</p>
<p>D. Binh Xuyen forces whereabouts, strength and supplies.</p>
<p>1. Binh Xuyen are still disposed immediately south of Arroyo Chinois. Currently low on ammunition and down to strength of approximately 2,000. Binh Xuyen are believed tired and nearly ready to quit. Some evidence exists of serious dissension within Binh Xuyen ranks. Binh Xuyen may find means to improve supply situation.</p>
<p>E. Government political position.</p>
<p>1. Political position <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> govt had been deteriorating steadily dining past weeks. In addition disillusionment many members <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s Cabinet as to his working methods, deterioration also due largely to apparent inability or unwillingness govt take firm action against defiance its authority by Binh Xuyen and Hoa Hao. Had <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, however, precipitated violence by initiating use of force against Binh Xuyen, we believe there would have been popular reaction against govt by peace-hungry population.</p>
<p>2. Fact that Binh Xuyen transformed local incident April 28 into major challenge authority of govt by heavily shelling Presidential Palace, however, has given new aspect to situation. As far as we are able to judge, Saigon–Cholon population in general, although lacking enthusiasm either for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> or for Binh Xuyen, is aware govt must strike back and crush rebels. There seems to be wide-spread hope issue will be settled once and for all.</p>
<p>3. By reacting with force, we believe govt has chosen only feasible course open to it. Wide-spread property destruction and loss of life may eventually cause grievances against govt, but for the moment prestige of govt has taken upturn which will be maintained only if govt presses issue to successful conclusion.</p>
<p>4. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s efforts take over police force by transferring Municipal Police to control Prefect Saigon–Cholon March 26, and his subsequent dismissal Binh Xuyen Director General National Police and appointment Colonel Le to that post, were generally regarded as paper efforts, and popular reaction was one of cynical “wait and see”. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s April 23 appeal met energetic response. By refraining from initiating use of force, however, but by responding vigorously when <pb xml:id="pg_331" n="331" facs="0361"/>attacked. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has, by force of circumstance, improved his political position, at least for time being. He presently benefits from fact he is attacking unpopular Binh Xuyen and opinion is wide-spread that in so doing he is defying “colonialist” French. This is giving him at least a temporary strength.</p>
<p>5. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s instructions April 28 for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to come to Paris with General <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName> and to leave General <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Vy</persName> with full military powers, have introduced completely new element in picture. At present moment. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is still real head of legal govt of Free Vietnam. As such his action against Binh Xuyen rebels is increasing prestige and strength his govt despite, and perhaps in part because of, French opposition. Should he be dismissed by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, however, and choose to refuse dismissal, we believe picture would be completely changed. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s new appointee would then be legal head of legal govt of Free Vietnam, and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, should he resist, would clearly be in rebellion. We believe he could not count on support more than part of army and population, and there would undoubtedly ensue a civil conflict which would imperil remaining hope saving Free Vietnam.</p>
<p>6. Two further factors which we believe important in current swiftly changing picture are rapidly mounting anti-French feeling on part Vietnamese population on one hand and determined and unreasoning emotional opposition of French to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> on the other. These factors, considered in connection with appearance in streets within last 24 hours of increasing numbers of French troops in close proximity Vietnamese forces, create dangerous and explosive situation which could easily be exploited by Viet Minh agents.</p>
<p>F. Supply position National Army.</p>
<p>Vietnamese Army reports supply situation satisfactory.</p>
<p>G. Any rallying or defections either side.</p>
<p>Vietnamese Army morale is up as result successful operations. Binh Xuyen reported to have suffered several hundred desertions plus 400 defectors who rallied to govt. Except for 200 “captives” and “sick” remaining 500 of National Police reported to have rallied to newly appointed chief, Colonel Le.<note n="5" xml:id="d159fn5">Telegram 4832 to Saigon, May 1, reads in part: “Department much appreciates useful timely country team analysis.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.)</note></p>

<p>4746. For <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> from Gibson. Following is second message drafted in Nice April 29 after second interview with Nguyen De and <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>,<note n="2" xml:id="d160fn2">In the first message, telegram 4743 from Paris, April 30, Gibson reported on his first interview with <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> on April 28 in which he had failed to persuade the Vietnamese monarch not to take action against <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> until the Department finished its deliberations on Vietnam and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> returned to Saigon. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> was adamant that he must remove from <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> emergency powers making him commander in chief of the army. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/4–3055)</note> résumé of which telephoned to <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> evening April 29.</p>
<p>1. After receipt <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 27 to Nice<note n="3" xml:id="d160fn3">In this telegram to the American Consulate at Nice, April 28, the Department instructed Gibson to emphasize to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> that the United States desired that he take no action against <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> until <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> returned to Saigon to review the situation with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/4–2855)</note> and word received by telephone from Paris that Amb <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> had called on <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> pursuant to <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 3849<note n="4" xml:id="d160fn4"><ref target="#d149">Document 149</ref>.</note> (results reported <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 4740, Saigon 687<note n="5" xml:id="d160fn5">See <ref target="#d154fn2">footnote 2, Document 154</ref>.</note>), Gibson called on first Nguyen De and then immediately following on <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>.</p>
<p>2. We informed De that Ambassador had seen <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> and reviewed with him important aspects France–U.S. policy Vietnam. We referred to necessity that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, as well as French, give full support to legally constituted Govt. Vietnam.</p>
<p>3. We then had general review with De in course of which we made point to him given to us over telephone from Washington. We emphasized that any further steps toward solution Vietnam crisis must be made on initiative Vietnamese nationalists themselves. We emphasized U.S. view that present govt, as legally constituted govt, must be supported as long as it remains such and that urgent problem is to deal with present civil war and not question of form of any new govt.</p>
<p>4. De agreed fully with our remarks pointing out that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s decisions of previous day were in keeping with these principles. He had made clear to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in summoning him to Cannes before other Vietnamese and in sending personal plane to fetch him that his status as Prime Minister remained unaltered. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> regarded present crisis as being in two phases: First, to bring about end of present civil war and second, to deal with question of governmental <pb xml:id="pg_333" n="333" facs="0363"/>reform. First would have to be settled now, second could be dealt with later.</p>
<p>5. Thenceforth, and in conversation immediately following with <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> interview concerned with <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s observations on how to put end civil war rather than any questions alternate govt. or other aspects <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> “plan”.</p>
<p>6. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> stated in strong terms he wished U.S. to take immediate steps persuade <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to come to France to receive Vietnamese leaders with him and discuss means ending present crisis. He stated that correctly or incorrectly <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has claimed that he has had U.S. support in steps he has taken during last few weeks which have led to present bloodshed. He violated truce and at least his brothers if not he himself claimed that he did so with at least passive U.S. support. It was already being said, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> claimed, that U.S. had “by its refusal to countenance any action but blind support for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> allowed present abcess to fester until it had burst in form present civil war and that U.S. had purposely done this in hope <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would take armed action. This action had resulted in deaths of hundreds of innocent people and waste of national force needed to fight Communism. U.S. inaction could no longer be admitted”.</p>
<p>7. All of this we denied, pointing out again that <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> and Embassy Saigon have consistently urged restraint on govt. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> continued, stating that U.S. responsibility in present situation was heavy. He had put off taking action he had wished to take which might have served to avoid present bloodshed at U.S. request. On two successive days U.S. had asked him to refrain from taking decisive action on excuse Washington was studying problem with <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> there and would have something to say shortly. On April 26 and 27 <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> had agreed to our requests and had not taken action which his judgment indicated was necessary. On April 28 he was forced to take matters into his own hands despite third successive request delivered in Cannes on April 28 after shooting had already started. In his opinion if he had acted last week hundreds of lives would have been saved. If U.S. was really neutral in matter it must take steps to avoid giving opposite impression he added. Moreover, if U.S. did not wish to stand by and watch state of civil war established in Vietnam, which would last until Vietminh won complete control, we must help in bringing an end to that civil war. Way to do this is to influence <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to lay down arms and come to France to consult with other Vietnamese anti-Communist nationalists. Moment he does, opposite side will lay down their arms, he claimed.</p>
<p>8. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> alleged that resistance to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is so universal in Vietnam that support of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was serving discredit U.S. in eyes of Vietnamese people. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will undoubtedly succeed in driving sects <pb xml:id="pg_334" n="334" facs="0364"/>out of Saigon or at least in suppressing military forces there but they will simply go to provinces where <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has no control.</p>
<p>9. In <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s opinion <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has now become a psychopath who wishes to martyrize himself even at price of thousands of lives and national treasury. He enjoys thought that his life is in danger and would welcome martyrdom which is indeed what he will get, said <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, for feeling is so intense against him that someone is bound to assassinate him in near future if he persists in trying to establish his rule by force “with the support of no one but his own family and the U.S.”, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> said.</p>
<p>10. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> spoke of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s role as a Catholic, stating that latter regarded his task as leading a holy war. Instead of doing that, he had turned Vietnamese against Catholicism. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> said his wife’s own family had been Catholic for generations and now reported it was unsafe to go outside Saigon if you were known to be a Catholic because of the enmity against <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>
<p>11. We referred to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s refusal to obey <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s summons. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> stated that it did not surprise him. He had expected it and, in a sense, welcomed it as it might serve to clear the air and prove to people that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is not acting as servant of the state as he claimed but rather as a self-seeking War Lord who wished to eradicate all opposition and hold total power within his own hands and that of his family. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> would stake his influence with people and Vietnamese nationalists against <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s.</p>
<p>12. We asked what <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> intended to do if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> continues to disobey his orders. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> stated he would take legal steps to have him declared a rebel and would then proceed to unite the country against him until he was removed from position he was usurping. We asked <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> if he intended to do this in person and if so, would it mean a prompt return to Saigon. He answered that it meant that he might return to Saigon in the near future to lead the fight but that would be dependent on the allegiance of the National Army. Moreover he would take no such step without consulting Vietnamese leaders, whom he had summoned to France next week in advance.</p>
<p>13. We asked what effect <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s refusal to obey his orders would have on arrival in France of other Vietnamese personalities. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> said he hoped that they would all come as it was now more essential than ever that they be consulted in order that country could now achieve the unity <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had failed to achieve. We asked for a list of those invited and it was supplied (being cabled separately<note n="6" xml:id="d160fn6"><p>Transmitted in telegram 4745 from Paris, April 30, which reads as follows:</p>
<p>“List of personalities called Cannes for consultation by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> as released to press by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s Cabinet and published in <hi rend="italic">Nice-Matin</hi> this morning follows: <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai Pope Pham Cong Tac</persName>, Pres of Supreme Praesidium United Sect Front; Gen <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Tran Van Soai</persName>, <gloss target="#t_CINC1">C-in-C</gloss> Hoa Hao troops; Gen <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bai Vien</persName>, Binh Xuyen Chief; Mgr Le Huu Tu, a representative high Buddhist clergy; former <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>s including <persName corresp="#p_TVH1">Tran Van Huu</persName>, Gen Nguyen Van Xuan, Prince <persName corresp="#p_BLP1">Buu Loc</persName>; <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Tran Van Do</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Ho Thong Minh</persName>, former Ministers <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Govt; Ho Van Nut of Tinh-Thanh political group; Nguyen Ton Hoan and Dr <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Phan Huy Quat</persName> of Dai Viet Party; Dr Phan Van Ngoi of Vietnamese Socialist Party; Tran Van Ly, former Governor Central Annam (a Catholic); Dr Nguyen Xuan Chu, Pres Provisional National Council; Tran Van Tuyen of Quoc Dan Dang Party; and former Cabinet Ministers Nguyen Dac Khe, Nguyen Van Tri, and Nguyen Quoc Dinh; Syndicalist representatives including Nguyen Nhon Ung and a representative of <persName>Christian</persName> Un On; and two peasant representatives.” (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/4–3055)</p></note>). It <pb xml:id="pg_335" n="335" facs="0365"/>is noted that contrary to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s first statement April 28 sects have now been invited and all former Prime Ministers except <persName corresp="#p_NVT1">Tam</persName> are included, <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> as well. Bishop Le Huu Tu has been invited but it is not certain he can come. The list includes Buddhists, Catholics, army reps, trade unionists, peasants, etc. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> said it was his intention to make representation broad as possible.</p>
<p>14. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> stated that he had decided on <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName> as special emissary to sects. We pointed out that this decision would come as great shock to American public opinion who looked upon <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName> as rebel against Government. He had had to be removed from Saigon for that reason. It would be interpreted as a sign that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> was sending <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName> as means upsetting National Army’s loyalty to Government. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> said these were interpretations he could not help and that circumstances no longer permitted him to be influenced by them. Fact was, he said, that <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName> enjoyed most support in Vietnam military circles of any Vietnamese general. He had been removed from Vietnam by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> at our request in order give <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> free hand in establishing his authority over the army and in reestablishing law and order and a government of natl union. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> removal of him was best example of extent of effort to give <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> every chance. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had consistently failed. Now it was <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s purpose to end present bloodshed by removing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> from scene and thus preventing National Army from taking further armed action. At same time, he must make certain that sects would desist from similar armed action. He had already taken steps to accomplish former by decree. Only way he could assure latter was by force his own authority backed up by that of man who had greatest influence. Man was <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName> will carry <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s orders for integration of sect forces into National Army and <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> guarantees sects will obey him and message <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName> carries if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is removed from scene.</p>
<p>15. At this stage of interview, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> became so excited that at times he could barely talk. He said that no man had ever enjoyed powers which <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had had from very beginning. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> had transferred all his powers to him. He was fully backed by both France and U.S. He was given large sums of money and his military <pb xml:id="pg_336" n="336" facs="0366"/>forces were clothed, fed and equipped by foreigners. He was constantly helped by foreigners to do things he was incapable of doing himself. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> had all been in his service. Even Chief of Staff of the Vietnam army was removed from scene because <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> didn’t like him. Now things had gone too far and consideration had to be taken of what was best for Vietnamese people and not what was best for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and his family. Vietnam was supposedly an independent country; she must therefore make her own decisions. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> was Chief of State, and intended to carry out his responsibilities as such.</p>
<p>16. We asked what brother <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Luyen</persName> was still doing in Cannes and whether he was serving as intermediary between <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. At this point <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> really exploded and stated that brother <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Luyen</persName> had come to Cannes not for any patriotic purpose as “<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> undoubtedly had told Americans in Saigon,” but rather on secret mission from <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to attempt to buy <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. Some days ago before any action had been taken to summon <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to France or otherwise <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Luyen</persName> arrived uninvited in Cannes, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> kept him waiting and when he finally received him, <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Luyen</persName> offered <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> the sum of three hundred million francs if he would agree not to take any action which would affect status of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> or prevent him from establishing his authority by force. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> commented with indignation that, of course he had refused and “thrown <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Luyen</persName> out of the house” but he was still “grovelling” around. He stated that <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Luyen</persName> had made various allegations of his close relations with “Americans” in Saigon.</p>
<p>17. At end of interview <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> asked if we could give him any further word on Washington’s reaction to plan submitted week ago. We explained once more that <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> was leaving Washington that day for Saigon which was sufficient evidence of Washington’s recognition of emergency nature of situation there. It was obvious that no decisions would now be reached until <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName> had arrived in Saigon and could confer there with Embassy and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>. In meanwhile we informed <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> that his observations would be passed to Dept in their entirety.</p>
<p>18. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> said he would send De back to Paris Monday in order to remain in touch with us and to receive any observations Washington cared to make to him. At same time he would instruct De to keep US au courant.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Report on <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> Visit and Viet-Nam Situation</item>
</list>
<p>1. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> arrived Thursday, April 21, and left early Friday morning, April 29. He had lunch with the President April 22, saw the Secretary for the first time at a long luncheon meeting April 25. We also met with the Secretary Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. We spent all day Friday, April 22, meeting with <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> with Defense and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> represented. He reiterated even more vigorously and firmly his view, strongly backed by <persName corresp="#p_SPJ1">Sturm</persName>, that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> must be replaced and that a plan of action should go into effect immediately. They both favored <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>. None of the questions or alternate considerations expressed by any of us at that or any subsequent meetings changed <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ view. Monday morning, April 25, we had a working meeting with him at which (a) I proposed basic question, do we or do we not support some political change in Saigon, and (b) a specific plan of change. The reports at that time from Saigon showed <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was steadily slipping. In the face of the adamant view of <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SPJ1">Sturm</persName> most of us reluctantly accepted the need for a change, but we all insisted that we stay with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> at least for the first innings. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>, and particularly <persName corresp="#p_SPJ1">Sturm</persName>, rejected our proposition in any shape or form. The basic shift in our approach was taken at a long luncheon meeting with the Secretary. Unfortunately neither <persName corresp="#p_HRE1">Bob Hoey</persName> nor I were invited to attend. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Bill Sebald</persName> can fill you in on this. The Secretary took the position we would support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> until and unless genuinely Vietnamese elements turned up with another acceptable solution. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SPJ1">Sturm</persName> later told the working group this was an impossible condition.</p>
<p>2. The rest of Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday we spent working up two long and complicated telegrams to Paris and Saigon.<note n="2" xml:id="d161fn2">Printed as <ref target="#d140">Documents 140</ref> and <ref target="#d141">141</ref>.</note> At a full meeting with the Secretary, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> late Tuesday afternoon they were approved. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> fully endorsed these telegrams after he and <persName corresp="#p_SPJ1">Sturm</persName> had eliminated our proposal to try again to keep <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> as head of a coalition government. These telegrams envisaged a gradual and rather complicated shift of <pb xml:id="pg_338" n="338" facs="0368"/>our position in carefully worked out stages. As we suspected at the time, they were immediately overtaken by events. None of us really believe in them but we were faced with <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ strong recommendations and the fact that he had been to the White House the first day after his arrival. In any event, this shift has never been carried out. Although the telegrams were sent to Paris and Saigon, we have put out a stop order holding up action on them indefinitely.<note n="3" xml:id="d161fn3">See <ref target="#d144">Document 144</ref>.</note></p>
<p>3. Wednesday, April 27, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> changed the police chiefs and Thursday the Binh Xuyen began military action against the government. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and the French have been putting the full blame for this situation on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, as they tried to do for the March 29–30 incident. Events have moved very rapidly since then. The national army has seemed to be winning, groups are rallying to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> is getting set to fire <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, and the French have in effect withdrawn their support from <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. All reports from Saigon indicate there is a revolutionary feeling developing against <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and the French. Some of this is instigated by the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> group but some of it may be spontaneous. As of this writing we may be faced with a choice between <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. In view of the fighting, we have felt in State it was best to continue support for the government under <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and see what happens. But as this crisis develops we are being forced to take a more and more unequivocal and strong stand for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>
<p>4. Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> issued a long statement in support of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> on April 29.<note n="4" xml:id="d161fn4">For a report on <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>’s statement, see <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>, April 30, 1955, U.S. Reiterates Vietnam Backing”.</note> If <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is forced out, <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> would have us stop all aid to Viet-Nam except of a humanitarian nature. Senators Knowland and <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> have also backed <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. A large number of members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee after hearing <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> have informed the Department through Congresswoman Kelly that they would not favor the State Department withdrawing support from <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> met with the Far East Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, separately with Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> and with about a dozen of the House Committee. While he and <persName corresp="#p_SPJ1">Sturm</persName> felt these legislators would give no trouble, <persName corresp="#p_SPJ1">Sturm</persName> informing us after seeing Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> that there was nothing to it, <persName corresp="#p_HRE1">Bob Hoey</persName> and the rest of us here were much less sanguine about legislative feeling. In fact there are going to be real difficulties on the Hill if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is forced out by what appears to be French-<persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> action.</p>
<p>5. During the past ten days the French have been quiet with us, but working behind the scene. <persName corresp="#p_KRA1">Kidder</persName> reports <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> as almost hysterical. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> has been active, as he has submitted one plan to us and has also taken another action publicly. Both of these are almost identical <pb xml:id="pg_339" n="339" facs="0369"/>with plans or ideas which French officials had submitted to us several weeks ago. If there were any notion that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> acts independently of the French and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>, that should now be dispelled. However, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> has indicated to <persName>Dillon</persName> that he has no stomach for going off independently of the US in Free Viet-Nam. They will follow our lead even though they don’t like the idea, providing the situation is not so bad in Saigon that they have to move out French military and civilian personnel. We have asked for pretty fundamental reassurances on basic French intentions in Viet-Nam, we got them orally for whatever they may be worth.</p>
<p>6. We are in a bewildering, fluid situation. I believe more strongly than ever that we should stick with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> now. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> says he is a terrible administrator and it will wreck Free Viet-Nam if we leave him in. That may be true but that is not the issue at present. If <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> can lead the nationalist forces to a conclusive settlement, even to the point of rendering <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> ineffective or annulled, we should continue to support him. The key questions are:</p>
<list>
<item>a) Will the Vietnamese National Army as a group stick with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>?</item>
<item>b) Will the Binh Xuyen be broken up into isolated remnants?</item>
<item>c) Will enough nationalist groups including sect leaders rally to the government even against <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>?</item>
<item>d) Will <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> fire <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, even if the answers to the above three questions are clearly enough in the affirmative?</item>
</list>
<p>What I am afraid of is that the combination of continuing forces coalesced around <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> on the one hand and <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> on the other may not enjoy preponderant strength.</p>
<p>7. There are possibly serious anti-French overtones in the Vietnamese political situation. These also include anti-<persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> feelings, We must not take any action which would tar us with the same accusations. <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName>, our three Attachés, and <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName> informed us on April 30th that “any change in leadership or command at this time could result in chaos”.<note n="5" xml:id="d161fn5">See <ref target="#d156">Document 156</ref>.</note></p>
<p>8. There are some personal aspects that I would like to take up with you privately.</p>

<p>4988. Department’s telegram to Saigon 4826, Paris 3888, London 5597.<note n="2" xml:id="d163fn2"><hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note></p>
<p>1. At 1337 May 1 I called on <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> to deliver message contained reference telegram. Knowing bitterness with which <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> regards <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, I had thought it might be better deliver message to De Rougemont and not again incite <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s anger but De Rougemont not available. In <pb xml:id="pg_341" n="341" facs="0371"/>talking with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>, I found my worst fears fully justified. Not giving me opportunity explain why I had asked see him, he inquired whether I had seen <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and what <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had said. I outlined to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s account of the events of April 30 and morning May 1 (Embassy telegrams 4957<note n="3" xml:id="d163fn3">Dated May 1, not printed. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/5–155)</note> and 4951<note n="4" xml:id="d163fn4">Dated April 30, not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/4–3055)</note>) and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s apprehension regarding possibility of trouble between French and Vietnamese. I said <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> particularly feared continued presence armed Binh Xuyen units in French security zone creates potentially explosive situation.</p>
<p>2. Upon my mentioning possibility of trouble between French and Vietnamese, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> immediately launched upon what can only be described as violent tirade. He said it obvious <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had called me in for express purpose of warning me against possibility of trouble and I would be naive if I did not realize this meant that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was planning trouble and covering himself in advance. Pointing his finger at me and speaking with extreme severity <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that as representative of the only country which could have any influence on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> I should immediately go to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and tell him that if any trouble should occur tonight, responsiblity would be solely <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s. I protested that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> himself had told me he feared incidents with French and that they must be prevented at all costs. If I should then go to him and tell him he would be responsible for any trouble that might take place I would to all intents and purposes be calling him a liar. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s reply was, “He is a liar and you should tell him exactly that.” I replied I shared both <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s apprehension. I said I would see <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and would, after referring to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s apprehensions, urge <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> take every possible action, including public appeal for calm and issuance of orders to his soldiers to avoid any action which might provoke incidents. I said, however, I would not and could not tell <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in advance of any incident that such incident was his full responsibility or that he was lying. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s only reply was to reiterate his previous statement with great vehemence.</p>
<p>3. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> asked me if I realized depths to which <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> going in spreading lies about French. I told him I was aware of extent of anti-French propaganda but that I did not know who was responsible for it but did not believe that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> himself was. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> is convinced that, if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> himself is not responsible, at least someone close to him is. (<hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> This is doubtless true.) He showed me copy of tract issued by “Les Nationalistes Militaires de la Juste Cause Nationale”, which states in part, “French colonialists go home. French military have been found on side Binh Xuyen pirates fighting against Vietnamese National Army. Stop your double game which consists of holding hand with Viet Minh in north and passing yourself off officially as <pb xml:id="pg_342" n="342" facs="0372"/>friends of Vietnamese nationalists in south . . . Vietnamese Army has nothing to fear from those who lost battle of Dien Bien Phu . . .<note n="5" xml:id="d163fn5">Ellipses in the source text.</note>”</p>
<p>4. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> It is quite understandable that man of such strict honor as <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> has become enraged and, in my judgment, has become so personally and emotionally involved that the more unrestrained of his comments must be taken with a certain reserve. His personal sense of insult, added to extremely grave responsibility resting on his shoulders, makes dealing with him delicate matter.</p>
<p>5. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> became extremely bitter and commented that he had thought our governments were following joint policy. I felt obligated at that juncture to affirm that I am under instructions to do everything I can to cooperate with French in joint policy, objective of which is support of legal government of Vietnam of which head is <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> but that I must point out in all frankness that our government continues to support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> whereas French do not. Here, I said, is basic divergence in policy. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> must realize, I added, that in addition to my responsibility for close cooperation with French, a policy I fully approve of and to which I have consistently given my best support, I was also under obligation to support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government. I reiterated that I could not do as <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> requested. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> retorted in some anger that there is involved more than a question of incidents which he expects <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to instigate during coming night, with danger not only to French lives but to American. Protection of interests of free world and the fight against communism is at stake. If present situation is allowed continue, he said, Viet Minh will have control of Saigon in matter of days. He said French have proof Viet Minh play important role in revolutionary committee and have infiltrated <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s entourage. In interest free world I was under obligation, he said, go beyond any instructions I may have.</p>
<p>6. <persName corresp="#p_VLG1">Van Laethem</persName>, who was with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> during entire interview and joined in extreme pressure on me, then stated, speaking vehemently, that all this bloodshed could have been avoided if US had taken some action to find political solution in concert with French three or four weeks ago after French decided impossible work any further with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> commented that he had thought we had had joint policy when <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> left for Washington, as he and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> had then agreed <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> must go. I told <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_VLG1">Van Laethem</persName> that I could not accept what appeared to me to be their attempt saddle US with full responsibility for present situation and that they must have misunderstood Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ position. I said that <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> had agreed with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> that situation extremely serious, that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> prestige and position had been deteriorating rapidly, that our support of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> must <pb xml:id="pg_343" n="343" facs="0373"/>be reviewed and alternate solutions thoroughly canvassed. I pointed out that at end of last interview with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> prior <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ departure, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> had carefully reiterated that he had no authority state that our position with regard to support of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had changed as that was not the case. At this point I delivered message contained Department telegram 4826. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> so concerned about possibility incidents between French and Vietnamese he seemed scarcely take in message. He did however comment bitterly on influence of people like Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>. I do not believe <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> has any concept of public opinion in US as it affects <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> problem. I have attempted remedy this failing.</p>
<p>7. I decided it was time break up interview but before I departed <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> restated very emphatically that I must realize the very grave responsibility resting on my shoulders as representative in Vietnam of US and that if I did not do as he, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>, had suggested, responsibility for what might happen during coming night would be mine. I replied again that I could not accept any such statement but that in our common interest I would see <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and talk with him along lines I had outlined earlier in our talk.</p>
<p>8. During my conversation with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, reported Embassy telegram 4984,<note n="6" xml:id="d163fn6">Dated May 1, not printed. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/5–155)</note> I did exactly what I had committed myself to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> to do. I told <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that, worried by what he had said regarding his fears of trouble with French, I had gone directly to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and that I could assure him, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> was taking all possible precautions avoid incidents and that I hoped <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was acting similarly. Trouble between French and Vietnamese could redound only to advantage of Viet Minh and would have serious, if not tragic, effects on position of not only France and Vietnam, but US in Free Vietnam. I suggested that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> issue explicit orders to all troops to take special precautions avoid any actions which might provoke trouble and that he might consider issuing general appeal to people explaining necessity avoid incidents. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> replied that it might be worthwhile if he and French could get together on some type declaration. I asked if he had been in touch with French regarding this problem. When he said he had not, I urged him make contact with French as soon as possible, pointing out that when both sides are apprehensive, frictions may occur much more easily when there has been a failure both sides discuss their mutual problem and seek joint solution.</p>
<p>9. After talk with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> I requested De Rougemont to call, as I did not wish again become involved in fruitless polemic with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>. I told De Rougemont what had transpired and suggested that if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, already preoccupied by numerous other problems, did not get in touch with French that French themselves should take initiative and <pb xml:id="pg_344" n="344" facs="0374"/>that I thought they had responsibility so to do. De Rougemont said he would transmit my information and suggestions to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>.</p>
<p>10. Following my talk with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and before my conversation with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, reported above, British Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SSHS1">Stephenson</persName> and Australian Minister McNicol called. After I had left <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>, latter had called in <persName corresp="#p_SSHS1">Stephenson</persName> and had outlined to him something of his conversation with me. <persName corresp="#p_SSHS1">Stephenson</persName> and McNicol, fully realizing importance of problem, wished discuss with me possible approach to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. Their suggestions were definitely helpful to me in subsequent talk with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and both of them agreed with me in my suggested approach. <persName corresp="#p_SSHS1">Stephenson</persName> had already been apprised of contents of Department telegram to Saigon 4826 and I gave McNicol gist of message, as he has been consistently extremely helpful throughout current crisis.</p>
<p>11. I should like add my deep appreciation thoughtfulness and support expressed Department telegram 4822.<note n="7" xml:id="d163fn7">Dated April 30, this telegram reads as follows: “Department commends you for your cool and capable handling of delicate situation under tense and critical conditions.

<p>4831. To <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> from Secretary.</p>
<p>1. Events in past few days have put Vietnamese situation in broader and different perspective than when you were here. It is now no longer simply a question of whether and under what conditions <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government should be altered. In the US and the world at large <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> rightly or wrongly is becoming symbol of Vietnamese nationalism struggling against French colonialism and corrupt backward elements. Rightly or wrongly <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> by his recent measures gives the appearance of acting in league with these forces and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is emerging as popular hero here.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_345" n="345" facs="0375"/>
<p>2. Since your departure US public and Congressional opinion, in view of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s apparent success in the current military and political battle, is now even less likely than before to support or countenance a removal of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> forced from without. There is increasing Congressional support for Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>’s views with which you are already familiar.</p>
<p>3. For us at this time to participate in a scheme to remove <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would not only be domestically impractical but highly detrimental our prestige in Asia. Reported developments, if confirmed and if followed through to a successful conclusion, would appear to overtake some of the principal reasons previously advanced for US to support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s removal.</p>
<p>4. In this situation we believe that indigenous and nationalist political forces in Saigon and Vietnam should be allowed to work out a solution. It may transpire that a broad-based and acceptable government with or without <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will evolve out of present crisis. We do not desire to support measures tending to undercut government elements.</p>
<p>5. Accordingly we believe you should at this juncture:</p>
<list>

<p rend="center">The Estimate</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Implications of Current Developments in Saigon</p>
<p>1. The success of Premier <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in operations against the Binh Xuyen, and in his stand against <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, the French, and General <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Vy</persName>, has created a new and potentially revolutionary situation in Vietnam. While the situation in Vietnam is extremely fluid, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> appears to hold the initiative in the phase that is about to begin. In this phase, the interested parties—particularly the French and <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>—will have to adapt themselves to a radically new political situation dominated by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> or by more extreme nationalist elements. If they do not adapt and if there are any substantial efforts by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> or the <pb xml:id="pg_347" n="347" facs="0377"/>French to frustrate <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s government, the chances of anti-French violence and the deposal of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> would be greatly increased.</p>
<p>2. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s relations with the Revolutionary Council<note n="3" xml:id="d165fn3">On April 30, a gathering of 200 people met in the Saigon Town Hall and constituted themselves the “General Assembly of the democratic and revolutionary forces of the nation”. They called for <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s abdication, a new government under <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, withdrawal of the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>, and elections for a national assembly. The General Assembly elected a “Revolutionary Committee” of 33 members who immediately went to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to submit their demands.</note> which has been actively injecting itself into this situation have not yet been clarified. This council, designated by a self-appointed assembly, takes a more extreme position than <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, particularly in regard to the withdrawal of French forces and the immediate deposal of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. It is dominated by <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> Generals <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Trinh Minh The</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Nguyen Thanh Phuong</persName> and by Hoa Hao General <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> and includes a number of extreme nationalist politicians. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> now charges that the Council is Communist infiltrated but so far has not produced evidence to substantiate this charge. We have no significant evidence to indicate that any of the members of the Council are Communist. In a proclamation the Council announced a broad program couched in social revolutionary terms but including a denunciation of “red colonialism” in North Vietnam. Its activities have been denounced by the Communist radio in Hanoi as have those of Premier <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Probable Courses of Action of Interested Parties</p>
<p>3. <hi rend="italic">Premier <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName></hi>. The virtual expulsion of the Binh Xuyen from Saigon–Cholon has increased <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s prestige throughout Vietnam. The confidence of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and his supporters in their own strength, judgment, and popular appeal has been considerably enhanced. In this situation, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will almost certainly continue to resist any efforts to remove him from office.</p>
<p>4. His actions and those of his followers have taken on an increasingly nationalistic, anti-French tone over the past few days and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> may now be convinced that a continuation of this anti-French policy is essential to the rallying of popular support. Nevertheless, he has exercised a moderating influence on the anti-French and anti-<persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> position of the Revolutionary Council. However, if he believed the French were continuing their efforts to depose him, he would almost certainly permit intensified anti-French manifestations. Such a course would carry grave dangers of anti-French violence, particularly in Saigon.</p>
<p>5. So far, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and his principal Vietnamese National Army (<gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss>) leaders have appeared desirous of maintaining good relations with the French. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s attitude toward <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> has been less clear and there have been indications that he has been considering the <pb xml:id="pg_348" n="348" facs="0378"/>suggestions of the Council that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> be deposed. He may be using ultranationalism to bring pressure against <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and the French. If he is thwarted in his objectives by the French or by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, he will become more susceptible to pressures toward extreme action.</p>
<p>6. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has rallied additional support during the current military phase, and from this position of strength, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will almost certainly continue to gain adherents, including defections from among the Binh Xuyen and the sects.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">7. The Vietnamese National Army</hi>. Aside from the French Army, only the <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> presently has the capability to enforce <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s authority in Saigon or to back <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in defiance of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. There are some <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> officers who dislike <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and who are concerned by the developing rift between <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. On the other hand, there is considerable pro-<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, nationalist sentiment in the army; <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has gained additional support as a result of clearing the Binh Xuyen from Saigon; and most importantly, the <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> units in the Saigon area appear to be loyal to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>
<p>8. If <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should move precipitously to depose <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, or if <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> attempted to oust <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, some elements of the army might remain loyal to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and attempt to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. We believe such efforts would be unsuccessful, however, even if General <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName> had entered the country to rally support for <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">9. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName></hi> As a result of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s stand against <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and because of the latter’s involvement in what many Vietnamese nationalists consider to be a French-inspired political maneuver, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s prestige has been greatly reduced, whatever the outcome of the present crisis. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s authority can only be enforced at this juncture by the force of French arms and any such action would almost completely discredit him in Vietnam.</p>
<p>10. There appears to be considerable sentiment for the deposal of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, and if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> gives his consent such action may be taken at any time. For the present, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> apparently feels that the tide is running with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, and is attempting to preserve the institution of the monarchy by accepting the continuation of the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government.</p>
<p>11. <hi rend="italic">The French Government</hi>. The French will find it difficult to accept <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s success which came despite their strong and well-publicized opposition. We believe that fear of large-scale violence and of adverse domestic and world reactions will cause the French to refrain from overt action in Saigon to restrain the <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> or to remove <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, unless the situation should threaten serious loss of French lives. However, the extent to which the French permit the <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> freedom of action and the nature of their dealings with the Binh Xuyen and <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> can still have an influence on the outcome of the immediate <pb xml:id="pg_349" n="349" facs="0379"/>situation. Furthermore, we believe that the French will continue pressures for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s removal; some French elements in Vietnam are likely to continue their covert assistance to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s enemies. If the French believe that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will succeed in consolidating his position, they may decide that they have no choice except to repair their position with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> as best they can while making plans for accelerated withdrawal of their forces.<note n="4" xml:id="d165fn4">The Special Assistant, Intelligence, Department of State, believes that the last sentence of this paragraph understates the difficulty the French would have in accommodating to a strong, anti-French government in South Vietnam, and therefore believes the sentence should read: “If these efforts are unsuccessful and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> appeared to be consolidating his position, the French in the end may decide that they have no choice except to step up the withdrawal of their forces from Vietnam.” [Footnote in the source text.]</note></p>
<p>12. <hi rend="italic">The Binh Xuyen</hi>. The military potential of the Binh Xuyen will depend on the extent of support they receive, directly or indirectly, from the French and the Hoa Hao. It appears that the morale of the Binh Xuyen troops is low, a number have already defected, and that many of the troops may be susceptible to peace offers from the government. We believe that a considerable number of the Binh Xuyen may attempt to resume their life of piracy and extortion. The <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> should be able to reduce the Binh Xuyen to the level of local nuisance.</p>
<p>13. <hi rend="italic">The Sects</hi>. We believe that for the immediate future the <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> military forces under Generals <persName corresp="#p_TM1">The</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName> will continue actively to support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> against the Binh Xuyen and <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. The Hoa Hao are unlikely to play an important role in the immediate situation, although the <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName> forces may continue their terrorist operations.</p>
<p>14. <hi rend="italic">The Viet Minh</hi>. The Viet Minh probably fear that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s continuation in office would limit the prospects of a peaceful unification of Vietnam under terms favorable to the Communists. They will probably continue covert efforts in South Vietnam to keep the situation agitated. The Communists almost certainly will not invade South Vietnam in the near future.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">General Outlook</p>
<p>15. In present circumstances, we do not believe that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could be persuaded voluntarily to resign. If he were forced from office, many of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s followers would probably undertake revolutionary opposition, including maquis resistance, to the successor regime. Some <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> elements in Saigon and in central Vietnam would probably join these elements in resisting the new government.</p>
<p>16. Assuming that the US continues to support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, and that the French acquiesce, we believe the situation will stabilize in Saigon <pb xml:id="pg_350" n="350" facs="0380"/>under <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s control. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s talents as an administrator are unlikely to improve. His success, achieved largely on his own initiative and with his own resources, is likely to make him more independent and less amenable to policy guidance. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s government will still be confronted with manifold internal problems—e.g., integration of the sects, resettlement of refugees, land reform, extension of government authority in the provinces, and training of the army. Although <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has improved his position, we believe that it will still be extremely difficult, at best, for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> or any Vietnamese government to build sufficient strength to meet the long-range challenge of the Communists.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Conversation on Current Political Problems</item>
</list>
<p>1. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MDM1">MacDonald</persName> opened the conversation by referring to the Revolutionary Committee of the People of Vietnam which has issued a proclamation stating that it no longer recognizes <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, advocating that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> turn over his powers to the Committee and then undertake to form a new government. <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> Generals <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Trinh Minh The</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName> are prominent in this group.</p>
<p>2. <persName corresp="#p_MDM1">MacDonald</persName> said that the British Embassy has had a study made of the composition and political sentiments of the members of this group. They have feared Viet Minh infiltration. So far they have turned out the name of only one person they believe to be a Viet Minh—Pho. There is another, <persName>Thanh</persName>, head of the Legal Association, who is questionable, both, I gather, as to membership in the Committee and as to Viet Minh affiliations. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> said we likewise were making a study on the subject and that Americans and British should coordinate their activities. He outlined to <persName corresp="#p_MDM1">MacDonald</persName> <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s apprehension regarding the Committee and particularly <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Trinh Minh The</persName>.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_351" n="351" facs="0381"/>
<p>3. <persName corresp="#p_MDM1">MacDonald</persName> said he had talked with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and had urged him to attempt to maintain best possible relations with all groups with a view to forming a broader based government of national union. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_MDM1">MacDonald</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> had been insulting to him in his messages and talked about the National Front. <persName corresp="#p_MDM1">MacDonald</persName> got the impression that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would like to see <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> deposed but he would not say so directly. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> commented that the Revolutionary Committee represents nobody except its members and that only an elected National Assembly could be in a position to express the national will with regard to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> said that we must look ahead and ask ourselves whether <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> with all his well-known failings could be expected to be able to run a government any more efficiently than he had in the past. Until there is a National Assembly the removal of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> has great potential danger.</p>
<p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MDM1">MacDonald</persName>, who has always been one of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s most stalwart champions, said <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> has lost much ground even in the last week, that through his recent blunders he has “shot his bolt” for the time being, but we should hope that he will not be overthrown as he may still be useful.</p>
<p>5. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> outlined to <persName corresp="#p_MDM1">MacDonald</persName> the present United States position as reflected in <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 4831.<note n="2" xml:id="d166fn2"><ref target="#d164">Document 164</ref>.</note> He also outlined to <persName corresp="#p_MDM1">MacDonald</persName> the attempts he had made prior to his return to Washington to synthesize various Vietnamese proposals starting with that of <persName corresp="#p_NVT2">Thoai</persName> for the establishment of an interim government pending compilation [completion?] of a partially-elected assembly.</p>
<p>6. Reference was made to the conciliatory nature of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s last message to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>,<note n="3" xml:id="d166fn3">Not found.</note> copy of which none of us has yet seen. <persName corresp="#p_SSHS1">Stephenson</persName> said that the radio this morning reported that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> intended to return to Vietnam when order has been restored.</p>
<p>7. As <persName corresp="#p_MDM1">MacDonald</persName> is seeing <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> again this afternoon, the problem of what he should emphasize to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> was discussed. It was agreed that he should urge <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> to find some method by which the three Binh Xuyen posts in the French Security Zone might be evacuated, and that he might further suggest that if the French consider it still necessary to maintain liaison with Binh Xuyen they should at least explain the nature of this liaison to the Vietnamese and limit the number of men involved.</p>
<p>8. <persName corresp="#p_MDM1">MacDonald</persName> said he had seen <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> this morning. <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>, with his group of intellectuals, is preparing a program which they intend to announce after talking with the French, British and ourselves. The program will recommend (1) that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> return his powers to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName><pb xml:id="pg_352" n="352" facs="0382"/>from whom he received them, and (2) that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> return to Vietnam to form a new government. After discussion of the <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> program, <persName corresp="#p_MDM1">MacDonald</persName> agreed that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> should discourage <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_MDM1">MacDonald</persName> told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> that the latter could so inform <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d166fn4">No memorandum has been found of a subsequent conversation between <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>.</note></p>

<p>5030. Ref Paris tel 4767, repeated Saigon 697.<note n="2" xml:id="d167fn2">In this telegram, May 2, the Embassy in Paris reported that Berard had read to <persName corresp="#p_ATC1">Achilles</persName> excerpts from a telegram from <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> quoting <persName corresp="#p_KRA1">Kidder</persName> as stating that Franco-American cooperation in Saigon was no longer possible. Berard expressed deep concern with <persName corresp="#p_KRA1">Kidder</persName>’s attitude and with the activities of <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName>. Berard charged that <persName corresp="#p_KRA1">Kidder</persName>, and particularly <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName>, had not merely failed to try to restrain <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, but had encouraged him to take armed action. <persName corresp="#p_ATC1">Achilles</persName> doubted, according to the reporting telegram, whether <persName corresp="#p_KRA1">Kidder</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName> would have encouraged <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.

<p>1. Since my arrival Saigon I have reviewed all messages sent Dept in my absence and have discussed events past week with all US agency chiefs.</p>
<p>2. I am convinced that <persName corresp="#p_KRA1">Kidder</persName> has conducted himself extremely well during my absence, not only did he follow American policy, but he showed judgment and restraint in discussions with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_VLG1">Van Laethem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_KRA1">Kidder</persName> confirms that he made no such statement as attributed to him by <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>, though he did point out differences in our point of view as to support of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. Conversation this morning with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SSHS1">Stephenson</persName> confirms fact that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> was highly excited and emotional during this period.</p>
<p>3. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> was completely calm yesterday during our discussion, but did make one slight reference to <persName corresp="#p_KRA1">Kidder</persName>, who was present. I immediately stated that <persName corresp="#p_KRA1">Kidder</persName> had done no more nor less than I would have done, and that I fully supported his actions. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> did not press the point, but <persName corresp="#p_VLG1">Van Laethem</persName> became so satirical in answering my questions with respect to “proof” of alleged Viet Minh penetration into <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> entourage, that I had to speak rather sharply to him.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_353" n="353" facs="0383"/>
<p>4. French have sniped at <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName> ever since I have been here. I have consistently defended him and will continue to do so. He has performed a highly useful service and has definitely been a restraining influence not only on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> but on such characters as <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Trinh Minh The</persName>, who has a strong anti-French bias. We must maintain contact with people like <persName corresp="#p_TM1">The</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName> is our best agent for this purpose.</p>
<p>5. This attitude of Berard’s, which reflects <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s irritation with US policy towards <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, is one of the most disturbing developments which has transpired during the current crisis.<note n="3" xml:id="d167fn3">The Department of State, in telegram 3940 to Paris, repeated to Saigon, May 5, rejected Berard’s “insinuations and allegations” and the Embassy in Paris was instructed to inform the French that in view of forthcoming discussions on Vietnam, such personal recriminations were regrettable and ill-timed. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/5–2555)</note> At my weekly staff meeting this morning I was somewhat shocked at the strong anti-French feeling among the staff officers present as a result of incidents of the past week. I am studying this situation, as well as the widening breach between the Vietnamese and the French, in an attempt to determine what can be done by ourselves and the French to curb these growing frictions, which if permitted to grow could have disastrous results. I will report further on this in my overall evaluation of the situation sometime tomorrow.<note n="4" xml:id="d167fn4">Apparently the reference is to the observations in <ref target="#d173">Document 173</ref>.</note></p>

One of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s themes was that popular opinion in Vietnam, as expressed by the “Revolutionary Committee”, wanted the removal of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> as head of state. “<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> suggested US Government recommend to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> to resign his powers in favor of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.

<p>1. Tide presently may be running in favor <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government provided “revolutionary committee” or any “Estates General” does not get out of hand. Challenge of rebel Binh Xuyen successfully met. National Army appears united in support legal government. Many political personalities and factions including <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> have rallied to government. U.S. has maintained support for governmental authority. However, premature or precipitate action might reverse present trend to the disadvantage of government.</p>
<p>2. We would like the following conveyed to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>:</p>
<list>
<item>A. If <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> relies on hastily organized ad hoc group such as revolutionary committee or “Estates General”, action to depose <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> could set precedent and open way for later removal of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> by same or similar group, including Viet Minh. Authority over army is crucial factor in present situation and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> might wish to consider carefully how <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> might still serve to consolidate <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s authority. To proceed with proposed action before <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is assured of solid backing of Vietnamese people might open door to greater confusion, set government adrift in uncontrollable currents, and lead to ultimate Viet Minh triumph through subversion and infiltration.</item>
<item>B. Crucial task for Vietnamese nationalists is to consolidate support of army and to move ahead rapidly to translate paper plans and decrees into concrete actions backed up with adequate organization at the village level. As long as Viet Minh is hampered in the North by various real handicaps such as lack of rice and mass repudiation by hundreds of thousands of refugees, the South has possible opportunity to gain the upper hand politically if the Vietnamese nationalists can rally together effectively to strengthen Free Viet-Nam.</item>
<item>C. Accordingly, we counsel moderation on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. And we will counsel restraint and moderation likewise on <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and French. Future U.S. support for Viet-Nam will be predicated on our assessment degree of genuinely broad popular support and ability to deal responsibly and constructively with fundamental problems shown by nationalist, anti-Communist government. The U.S. is stressing this to all parties concerned.</item>
</list>
<p>3. <hi rend="italic">For Embassy Paris:</hi> We hope French will exercise restraint in present situation. After informing French of substance above omitting any reference to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s request for U.S. position as outlined reference telegram, make clear to them the immediate pressing requirement is for U.S. and France cooperate in supporting <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s government’s authority. If French or <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> take measures against <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> or show evident disapproval of his government, it might push <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to point where he may find it imperative to allow or take action against <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> or French, in order to maintain his own personal authority. In this event, whether or not <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> or the Viet Minh come out <pb xml:id="pg_355" n="355" facs="0385"/>on top, position French would be lost. Recall of <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName><note n="4" xml:id="d168fn4">General <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s emissary, had been expected to arrive in Saigon on May 1, but instead he landed in Phnom Penh.</note> immediately to France by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> would be useful demonstration willingness cooperate.</p>
<p>4. At <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ discretion if he believes useful we suggest he convey <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that we would hope that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could immediately announce reorganized, broader government which would have administrative and political capabilities, unquestionable nationalist and anti-Communist orientation, determination to carry out seven-point reform program energetically, and capability to carry out program for the integration of the sects into the modern life of Viet-Nam and the convoking of provisional national assembly as soon as possible.</p>

Secret. Drafted by <persName corresp="#p_SPJ1">Sturm</persName> on May 5.</note></head>
<p>1. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> called on Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> at noon, May 4, at his own request. He began conversation by expressing regret for the death of General <persName corresp="#p_TM1">The</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> appeared to be deeply concerned by <persName corresp="#p_TM1">The</persName>’s death and referred to him as a “moderate element.” <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> went on to say with respect to <persName corresp="#p_TM1">The</persName>’s death that <persName corresp="#p_TM1">The</persName> had refused to use an armored car or to take shelter against enemy fire. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> said that, unfortunately, [name deleted] had told Colonel Gebhart<note n="2" xml:id="d170fn2">Lieutenant Colonel John F. Gebhart, Assistant Army Attaché.</note> that shot killing <persName corresp="#p_TM1">The</persName> came from a French river boat. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> immediately left the room to speak to [name deleted]. When he returned, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> said he was pleased by [name deleted] [<hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s</hi>?] prompt reaction. As [name deleted] came into the room, he said he had a story from <persName corresp="#p_TM1">The</persName>’s men that <persName corresp="#p_TM1">The</persName> had been shot from the back. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> said that he viewed this rumor as serious. It was bad for <persName corresp="#p_TM1">The</persName>’s memory and could only tend to stir up dangerous anti-French feeling. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> broke in to say that [name deleted] should consult him before making such statements, even if they were true. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> went on to say that if such stories were true, he would make the necessary statements.</p>
<p>2. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> described a conversation he had had with <persName corresp="#p_JVAEA1">Admiral Jozan</persName> in which he complained that two Navy launches had delivered munitions on May 1 to Binh Xuyen. Moreover, Binh Xuyen launches had taken shelter May 3 beside certain French vessels. <persName corresp="#p_JVAEA1">Jozan</persName> denied the report regarding the transfer of munitions. He also said that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> had not discussed with him the question of recovering former French launches from the Binh Xuyen.</p>
<p>3. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that he was very much concerned by the anti-French press campaign now underway. He said it was not only dangerous to the French but rendered the US position <pb xml:id="pg_357" n="357" facs="0387"/>much more difficult. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said that, on May 3 in a radio address, he had counseled moderation. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> said that, nevertheless, the Vietnamese press was still printing inflammatory articles which <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could stop through press censorship. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said he would speak to Information Minister Thai. However, any reduction in the anti-French press campaign would have to be brought about slowly since Vietnamese officers had had serious trouble with the French.<note n="3" xml:id="d170fn3">In a memorandum of a conversation held with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> the previous day, <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName> wrote: “I drew sparks from the President with my remarks about the anti-French propaganda. He pointed out that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> had raised the same point and wondered why we Americans were putting this burden on the Vietnamese, when the French actions had been so provocative. (In other words, why didn’t we go to work on the French to stop being so provocative?)” (Memorandum for the Record by <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName>; <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> Papers, Vietnam File, Series VII, <gloss target="#t_L1">L</gloss>)</note></p>

<p>5047. 1. During course of call on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> at noon May 4<note n="2" xml:id="d171fn2">See the memorandum, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> I told <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> we, French and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> were disturbed by Revolutionary Committee and possibility of Viet Minh involvement in it. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> admitted that some of committee members had once been in Viet Minh but denied that any were now affiliated. He added that committee had desired take drastic independent action to depose <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, demand evacuation of <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> and call for elected assembly. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, however, had told committee he must convoke provincial representatives, explaining to me that his objective was to surround committee radicals with more moderate elements. I warned <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> committee constituted real threat to his govt. He conceded committee members were “ambitious and over excited”, but went on to say that “everyone” is against <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. Committee members, who wished <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> resign his powers to them, were not pleased with his decision to call in provincial representatives. He said committee had in effect disintegrated May 3 <pb xml:id="pg_358" n="358" facs="0388"/>when more moderate members withdrew pending arrival of provincial delegates, and mass meeting held late afternoon May 3 had succeeded in attracting only 500 participants.</p>
<p>2. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> went on to say that “Congress”, which would consist of Revolutionary Committee augmented by provincial delegates, should be encouraged to put forth moderate motions, but that no one could prevent it from demanding that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> resign as Chief of State. I asked <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> what the effect of such motion would be. He said <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> would have to decide quickly to resign his powers, as he abdicated in 1946 to Viet Minh. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said he, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, was convoking congress since otherwise it would convene “spontaneously”. He said that in center Vietnam “everyone” is against <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, even members of Imperial Guard.</p>
<p>3. I told <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> this course of action would pose serious problems for US, particularly if <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> refused to abide by decision of congress as forecast by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. I asked who in <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s view would take place of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, what the form of govt would be, and what could serve as element of continuing legality. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> answered only that unless congress met and acted, there would be grave “troubles”. I said that it appeared to be <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> himself was proposing to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> through medium of this congress which is not an elected body representative of Vietnamese people. I did not believe US could support such action on part of revolutionary junta. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> replied that if he did not go along, congress would meet and take action against <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. I said that if congress met, it would be only because he permitted it to do so, and that he would bear full responsibility. I urged that he keep congress in leash until an elected assembly could be constituted. He replied that congress would set up provisional govt to hold office until elections should determine form of Govt.</p>
<p>4. I said I must report this decision on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s part to Washington at once, but meanwhile urged him not to permit congress to convene under conditions he had outlined. In my view such action would be interpreted as a coup d’état for which he could not escape responsibility. The purpose of the congress as I saw it was to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and set up <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s stead. He asked what alternative there was. I said he should continue to govern as at present, hold elections when he could, and let National Assembly decide these matters. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> was interfering with him and trying to keep him from governing. He said <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Vy</persName> had tried to execute a coup at <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s direction and Chief of State had sent <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName> to investigate conditions surrounding hostilities with Binh Xuyen. I replied that these mistakes on <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s part did not warrant <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s making an even graver mistake. He is still running country. Why alienate his friends by usurping proper function of an elected assembly? I warned <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that committee or congress which overthrew <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName><pb xml:id="pg_359" n="359" facs="0389"/>could also overthrow him if it deemed expedient. I said that any new govt set up under these conditions would be devoid of legality and that he himself would become captive of Revolutionary Committee. I urged him to reconsider and not make serious mistake of surrendering to committee. If congress were summoned, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should see to it that at most it call for elections to be followed by National Assembly.</p>
<p>5. Despite fact I repeatedly urged <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> take no action which would make US position in Vietnam very difficult, if not impossible, I cannot feel my words had much effect on him. It appears to me that he and his advisors are determined to get rid of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, promptly and at all costs, unless we bring the heaviest pressure to bear on him, including threat of withdrawal of recognition and suspension of aid. In a separate telegram now in preparation I am making point that there may no longer be any possibility of achieving concerted Franco-US policy in Vietnam so long as <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> remains in office.<note n="3" xml:id="d171fn3">Apparent reference to the drafting of <ref target="#d173">Document 173</ref>.</note> Without rehearsing arguments made there, I feel certain that unless we make strenuous efforts avert action on which <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is embarked, it will be out of the question to salvage any part of our cooperation with French here.</p>
<p>6. Above was prepared prior to receipt of <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 4867.<note n="4" xml:id="d171fn4"><ref target="#d168">Document 168</ref>.</note> You will note that I spoke to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> more strongly than instructions contained in 4867 would seem to authorize. However, I limited my remarks as being by own views (in this connection, I had not seen <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 5031<note n="5" xml:id="d171fn5">In this telegram of May 3, sent in the first person in <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ name, the Embassy reported its response to a request by Colonel Thai, Minister of Information, as to the U.S. attitude toward the Revolutionary Committee’s announced plan to depose <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. The second paragraph reads as follows: I sent Embassy officer to see Thai to inform him US does not and will not support plans Revolutionary Committee depose <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. Question was left open as to what US attitude would be toward actions future duly elected National Assembly which alone could truly claim to be representative of Vietnamese people. It should be for elected National Assembly to decide form of government of Vietnam.” (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/5–355)</note> before dispatch. First sentence of para 2 should have read: “I sent Embassy officer to Thai to inform him that in my judgment US does not and will not support plans Revolutionary Committee depose <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>”). Since I now have official views of Dept I have arranged to see <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> again at 1800 today 4 May and will inform him that I have now received instructions as indicated in <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 4867. This will not only add official weight to my arguments but meeting will afford opportunity for further sensing of effect, if any, my comments had on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s intentions reference “congress”.<note n="6" xml:id="d171fn6"><p>In telegram 5054 from Saigon, dated May 4, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> reported that he had called on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> at 8 p.m. and “explained to him that I now had precise instructions from Department and further informed him that Department regards possibility of overthrow of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> by Revolutionary Committee as highly dangerous procedure. I told him that while committee might today overthrow <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and give powers to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, in three weeks or three months time it might decide replace <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> with someone else and cited case of Kerensky.” At a later point in the conversation, when <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> asked whether a reorganized <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government “would include capable men who did not always agree with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, such as <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>, <persName>Minh</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_NVT2">Thoai</persName>, the reply was contemptuous; <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> and <persName>Minh</persName> represent nobody and that they are cowards, having resigned rather than face crucial issues.”</p>
<p>The final two paragraphs, which immediately follow on the material just quoted, read:</p>
<p>“8. In breaking off conversation I reiterated two points. First, I urged again necessity <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> use all influence in interest of moderation and, secondly, I told <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that new government had best include men of ability, not necessarily those I cited but men who could get something done as United States would have to assure itself that new government was obtaining results if it were to continue its financial aid.</p>
<p>“9. I left with impression that my afternoon discussion with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had had some moderating effect. This evening he had not repeated his positive assertion that nothing could prevent the Revolutionary Committee and States General from demanding resignation of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/5–455)</p>
<p>The National Congress which met on May 5 passed a number of resolutions, among them one requesting that a national referendum be held to decide whether the State of Vietnam should become a constitutional monarchy or a republic.</p></note></p>

Memorandum of a Conversation Between the Special Representative in Vietnam (<persName corresp="#p_CGJL1" type="from">Collins</persName>) and the French Commissoner-General in Vietnam (<persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1" type="to">Ely</persName>), Saigon, <date when="1955-05-04T18:00:00">May 4, 1955, 6 p.m.</date><note n="1" xml:id="d172fn1" type="source">Source: <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> Papers, Vietnam File, Series VII, S. Secret. Drafted by <persName corresp="#p_SPJ1">Sturm</persName>.</note></head>
<p>1. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> called on <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> at 1800, May 4. He told <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> of his morning call on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s reaction to the story implying French might be responsible for the death of General <persName corresp="#p_TM1">The</persName>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had been disturbed by reports the Binh Xuyen still had launches from which they were firing on National Army troops. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had talked to <persName corresp="#p_JVAEA1">Admiral Jozan</persName> repeating an earlier request that French reclaim these boats from Binh Xuyen. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> reminded <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> that he had some time previously requested <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> see what could be done about removing the launches from Binh Xuyen control. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> replied that the launches were part of the police equipment turned over to the Vietnamese Police (i.e. Binh Xuyen) when police powers were transferred. He said he could not undertake to fight with Binh Xuyen to reclaim these vessels. The boats had long been in Binh Xuyen hands, having originally been French Police, not Navy, equipment. The boats were disarmed prior to transfer and thereafter re-equipped and rearmed by the Binh Xuyen.</p>
<p>2. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> related <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s remarks concerning the Revolutionary Committee and the congress <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has convoked. He said he had urged <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to use his influence on the congress to see <pb xml:id="pg_361" n="361" facs="0391"/>that it acted moderately. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> inquired what the US position would be if the congress turned <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> out. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> replied that he did not know what the US position would be. However, he had instructions from the Department to urge moderation on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he believed the Committee had been set up specifically to eliminate <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> a few days hence. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> said we have no such information. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said that several Cabinet Ministers, mentioning Huyen,<note n="2" xml:id="d172fn2">Possibly Huynh Van Hhiem, Secretary of State for the Interior.</note> have hit on this method for getting rid of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> repeated that we have no such information. He said <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName> had indicated the <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> were the prime movers along with the Viet Minh. Other reports indicated <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s brother, <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>, was deeply involved. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is wary of the Committee, but we have no information indicating it is an immediate threat to him. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> said he did not believe the <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> were primarily responsible for organizing the Revolutionary Committee. He said there is a strong wave of feeling throughout the country against <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, and that the Revolutionary Committee has chosen <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> as its first target before passing on to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> said that he believed it was very difficult to get a balanced estimate of the popular opinion of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. He believed <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had gained in prestige. The Army had remained loyal and had fought, and no civil war had ensued, despite <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s information and predictions. Therefore, he wondered how he should judge <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s information regarding <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> replied that civil war does not develop in forty-eight hours. <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> is now in the maquis and will soon begin guerrilla operations. Two or three National Army battalions had fought so badly as to destroy large quarters of the city. Various army units were of dubious loyalty. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> commented that our contacts indicated the Army had remained loyal. Colonels (now Generals) <persName corresp="#p_TVD2">Don</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DVMC1">Minh</persName> have renounced their French citizenship and seem loyal to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName>, instead of going underground, may wish to settle his quarrel with the goverment peacefully. Accordingly, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> should reevaluate the intelligence on which he had based his previous estimates.</p>
<p>3. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> continued by saying that he was distressed by the build-up of anti-French feeling, which not only could serve no useful purpose, but was highly dangerous. He had cautioned US journalists against this. However, it would be helpful to the French position if <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> could close out the three Binh Xuyen posts remaining in the French zone. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> replied that negotiations had been underway for several days, and that many Binh Xuyen elements had now left the French zone. However, he said he resented implications that he was the Chief of the Binh Xuyen and could give orders accordingly. All he had tried to do was to stop the fighting. He believed <pb xml:id="pg_362" n="362" facs="0392"/>hostilities would not have broken out April 28 if Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> had been in Saigon. Now that events have progressed so far, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> believes all South Vietnam may be lost. However, he agreed that to avoid trouble, it would be advantageous to evacuate the three Binh Xuyen posts.</p>
<p>4. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> said he had received information that the Vietnamese Army had suspended operations against the Binh Xuyen for three or four days. He believed this to be a serious mistake. Moreover, the Vietnamese were moving one or more battalions back into Saigon for the duration of the Congress. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> commented that there was no connection between the Congress and the return of the Vietnamese Army troops to Saigon. General <persName>Minh</persName> had told him that morning hostilities with <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName> had entered an entirely new phase, one of open country guerrilla activity, and that, he, <persName>Minh</persName> did not know whether the army could continue against the Binh Xuyen. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> added that <persName>Minh</persName> had no confidence in certain army battalions and preferred to put the least trustworthy in the line and away from Saigon.</p>

<p>5074. For Secretary from <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>. Re <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 4868, sent Paris 3920.<note n="2" xml:id="d173fn2">In this telegram, May 3, the Department requested from Saigon, in anticipation of the scheduled Franco-American-British talks on Indochina in conjunction with North Atlantic Council meetings in Paris, May 9–11, an estimate of the Vietnam situation and a projection of future developments including the local French position regarding outstanding issues. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/4–3055)</note> Following is summary of Vietnam situation as I see it:</p>
<p>1. Military situation vis-à-vis Binh Xuyen.</p>
<p>A. <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> has driven Binh Xuyen from all posts in Saigon–Cholon except 3 in French controlled zone. I have suggested <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> that he arrange for evacuation these posts and their transfer to National Police and Sûreté as major move to reduce anti-French feeling. Will report any progress this regard soon as obtainable.</p>
<p>B. Unfortunately, after successfully driving Binh Xuyen from Saigon–Cholon and area immediately south thereof, <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> has ceased operations for two or three days. Death of General <persName corresp="#p_TM1">The</persName>, fatigue of troops, “need for regrouping” and alleged near-shortage of artillery <pb xml:id="pg_363" n="363" facs="0393"/>ammo have been offered as reasons for inexcusable failure to crush Binh Xuyen. Respite probably will permit residual Binh Xuyen forces to go underground as French predicted. This could result in dangerous and protracted guerrilla operations.</p>
<p>C. Fortunately so far there has been no indication of moves of <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> to aid Binh Xuyen. <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName>’s forces are quiescent area of Long Xuyen, and there is no indication that <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> units have had any difficulty with Hoa Hao despite fact armed escorts are on infrequent occasions considered prudent for travel in Sadec–Can Tho area.</p>
<p>2. Situation of the United Front (sect).</p>
<p>A. Too early to say whether United Front has definitely broken up. Certainly no effective assistance has been given by either <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> or Hoa Hao to Binh Xuyen. United Front is quiescent for present.</p>
<p>B. Driving force behind United Front was unquestionably <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName>. Unfortunately, <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> permitted escape of <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName>, his political advisor Lai Huu Tai, and former Sûreté Chief <persName corresp="#p_LVSS1">Sang</persName>. Unless they can be either captured, killed, or forced out of country, they remain dangerous elements which could unify the United Front.</p>
<p>3. The Army (<gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss>).</p>
<p>A. Thus far <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> has conducted itself quite well against Binh Xuyen and has remained loyal to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> govt.</p>
<p>B. Tactical movements of <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> were not skillful but consisted largely frontal attacks which permitted escape of Binh Xuyen leaders and withdrawal of substantial forces south of Saigon–Cholon.</p>
<p>C. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s refusal transfer full military powers to <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Vy</persName> has apparently not been further contested by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> in spite his original order and <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Vy</persName> is reported to have gone to Paris after unsuccessfully attempting coup. <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Vy</persName>’s fiasco and strong popular reaction against <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s action sending <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName> back to Vietnam on special mission have reinforced present army leadership which is supporting <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in action against Binh Xuyen.</p>
<p>D. Although certain army leaders, including Generals <persName corresp="#p_TM1">The</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Tran Van Do</persName> and Tran Van Minh signed early Revolutionary Committee Declarations, General <persName corresp="#p_TVD2">Don</persName> now states army wishes remain out of active politics. <persName corresp="#p_TVD2">Don</persName> also says army will not send representatives to Estates General meeting although invited to do so by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>
<p>E. While army has remained loyal to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> until now as head of legal govt, if Revolutionary Committee should seek overthrow <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and should <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> resist this action, effect on loyalty of army is difficult to predict. In such event, there would probably be at least deep split in army ranks with perhaps considerable portion senior officers declaring for <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_364" n="364" facs="0394"/>
<p>F. Fact that army has suspended action against Binh Xuyen is disturbing and may indicate that, for variety of reasons, army is not enthusiastic about engaging in guerrilla warfare against Binh Xuyen.</p>
<p>4. Revolutionary Committee. (See <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtels</gloss> 5047 rptd Paris 1295, 5054 rptd Paris 1299, and 5049 rptd Paris 1296<note n="3" xml:id="d173fn3">For telegram 5047, see <ref target="#d171">Document 171</ref>. In telegram 5049, May 4, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> reported on discussions with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in which, inter alia, he warned <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> not to use the “Revolutionary Committee” to depose <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. In telegram 5054, also May 4, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> summarized the views of local friendly intelligence organizations as to the possibility of Viet Minh infiltration of the “Revolutionary Committee”. With the exception of the French who believed the committee was 80 percent “subverted”, the general view was that it contained a few former pro-Viet Minh members who needed careful watching. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/5–455)</note>) Will advise results of meetings 5 May.</p>
<p>5. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s position.</p>
<p>A. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> has committed major blunders. He has twice ordered <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to France for consultations, sending messages in clear which were widely publicized and which <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has nevertheless successfully resisted. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> in third message which we have not seen, is said to have back-tracked to some extent, explaining he had not meant cast reflections on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, but simply wished to consult with him as <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> before meeting with other nationalist leaders. Fourth message of 4 May, which we have also not seen, is said to be restrained and conciliatory. Second blunder was to name <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Vy</persName> to supersede civil and ranking military authorities as supreme military chief with full military powers. This likewise has backfired. Third blunder, <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName> mission, was particularly stupid in view fact that <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName> had been portrayed as rebel when he was recalled from Vietnam to France by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>.</p>
<p>B. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> is currently object of violent denunciations by so-called Revolutionary Committee and in Saigon vernacular press, where such attacks would not occur without govt inspirations or at least tacit encouragement. Revolutionary Committee’s public proclamation stating <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> deposed as Chief of State has given publicity and impulse to anti-<persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> movement which has always been strong in Cochin China.</p>
<p>C. Should <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> be wise enough to continue show restraint and conciliatory attitude his recent messages have reflected he could be very important asset in restoring stability to Vietnam and strengthening govt. Although badly undermined and discredited by recent events and his own blunders, continuing strength <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s position lies in fact that while National Assembly and constitution are still lacking he represents only legal authority, however tenuous, able to effect peaceful and legal change of governments. Much as we may dislike situation, until National Assembly is elected <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> is <pb xml:id="pg_365" n="365" facs="0395"/>only person competent to provide element political continuity. We must, therefore, give consideration to means preserve <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s position. He can be positive asset should he give full support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> govt pending general elections and establishment National Assembly.</p>
<p>6. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s position.</p>
<p>A. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s position has clearly been strengthened by recent events. Factors in giving him prestige and in increasing his strength have been:</p>
<list>
<item>(1) <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s vigorous and forceful reaction to Binh Xuyen challenge April 28;</item>
<item>(2) Continued loyalty National Army to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> as legal chief of Govt;</item>
<item>(3) Success of National Army in driving unpopular Binh Xuyen from city;</item>
<item>(4) Obvious bitterness of French against <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> which reacted in <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s favor among population;</item>
<item>(5) Ineptness <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s moves against <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s success in resisting them;</item>
<item>(6) Continued US support.</item>
</list>
<p>B. Weaknesses of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s present position are:</p>
<list>
<item>(1) Danger that he may fall captive to Revolutionary Committee.</item>
<item>(2) Fact that loyalty of army, in large measure, is conditioned upon his continuing as legal head of legal Govt.</item>
<item>(3) Possibility that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> could precipitate internal conflict by dismissing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should Revolutionary Committee and Estates General depose <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> associate himself with this action.</item>
<item>(4) Difficulty controlling always latent republican sentiment now that Revolutionary Committee has raised prospect of possible deposition <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>.</item>
<item>(5) Fact that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> himself is vulnerable to being overthrown within brief period should extreme elements depose <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and later turn on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</item>
</list>
<p>7. French position.</p>
<p>A. French position be determined by two factors:</p>
<list>
<item>(1) <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s responsibility for safety <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> and for French lives and property; and as signatory of Geneva accords;</item>
<item>(2) French desire retain cultural and economic presence and to retain Vietnam as part French Union.</item>
</list>
<p>B. Friction between French and Vietnamese has reached serious proportions. It springs from two major sources:</p>
<list>
<item>(1) <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>, to meet his responsibility for the safety of French lives and property, has established a French controlled security zone which includes large portion residential and business zone of Saigon proper. He has introduced new French battalions to protect this zone. Presence these forces, reported refusals to permit <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> units to move through French Zone, and sanctuary provided to three Binh Xuyen <pb xml:id="pg_366" n="366" facs="0396"/>posts located within security zone are constant irritants to Vietnamese nationalists.</item>
<item>(2) Anti-<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> propaganda such as broadcast by Radio France-Asie and allegations of French support of sects, particularly Binh Xuyen, which widely credited by Vietnamese, have added oil to fire.</item>
</list>
<p>C. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and French authorities here have finally concluded <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> must go. Increasing French bitterness toward <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and their sensitivity to “anti-colonialist” propaganda has to some extent been extended to US whom they blame for not joining with them in pressing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to seek cease-fire. French likewise tend blame US for recent bloodshed because we did not agree with them in finding political solution to governmental crisis some three weeks ago.</p>
<p>D. Strong anti-French aspect of Revolutionary Committee has great appeal to large segments of population which beneath surface has long nourished hatred and contempt for French.</p>
<p>E. Quite regardless of future developments, episodes of last week, featured by increasing strain in French-Vietnamese relations, cannot help but severely jeopardize France’s long-range interest in Vietnam. Of late one hears less and less mention of maintenance cultural and economic interests and influence and more and more of threats that France will drop responsibilities and withdraw <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>. We believe this to be passing phase, however.</p>
<p>F. Reference the activities of Revolutionary Committee and States General local French have same fears that we do. French are convinced that Revolutionary Committee is penetrated by Viet Minh agents, but have so far been unable to give us any conclusive proof. They are also skeptical about the States General being able to modify radical resolutions of the Revolutionary Committee.</p>
<p>G. I think it is fair to say that French are convinced that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> desires overthrow <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and will continue efforts to do so irrespective of current activities of Revolutionary Committee.</p>
<p>H. As indicated in recent telegrams, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> and the Commissariat General in Saigon have become so emotional in their bitter opposition to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and his entourage, that I fear they have lost some of their objectivity as to popular reaction to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s recent moves, his hold on the Army, and his ability to deal with the Binh Xuyen. They are quite convinced that serious warfare will be initiated by the Binh Xuyen, and that anti-French sentiment fomented by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and perhaps Viet Minh may still cause serious outbreaks in foreign sections of Saigon.</p>
<p>8. Conclusions.</p>
<p>A. It would appear to me that the essential steps in reconstitution of joint American-French approach to situation in Vietnam should be as follows:</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_367" n="367" facs="0397"/>
<list>
<item>(1) <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government should be fully supported in bringing to a final and quick solution its conflict with the Binh Xuyen.
<list>
<item>(a) This will require on part of French, not only in Paris but more importantly in Saigon, that genuine assistance rather than passive self-obstruction be offered to Vietnamese Government and armed forces.</item>
<item>(b) Specifically, <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> should be directed take active steps to persuade Binh Xuyen to withdraw their forces from three police posts remaining within French security zone in Saigon, or if Binh Xuyen refuse, then to permit Vietnam armed forces to reduce these posts with minimum of casualties.</item>
<item>(c) All echelons of French bureaucracy, including armed forces, should be instructed to desist from agitating against <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government.</item>
<item>(d) Official pressure, both in Paris and Saigon, should be brought upon Radio France-Asie, a semi-governmental institution, to cease its attacks on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government.</item>
<item>(e) Such steps as may be possible should be taken to persuade French pressmen to cease their attacks, particularly in Saigon.</item>
<item>(f) French garrison in Saigon–Cholon should be reduced without delay.</item>
<item>(g) There should be a public announcement by appropriate French authorities of their full support of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government in present conflict with Binh Xuyen.</item>
<item>(h) On the American side, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> should proceed rapidly as possible to assist organization and training of essential logistical services of Vietnamese armed forces so as to make them as independent as possible of <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>. This is under way in accordance with my instructions to <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>.</item>
</list></item>
<item>(2) As soon as current crisis is over, decisive effort must be made to persuade or otherwise force <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to reorganize his government and to establish a cabinet competent to implement broad programs of reform covered by the <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> seven-point program, plus a program for integration of sects into normal life of Vietnam.</item>
<item>(3) If, after reasonable further period of trial, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is unable to constitute a government capable of implementing these programs, US should join with France and <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> in assisting liberal Vietnamese nationalists to establish a competent government.</item>
</list>
<p>B. I recognize that <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> may irrevocably be opposed to supporting any <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government. If this should prove to be true, I would suggest we urge <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> government to replace him, preferably with man of caliber of Devinat,<note n="6" xml:id="d173fn6">Paul Devinat, a Radical Socialist Deputy and former Cabinet minister, had headed a Parliamentary Commission on Indochina in 1953.</note> or perhaps Georges-Picot.<note n="4" xml:id="d173fn4">Possibly <persName corresp="#p_GGAL1">Guillaume</persName> Georges-Picot, French Ambassador to Mexico.</note> At same time, it would probably be necessary to replace <persName corresp="#p_JGPE1">General Jacquot</persName> (who <pb xml:id="pg_368" n="368" facs="0398"/>has incurred violent animosity of Vietnamese during Binh Xuyen affair) with man like General Cogny.<note n="5" xml:id="d173fn5">Général René Cogny, Commander of French Union Land Forces in Northern Vietnam, 1953–1954.</note></p>
<p>C. Reference step (3) above, I recognize also that it may be politically difficult to withdraw US support from <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> even if trial proves is capable of establishing an effective government I still feel that even if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> manages suppress Binh Xuyen, this will not change his own basic incapacity to manage the affairs of government. His present successes may even make it harder for us to persuade <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to take competent men into government, to decentralize authority to his ministers, and to establish sound procedures for the implementation of reform programs. I am still convinced <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> does not have knack of handling men nor the executive capacity truly to unify the country and establish an effective government. If this should become evident, we should either withdraw from Vietnam because our money will be wasted, or we should take such steps as can legitimately be taken to secure an effective new Premier.</p>
<p>D. Throughout all this I feel we must keep our eyes clearly on our main objective in Vietnam, i.e., to assist in saving this country from Communism. No matter who heads the government here, free Vietnam will not be saved unless sound political, economic and military programs are promptly and effectively put into action. This will require wholehearted agreement and coordination between Vietnamese, Americans and French. Difficult as this may be to achieve, it is possible, in my judgment. If this tripartite approach is not secure, we should withdraw from Vietnam.</p>

<p>4907. Eyes only for <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> from Secretary. I am somewhat disturbed lest our position become too rigid on fundamental political questions regarding the future of Vietnam. The ultimate form and organization of the state and the government must be left to the Vietnamese to decide in an orderly manner. These are matters of high state policy which need to be concerted between us before we give <pb xml:id="pg_369" n="369" facs="0399"/>committal. It strikes me this is not the time to declare for or against any particular form of the state.</p>
<p>During the past week Congressional leaders in both houses have expressed more and more frequently their support for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and their opposition to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. The latter is truly unpopular in the US. US Congressional and public opinion would care little and probably much approve if he were removed from the scene.</p>
<p>Of course we would like preserve basis of legitimacy of the government by some orderly process rather than by revolutionary action. But even here we must keep flexibility and not become publicly committed. We are primarily concerned with whether government effectively controls country and has genuine anti-Communist and nationalist support.</p>
<p>If <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and the free nationalist groups apparently now rallied together can stay united, maintain the undivided loyalty of the army, and gain genuine backing of the people in the country, US support can continue to be forthcoming.</p>
<p>I repeat, an important aspect of our policy must be flexibility and adjustment so that we can move according to evolution of the situation.</p>

<head>175. Editorial Note</head>
<p>According to the memorandum of discussion at the 247th meeting of the National Security Council on May 5, the Council listened to the usual briefing by <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> on “Significant World Developments Affecting U.S. Security”. The following excerpt from the briefing concerned Vietnam:</p>
<list>
<item>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> continued his briefing with comments on the situation in South Vietnam. The Binh Xuyen had largely been driven from Saigon and were unlikely to be able to go underground there for the simple reason that the ground was nothing but mud. The real problem which now looms in this country was how to control what appeared to be a genuine revolutionary movement. At least three groups or committees were now operating on the scene. The first was the small so-called revolutionary committee, consisting of about a dozen members. Beyond that was the so-called States General, numbering perhaps 1000 individuals. Finally, there was a rabble numbering about 4000 who were noisily calling for the deposition of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> predicted that it would be difficult for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to control these groups.</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_370" n="370" facs="0400"/>
<item>“The Vice President inquired of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> whether these groups were all nationalist in character. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> replied that we couldn’t be sure that there wasn’t Communist influence behind some of them. While the French claimed that the small revolutionary committee had two Communist members, the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> was inclined to doubt the validity of this claim. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> was searching for an intermediate solution to the problem of legitimate authority. He was trying to constitute a kind of regency committee which would include <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> himself. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> feared, however, that the situation had gotten beyond such a solution. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had been having a number of talks with <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Collins</persName>, who had been urging him to go slow as far as <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> was concerned.</item>
<item>“The President inquired whether <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had moved to take in <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Quat</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Do</persName> and the other cabinet ministers who had previously resigned. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> replied that he had not, because he believed that by resigning, these individuals had demonstrated their unfitness for office. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> furthermore expressed doubt that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would actually organize a strong coalition cabinet. On the other hand, it was undeniable that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was showing great strength both in Saigon and elsewhere throughout the country. He had become the symbol of the break away from the French. This fact alone made it very difficult for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to compromise with regard to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>.” (<persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Library, Whitman File, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Records)</item>

<list type="subject">
<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Talk with President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, afternoon 8 May</item>
</list>
<p>1. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> asked to see me today. Saw him briefly just after noon. He told me the following.</p>
<p>2. He intended sending a letter to the French later today, stating that General <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName> was no longer desired in the Vietnamese Army and asking that he be accepted back into the French Army. He intended taking legal action against General <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Vy</persName> for rebellion.</p>
<p>3. In accordance with your request, he had moderated the demands of the Congress. Most delegates have returned home already. However, he was worried by press dispatches from Paris (which he had on the table in front of him; they were sent from Paris 2130 hrs <pb xml:id="pg_371" n="371" facs="0401"/>7 May and quoted <hi rend="italic">Figaro</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Paris Press</hi>). The gist of the dispatches were [<hi rend="italic">was</hi>] that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> plans to appoint a High Council (<hi rend="italic">Figaro</hi> said “Presidium”) of five worthy persons: <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, two from Imperial Family, <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai Pope</persName>,<note n="2" xml:id="d176fn2"><persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Pham Cong Tac</persName>.</note> and the leader of the Hoa Hao. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> would also appoint a Consultative Council which could be given the task of legislative work. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> would like to be a constitutional monarch, Western style. These plans would have the backing of the British, as indicated by <persName corresp="#p_MDM1">Malcolm MacDonald</persName>. These actions are intended to appease the U.S., save face for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, solve the religious quarrel between the Catholics and the sects, prevent the Revolutionary Committee from proclaiming a republic and thus embarrassing the U.S., bring back calm, initiate reforms.</p>
<p>4. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said that you cannot fight the Vietminh with compromises, with people and ideas despised by the people. He is making a radio address later today, a moderate one, but thinks he will add in his ideas of an election for an Assembly to have a truly representative government. If <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and the French force him to do so, he will go further and reconvene the Congress and let them sound off their real feelings about <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. He said they are a bit resentful at being made to moderate their resolutions.</p>
<p>5. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has appointed Lin Quang Vien (unknown to me) as <gloss target="#t_CO1">CO</gloss>. of the Imperial Guard vice Col. Tuyen. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> sent him a wire saying Tuyen should remain as commander of both Imperial and personal Guard. (<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said latter post was as procurer <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> mistresses). <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> sent cable to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> saying Tuyen had helped <persName corresp="#p_NVV1">Vy</persName> with the coup attempt and was very unpopular in the Guard.</p>

Following is summary conversations on Indochina held with British and French this afternoon.<note n="2" xml:id="d177fn2">According to the diary of the Secretary’s trip, this meeting took place at 6:30 p.m., May 7. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> Conference Files: Lot 60 D 627, CF 445)</note> French Delegation headed by Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName>, British by <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> and US by Secretary. During first part of conversations British were absent, joining later as noted.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> opened conversations by referring to ratification Paris Agreements<note n="3" xml:id="d177fn3">Apparently the reference is to the Nine- and Four-Power Agreements, signed October 23, 1954; for texts, see <ref target="frus1952-54v05p2"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, vol. V Part 2</ref>, pp. 1435 ff.</note> and difficulties French Govt had encountered in process. He observed that public opinion must now be satisfied with early four-power talks. He agreed that we would now be talking from strength and that prospects for success were thereby increased. He referred to China and to fact that France was now ignoring govt which had in hands fate of hundreds of millions of people because of her recognition of fact that US views must be taken into account. He remarked there are now two areas of particular interest to France. They are North Africa and Vietnam. He would call upon Laforest, Minister of Associated States, to give outline French position on latter.</p>
<p>Secretary replied by stating that US recognized courageous step France had taken in ratifying Paris Agreements. Both he and President appreciated magnitude of political task. They felt step, however, was in France’s own interest as well. Secretary expressed opinion that in ratifying France had reaffirmed her position as “one of great nations of world”.</p>
<p>Laforest then opened Indochina discussion. He stated that Geneva Accords had posed several questions including that of how to deal with forthcoming elections. Division of country had given South Vietnam disadvantage in competing with north but what south lacked in area and population was counterbalanced by her economic superiority. France believed that south could win over north in lections if she could present more attractive regime to people. This could be done only with nationalist, stable and broadly based govt. Time was of essence for discussions prior to elections which would <pb xml:id="pg_373" n="373" facs="0403"/>open next July and elections themselves in July 1956. There was no ambiguity in French policy between North and South Vietnam. Presence of France in north could not be erased by stroke of pen. It is French duty to protect her cultural and economic presence there. <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> mission is designed for only that purpose. France had given up thoughts of mixed companies as result our objections and had now surrendered coal mines. <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> mission would be maintained on its present terms. It would be neither enlarged nor changed.</p>
<p>Laforest continued to say that France had loyally supported govt of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> from beginning. Any allegation to contrary is untrue. French constantly tried to reenforce <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Govt. France reached agreement with US last December to persuade “or compel” <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to enlarge Govt. It was agreed to give him until January at which time, if he had failed, we would look into matter of alternate discreetly. This was not done. Last March present govt broke into open conflict with sects. United Front of sects was formed against <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. Both December agreement and common sense told US at that time that something [had] to be done to avoid civil war. France warned that armed conflict—first civil war, then guerrilla warfare, then terrorism—would result if we failed to take action. France has always desired peaceful solution. For this reason joint <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> approach was tried. It was hoped they would arrive at joint plan for solution. Washington appeared first to welcome this concept then changed its mind. <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> left Saigon when civil war was about to break out. Untenable truces were declared. When they were about to expire <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> submitted his own plan on April 19 in order to try to reconcile US and French failure to act. US failed to reply to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. In absence of <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> from Saigon <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> acted.</p>
<p>Laforest continued to say that new Revolutionary Committee appeared to have control. Committee is strongly under Viet Minh influence. A man named [name deleted], staff officer in Vietnamese Army, educated in China was vice-president of Revolutionary Committee. [Name deleted] was one of vice-presidents of Viet Minh Govt. [Name deleted] is notorious Viet Minh agent. Viet Minh influence of “revolutionary” groups is recognizable throughout and their influence is spreading to country. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s deposition is demanded. There is violent campaign against French and French Expeditionary Corps. Viet Minh agents make good use of it and certain Americans do not seem sufficiently aware of this. French Govt does not wish to have its army act as platform for Viet Minh propaganda. Army will not be maintained in Vietnam at any cost. Laforest closed by referring to govt censorship and showed copy of Saigon newspaper, half of which had been censored, as example of extent of govt censorship.</p>
<p>Secretary replied referring to seriousness of situation and necessity that French and US as good friends work closely together. It <pb xml:id="pg_374" n="374" facs="0404"/>would not be profitable to go into detailed charges made against each other in two countries. Question is what to do in face of present situation. He summarized present situation as follows:</p>
<list>
<item>(1) There is a revolutionary movement under way in Vietnam,</item>
<item>(2) We believe that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has the best chance of anyone of staying on top of revolution and keeping it within “tolerable” limits. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is only means US sees to save South Vietnam and counteract revolution. US sees no one else who can. Whatever US view has been in past, today US must support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> wholeheartedly. US must not permit <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to become another Kerensky.</item>
</list>
<p>Regarding <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, Secretary said in his view he had irretrievably lost capacity to be anything but titular head of government if even that position could be saved for him and that this was solution Secretary preferred until election (of National Assembly). <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> should support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and not take away his power. <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> and Hoa Hao could be used but not Binh Xuyen. Secretary expressed opinion that with support two governments, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could sit on top of revolution. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is only force of moderation. <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> a certain stabilizing influence. US was giving funds to support Vietnamese Army and could not see anyone else to give funds to but <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> for that purpose. Concluded by stating that support of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was only way he could see to deal with common problem pointing out that time was running against us and no successful results could be achieved unless two countries worked together.</p>
<p>Meeting was then joined by British for whom Secretary résuméd US position as summarized above adding that in US view present revolution is not yet dominated or influenced by Communists to any appreciable degree. He remarked that prior association with Communists was not in itself sufficient reason to believe that man was a Communist now, citing that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> himself could be considered a Communist on this reasoning. Support of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> did not indicate US non-recognition of his weaknesses. US had not taken part in his original selection and had been and remained ready to support any other man who might be presented by orderly process of law. He remarked that just before outbreak of fighting US was prepared to consider alternatives but he was not sure now that it would have been practical. Secretary remarked he was told last March by <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> that we had already reached point of no return on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d177fn4">See <ref target="#d84">Document 84</ref>.</note> There was no practical way of getting rid of him. Secretary wished to do everything to get <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to enlarge government. It might be possible to change government at the time of forthcoming elections but question remains “who is better than <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>”. If there is a better man US is ready to consider him but re-submits no one has been suggested. Although <pb xml:id="pg_375" n="375" facs="0405"/><persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> had reached agreement with <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> in early April to change <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> he now believes we must support him.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> replied that he thought it best that he speak himself. He wished to state that France is not in agreement with US views. In the past we have concealed this fact from each other but now it is time to speak frankly. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is not a good solution. Joint efforts to prove he is have resulted in failure. France is convinced that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is leading to catastrophe. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> took advantage of <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ absence to effect a “coup de force” which won primary victory but which has not contributed to any lasting solution. His anti-French sentiments are extreme. France does not object to his being anti-French if he is capable but being anti-French is not a sufficient quality in itself. France will not continue with him for, one way or another, he will bring on a Viet Minh victory. He is surrounded by Vietnam elements and there is no time to lose. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is not only incapable but mad (fou). He ruined our chances for a possible solution just when it was in the offing. France can no longer take risks with him. He could yield to the revolutionary groups. Continuing with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would have three disastrous results:</p>
<list>
<item>(1) It would bring on a Viet Minh victory,</item>
<item>(2) It would focus the hostility of everyone on French, and</item>
<item>(3) It will bring on a Franco-US breach. Everyone believes that the US is backing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and encouraging him in his anti-French sentiments even if the French Government knows US is not.</item>
</list>
<p><persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> continued that much of Franco-US difficulty grows out of fact that we have never admitted our true thoughts from beginning. Last September we might have had an agreed solution if we had expressed our doubts but we did not. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> is a “bad card” but by means of him something is possible but with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> failure is certain. We might have been able to save situation on eve of coup de force if we had had three-sided agreement (US, France, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>) but again we failed. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> has faults but he can serve a useful purpose and should be used for that. He cannot be excluded as a possibility for bringing about a more productive solution but as long as <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is there the view is obstructed and no solution is possible. To résumé, <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> said, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is impossible and there is no chance for him to succeed or to improve the situation. Another man might not be able to improve the situation either and, in fact, there is no one specifically in mind but at least with another man there is a chance but with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> there is none.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> then concluded with the following significant statement: “<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is a bad choice, impossible solution, with no chance to succeed and no chance to improve the situation. Without him some solution might be possible, but with him there is none. However, I <pb xml:id="pg_376" n="376" facs="0406"/>cannot guarantee any other solution would work nor is it possible to clarify the situation. There seems to be fundamental disagreement between us. I could have claimed that since French position is predominant in Vietnam, you should accommodate your views more to ours, but I have rejected this. What should be done under the circumstances? What would you say if we were to retire entirely from Indochina and call back the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> as soon as possible. I fully realize this would be a grave solution, as it would leave French civilians and French interests in a difficult position. There is also the question of the refugees’ fate. If you think this might be a possible solution, I think I might be able to orient myself towards it if you say so. It would have advantage of avoiding all further reproach to France of ‘colonialism’ while at the same time giving response to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s request that France should go. Since it contemplates the liquidation of the situation and the repatriation of the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>, would the United States be disposed to help protect French civilians and the refugees? If you do not agree to this solution and believe it would hamper you, then we can have further discussions on the Vietnamese situation.”</p>
<p>Secretary replied that he appreciated frankness. It is only way friends should speak to each other. There is a fundamental difference between France and US. US has higher regard of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s capabilities than France. US informed “coup de force” was engineered by Binh Xuyen while French say otherwise. Secretary himself had had doubts that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could survive. It was questionable whether army was loyal to him and he did not control the National Police. Loyalty of French Govt itself in support of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was not questioned but there were difficulties from other sources such as Radio Francaise-Asie. US does not agree with French opinion of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. If he had been a non-entity he would have collapsed but he did not. He showed so much ability that US fails to see how he can be got rid of now. It is assumed that France would not wish to do so by force.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is stronger now than when <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> first withdrew his powers. Worst aspect is that problem involves difference of opinion between France and US. Vietnam is not worth quarrel with France. Common interests are too great to be jeopardized by difference of opinion on Vietnam. Secretary agreed with French statement that it must not affect Franco-US relations in other areas. If it would solve problem, US would withdraw and drop its support of Vietnam. Franco-US differences must be resolved now for Secretary did not believe that US Congress would continue with its present aid program otherwise. Substantial sums of 4 to 5 hundred million dollars are involved.</p>
<p>Choice open to US is to have <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> supported or to withdraw. It is grave problem which the Secretary would like to think about overnight. French suggestions are serious and must be weighed carefully. <pb xml:id="pg_377" n="377" facs="0407"/>Advice and counsel are needed. US interest in Vietnam is simply to withhold area from Communists. US will give consideration to any suggestion French make but must warn that US financial support may not be expected to any solution which Secretary can think of as alternative to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.<note n="5" xml:id="d177fn5"><p>In <gloss target="#t_Dulte1">Dulte</gloss> 2, May 7, 11 p.m., <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> reported to the President on the day’s events. Included in the cable was the following excerpt on this first tripartite discussion on Vietnam:</p>
<p>“Then we met alone with the French, being joined after a time by the British for discussion of Indochina. Here <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> proposed that in view of the sharp differences of opinion which existed between our two governments with reference to policy in Vietnam and in view of his government’s total inability to support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, who had now become violently anti-French, he proposed that the French should withdraw their forces from Vietnam. He raised the question as to whether in this event we would be able to give my assurances regarding protection of lives and property of remaining nationals.</p>
<p>“I replied that this was too serious a matter to settle without deliberation, and that I agreed that Vietnam was not worth a quarrel between France and the US. If we could not agree, then one or the other should withdraw from the scene, as we could not afford to oppose each other in this area and adopt rival and competitive policies. I said that the US would be willing to withdraw, and indeed I could not have any good hope that Congress would appropriate the necessary funds for US to support the situation if we withdrew support from <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and sought an alternative which <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> himself said he could not now define. My guess is that the French are not bluffing and that his proposal may be the agreed solution.” (Department of State, Central Files, 396.1/5–755)</p>
<p>According to <gloss target="#t_Tedul1">Tedul</gloss> 2 to Paris, May 8, <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s “only comment on Vietnam section of <gloss target="#t_Dulte1">Dulte</gloss> 2 was to reiterate position that U.S. could not afford to have forces committed in such undesirable areas as Vietnam.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/5–855)</p>
<p>In a later report to the President, <gloss target="#t_Dulte1">Dulte</gloss> 12, May 9, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> described inter alia to <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> a discussion with <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> which went as follows:</p>
<p>“<persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> also told me privately that he did not think that <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> meant what he said when he proposed to withdraw the French troops. <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> implied that <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> was bluffing because, <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> said, it would be ‘unthinkable’ to abandon southern Viet Nam to the Communists. This is another matter where <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> differ sharply, but Indo-China is not under the jurisdiction of the Foreign Minister, but under the Minister for Colonies, and <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> is in fact running that and alone dealing with Indo-China to the exclusion of <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName>.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid,</hi> 396.1/5–955)</p>
</note> Question must be taken up again tomorrow.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> stated that British interests in Vietnam were more indirect but nonetheless vital because (1) interest in area itself and (2) interest in Communist threat from any area in world. It would be grave error to reach decision that evening. Foreign Ministers are to be in Paris several days and should look into matter again. Events might overtake our decisions. Accurate review of what has been said should be undertaken and effort to ascertain facts should be made by all sides. It is important that nothing be released of what had been discussed during meeting as leak would be calamitous. Believe efforts should be made by all to think seriously of what has been said and keep contents absolutely secret.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_378" n="378" facs="0408"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> agreed with <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, stating that he had never expected decision that evening. Experts should get down to work immediately and prepare for decisions as events are changing hourly.</p>
<p>Meeting closed with general discussion concerning schedule for further talks on Indochina and forthcoming visit of Foreign Ministers to Vienna.</p>
<p>A discussion ensued concerning text of communiqué.<note n="6" xml:id="d177fn6">No text of a joint communiqué has been found.

<p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 11. (1) Following yesterday’s tri-partite meeting<note n="2" xml:id="d178fn2">Reference is to the meeting described in <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 8, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> we emphasized to Berard and <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ estimate of situation as given in Saigon’s 5074 to Department<note n="3" xml:id="d178fn3"><ref target="#d173">Document 173</ref>.</note> including particularly his conclusion that unless wholehearted agreement and coordination between Viet Namese, Americans and French were secured, we should withdraw from Viet Nam. They commented that there seemed to be one basic divergence between U.S. and French estimate of situation. U.S. believed that events of past week had strengthened <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>; French information was that he was in weaker position than ever.</p>
<p>(2) This morning <persName corresp="#p_ATC1">Achilles</persName> met with Berard at latter’s request, Dennis Allen of British Foreign Office and Riley of British Embassy present. Berard read parts of <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>’s latest telegram of which principal points were as follows:</p>
<list>
<item><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s apparent success rests in fact on present disorderly and chaotic conditions. Army had not been able to follow up its success in Saigon by further operations to destroy <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> [<hi rend="italic">Binh</hi>] Xuyen. Sect problem was unsolved with each in control in its own area and army unable to suppress them there. Present disorderly conditions provided <pb xml:id="pg_379" n="379" facs="0409"/>fertile field for Communist efforts. At yesterday’s meeting of Revolutionary Congress Son<note n="4" xml:id="d178fn4">Hom Pan Son, Vice President of the Committee.</note> had declared <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> only person really working for Viet Nam. <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> concluded that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could be saved if at all only by support of French, U.S. and <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>, sects, army and <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>.</item>
</list>
<p>(3) Berard also read from what he described as summary of available French intelligence. High points were:</p>
<list>
<item><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s use of force against sects had brought about conditions which facilitated Communist infiltration and Communists were now making most of it through Revolutionary Committee. Typical Communist tactics were in evidence. Information previously given concerning Communist background or connections of <persName corresp="#p_SNT1">Son</persName>, Lang and Kon repeated. New themes being used by propaganda apparatus in South Viet Nam stressing peace, overthrow of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and removal of <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> were typical Communist themes and similar to those which had been used for some time in North Viet Nam.</item>
</list>
<p>(4) Berard described French position as follows:</p>
<list>
<item>They were convinced <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> weaker rather than stronger as result of struggle against sects and current chaos. Anti-French sentiment was growing under <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s encouragement. As anti-French feeling was his only asset, it was naturally hard for French Government to support him. French questioned whether loyalty of army could be counted upon to serve under <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_TVD2">Don</persName>. It had supported <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> because he represented legal government. If <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> broke with <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, army would be faced with choice between loyalty to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and going along with Revolutionary Committee. French thought it might still be possible to develop broadly based government and, while prospect of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> heading it caused French doubts and difficulties, they could still envisage it. They continued to wish to utilize <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> not as individual but as sole available source of legality for governmental changes and thereby as stabilizing influence.</item>
</list>
<p>(5) <persName corresp="#p_ATC1">Achilles</persName> cited four possible alternatives:</p>
<list>
<item>a. French withdrawal as suggested by <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> and of which President had been advised.</item>
<item>b. U.S. withdrawal which <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> envisaged if new solution having wholehearted support of all concerned could not be obtained.</item>
<item>c. Withdrawal of both French and U.S. efforts.</item>
<item>d. Reorganized and broadly based government including <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> provided wholehearted French and Viet Namese support could be obtained. He emphasized that such arrangement would require much more wholehearted French support at all levels than in past since French, without acting in bad faith, had nevertheless permitted their doubts as to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s ability to succeed to color their thinking for a long time. Berard remarked that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had been initially chosen by French because they thought he had best chance to succeed, that cooling of their support in recent months had been due to their growing belief he could not succeed, and that French support could <pb xml:id="pg_380" n="380" facs="0410"/>be counted upon if new arrangement could be reached which they felt showed reasonable chance of success.</item>

<p>(6) British took no part other than to indicate general interest and desire to be kept informed.</p>
<p>(7) We are arranging further bilateral ministerial meeting Tuesday,<note n="5" xml:id="d178fn5">May 10; see <ref target="#d184">Document 184</ref>.</note> perhaps with British observer present, and probably further tripartite meeting Wednesday.<note n="6" xml:id="d178fn6">See <ref target="#d186">Document 186</ref>.</note></p>

<p>“Re <gloss target="#t_Dulte1">Dulte</gloss> 2, it would be useful to have the views of Defense and Joint Chiefs on military aspects <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName>’s proposal re Vietnam, if it is possible before our next discussion on this matter Tuesday, May 10, 4 p.m.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 396.1/5–855)</p>
<p>For that part of <gloss target="#t_Dulte1">Dulte</gloss> 2 which deals with Vietnam, see <ref target="#d177fn5">footnote 5, Document 177</ref>.</p></note> following is text of <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> paper submitting their views on Indochina.<note n="3" xml:id="d179fn3">In its original form the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> paper was a memorandum to the Secretary of Defense, May 9. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/5–955) The text is printed in <hi rend="italic">United States–Vietnam Relations, 1945–1967</hi>, Book 10, pp. 971–974.</note> Paper has been concurred in by Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p>“1. The Joint Chiefs of Staff submit herewith their views regarding the military aspects of the problem presented in the attached excerpt from a telegram from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> to the Department of State.</p>
<p>2. The situation as depicted in the telegram from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> appears to present the United States with a choice between:</p>
<list>
<item>a. Continuing to support the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government in Vietnam—which would result in the withdrawal of French forces from that country; or</item>
<item>b. Withdrawing United States support from Vietnam—allowing the French to deal with the situation as they deem fit.</item>
</list>
<p>3. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that the question as to whether the United States should or should not continue to support <pb xml:id="pg_381" n="381" facs="0411"/>the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government, or any other particular Vietnamese regime, is one for resolution at the governmental level. Their comments relative to the alternatives set forth above are, therefore, limited to their military implications.</p>
<p>4. It is considered doubtful that the Vietnam National Army (<gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss>), in its present state of development and unassisted by other forces, can continue to maintain internal security under the conditions of near-civil war now prevailing in Vietnam. There is even less likelihood that the <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> could offer more than a token resistance to external aggression. Further, it is open to question whether the <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> would be loyal to the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government under all circumstances. The presence and cooperation of an outside military force is therefore essential at this time if Vietnamese security and integrity are to be assured. The United States is debarred by the provision of the Geneva Agreement from providing such forces, and could therefore give no assurances regarding the protection of lives and property of French or any other foreign nationals. While the withdrawal of the French Expeditionary Corps is ultimately to be desired, it is considered that a precipitate withdrawal now would be likely to result in an increasingly unstable and precarious situation. This situation would undoubtedly be exploited to Communist advantage, with the probable eventuality that South Vietnam would be lost to communism.</p>
<p>5. In the face of the strong anti-French sentiment which has developed in Vietnam, there now seems little prospect that France alone can provide either the leadership or the resources required to establish a stable Vietnamese government. Without United States moral and material support it cannot be expected that the <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> would develop into a cohesive military force or maintain even its present limited effectiveness. Without effective indigenous forces and without a Vietnam government which can command the loyalty and support of its people, the French Expeditionary Corps (<gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>), judged by past performances, would be incapable of preserving the security and integrity of Vietnam. It can therefore be expected that, following the pattern which led to the loss in the North, South Vietnam would, in due course, fall to the Communists.</p>
<p>6. For the foregoing reasons, the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that neither of the alternatives suggested represent acceptable solutions to the problem of Vietnam at this time. They feel it to be in the best interest of France as well as of the United States that every reasonable effort be exerted to preserve South Vietnam from communism. It is their opinion that the present situation, involving armed resistance against the established governmental authority and the dangers inherent in the role assumed by the Revolutionary Committee, requires the utmost in cooperation and energetic action by the <pb xml:id="pg_382" n="382" facs="0412"/>Vietnamese, United States, and French Governments toward the restoration of internal order and governmental control in Vietnam. It is considered that this should constitute the immediate joint objective. The Joint Chief s of Staff recommend that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> be advised that from the military point of view:</p>
<list>
<item>a. The government of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> shows the greatest promise of achieving the internal stability essential for the future security of Vietnam.</item>
<item>b. The United States could not guarantee the security of the French nationals should the French Expeditionary Corps be withdrawn.</item>
<item>c. Possible United States actions under the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty could ultimately afford security to South Vietnam equal to that provided by the continued presence of the French Expeditionary Corps.</item>
</list>
<p>7. The above comments are submitted without benefit of the specific views of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>, which have been requested by the Secretary of State. They should, therefore, be considered as tentative and subject to possible revision in the light of his reply.”</p>

<p>“Would like your reaction on <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName>’s concluding remarks re <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> contained in our telegraphic summary reference telegram [<gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 8].

Also your evaluation what risks facing French Nationals if <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> withdrawn quickly.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/5–855)</p></note></p>
<p>A. Reference <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName>’s suggestion that <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> might be withdrawn shortly.</p>
<p>1. There are three military reasons why <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> should remain in Vietnam, at least until July 1956:</p>
<list>
<item>a. If <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> should be withdrawn from Vietnam, a strategic military vacuum would be left in this area which could be dangerous. As it stands now, France has accepted major strategic responsibility for the defense of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, under the broad aegis <pb xml:id="pg_383" n="383" facs="0413"/>of the Manila Pact. I doubt if the US, British Commonwealth, or India is prepared to step in now and assume this responsibility.</item>
<item>b. As long as <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> is functioning in Vietnam, I feel there is no danger of Viet Minh launching an attack across 17th parallel. If for any reason <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> should disband, or if about time scheduled for elections under Geneva Accord Viet Minh become convinced that they cannot win such elections or that elections may not be held, there may be danger of Viet Minh attack. Only real safeguard against this latter contingency lies in declaration of Manila Pact powers. It appears quite clear that only military action, if any, that might be taken by Manila Pact powers, would be to employ air and naval action against Viet Minh. I assume the application of this power would not be limited to North Vietnam, but might be extended to China if there were clear indications that Viet Minh attack was being supported by China. However, in addition, in my judgment, there would have to be naval and air action in South Vietnam against the Viet Minh in order to prevent the latter from overrunning all of South Vietnam. Such overrunning could not be prevented by naval and air action alone, as was clearly demonstrated in Korea. It would be necessary to have some land forces which could fight delaying actions from 17th parallel to defensive positions covering the vital Saigon–Cap St Jacques area and to conduct defense latter area. Vietnamese army alone could not provide effective forces for this purpose. Aside from the technical skill required to conduct delaying actions, a force trained in coordinating and directing the application of air power in connection with ground operations would be essential. The <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> alone is competent to perform such operations and such coordination.</item>
<item>c. Second military reason for desiring retention of <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> is that under the Geneva Accord limiting the introduction of additional foreign military personnel, the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> is an essential element in reorganizing and training Vietnamese armed forces. <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> will furnish bulk of instructors and, for some time to come, many of the technical advisers. In addition, the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> still provides almost complete logistical support for Vietnamese forces. <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> could possibly leave behind only the essential supply and depot troops necessary to handle supply installations until Vietnamese army is ready to take them over. Similarly, a French training mission could be retained under our Chief of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss></item>
</list>
<p>2. In addition to the strictly military questions involved in retaining <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> in Vietnam, there are also closely related political questions. I recognize that presence <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>, in recent weeks particularly, has lent itself to propaganda that “colonialists” were using this military force to resist the will of the “people” to liquidate Binh Xuyen, repudiate <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, consolidate <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> regime and constitute popular assembly. Whatever elements of validity there may be in this criticism, I believe we must not lose sight of fact that <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> may have prevented more dangerous elements, with or without Viet Minh complicity, from overwhelming <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and paving way for eventual Viet Minh takeover. Whether or not <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> should be retained on purely political grounds can be reasonably debated on affirmative and negative sides. <pb xml:id="pg_384" n="384" facs="0414"/>On balance, however, is clear that presence of <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> exerts desirable moderating influence.</p>
<p>B. Reference Secretary’s question regarding risks faced by French nationals if <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> were quickly withdrawn.</p>
<p>1. If <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> were withdrawn precipitately under present conditions, that act would set official seal on basic break between French and Vietnam. Consequences which would follow would depend on manner in which <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> were withdrawn:</p>
<list>
<item>a. The <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> might be withdrawn in a calm and measured manner, with the minimum of friction and ill-feeling and With some French expression of confidence in security of the situation they were leaving, or</item>
<item>b. Withdrawal might be made in petulant and aggravating manner which would create great deal of ill-feeling and sense of insecurity.</item>
</list>
<p>2. a. Under conditions 1a. above, there would probably be no great danger to French or other foreign community although isolated incidents might occur. Certain evacuations of French women and children have already taken place without event.</p>
<p>b. If condition 1b. develops, as might be the case in present French mood, there could be serious disturbances which might lead to panic, particularly if the withdrawal were precipitate. The present violent anti-French campaign being waged by certain elements in Vietnam would be inflamed by French action and could lead to serious outbreaks. Viet Minh could be counted on to stimulate such troubles.</p>
<p>3. An important element to consider would be effect of <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> withdrawal on economic situation in Vietnam. French business interests play a most important part in Vietnamese economy.</p>
<list>
<item>a. If <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> withdrawal were under condition 1a. above, we believe there would be no major exodus of French business firms and that those which wished to remain could do so and successfully conduct their business.</item>
<item>b. If, however, withdrawal should be under condition 1b., wholesale evacuation of French commercial and business interests might well follow. This could create such conditions of economic chaos that the entire US effort in Vietnam, both military and economic, would be brought to standstill. This is because the commercial community, largely in French hands, generates the piasters which pay for these programs.</item>
</list>
<p>4. We believe it unlikely French would actually carry out a total voluntary evacuation of the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>. French business interests are unable under present conditions to withdraw their sizeable remaining elements. We think it probable that they would be able apply sufficient political <pb xml:id="pg_385" n="385" facs="0415"/>pressure on French Govt to ensure continued presence of at least minimum military protection.</p>

<p>1. Believe Saigon in best position comment on risk to French Nationals if <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> withdrawn quickly. However, from Washington viewpoint we note following basic factors of problem: a) Seems doubtful <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> could be completely evacuated in less than several months at earliest, b) Presume Government Viet-Nam, if majority <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> withdrawn at French volition rather than ostensibly at demand of Vietnamese, might be able agree smaller <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> retain functions such as patrolling demarcation line, occupation Tourane and perhaps other bases and participation with U.S. in training of National Army. However we recognize this might not be politically acceptable to France. If on other hand, <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> appeared be expelled as result nationalist sentiments, then presumably exceedingly difficult for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> or moderate elements to accept continuation limited <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> presence outlined above. Paradoxically, French initiative in offering withdraw <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> might result in Vietnamese request of continuation some elements, whereas if initiative seized by Vietnamese in demanding withdrawal under terms of Geneva Accord, likely such withdrawal would have to be complete, c) In general reduction or withdrawal <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> would have politically desirable effects local situation Viet-Nam, since it would remove last vestige colonial issue.</p>
<p>2. Regarding <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName>’s comments, we note he refers to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>‘s request that French should go. We unable identify any such request by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> although aware Revolutionary Committee first resolution which appears to have been dropped.<note n="3" xml:id="d181fn3">According to telegram 4987 from Saigon, May 1, the General Assembly of Democratic Revolutionary Forces—as opposed to the Revolutionary Committee—Circulated three resolutions. In the first the Assembly charged the French with instigating the Binh Xuyen “rebellion” and called for withdrawal of the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>.

<p>3. Department’s comments on <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName>’s question as to U.S. response if French were to retire entirely from Indochina and call back the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> as soon as possible as follows: If French withdrew <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>, U.S. can obviously not assume responsibility for protection French nationals and property. French Government must have foreseen such eventuality when they agreed at Geneva withdraw <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> at unilateral request Viet-Nam Government.</p>
<p>4. Washington view is that French not bluffing and may very well take this opportunity to withdraw <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>.</p>
<p>5. In general we believe a) France may well withdraw major elements <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> at own volition, or that in any case; b) Vietnamese sooner or later will request withdrawal <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>; c) Withdrawal or reduction of <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> is not without positive political value in Viet-Nam and possibly to France although we recognize such might diminish whatever deterrent value <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> presence against Communist aggression constitutes; d) We believe from political viewpoint preferable to France and Free World if French should negotiate with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> regarding at least limited withdrawal, which might result in retention limited <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> functions noted paragraph 1b. above rather than complete withdrawal at Vietnamese request.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Polto1">Polto</gloss> 28. For <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>. This morning <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> and Gibson met with Laforest, Berard and Risterucci at French request. Friendly but forthright discussion laid out frankly differing attitudes of French and Americans on various aspects Vietnamese crisis, except, of course, basic desire work together if possible for common objective of preventing Communist take-over.</p>
<p>Much of meeting spent by French in complaining about specific unfavorable U.S. press articles and in alleging U.S. subordinate officials <pb xml:id="pg_387" n="387" facs="0417"/>in Saigon can be proved to have aided and abetted <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>‘s attack on Binh Xuyen and government’s anti-French propaganda campaign. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> refuted these charges and enumerated some complaints about French behavior. Both agreed mutual recriminations would not be helpful and turned to immediate problems.</p>
<p>Following seemed to be main points of Laforest’s exposition:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) If U.S. insists on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, primary requirement is to reinforce <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government and make it really government of national union according to one of principles of original <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> seven-point program. French Government remains prepared to carry out its terms.</item>
<item>(b) French Government had tried to support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, but present hostility to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> grows out of increasingly violent press attacks against the French. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> himself has provoked this hostile attitude in France.</item>
<item>(<hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> While claiming <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> himself is using anti-French themes to build up his own strength, French officials, when pressed, admitted some of the anti-French activities are probably done without <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s knowledge. French officials seem to be most upset over sound trucks moving around Saigon.)</item>
<item>(c) He took up question of <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> withdrawal by referring to <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName>’s proposition of last Saturday for “progressive reduction of <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>” which would allow <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to say Vietnam is independent. If <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> should leave Indochina it would be in response to requests from various Vietnamese elements surrounding the government. If the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> should leave and the requests of the Vietnamese be met in this respect, would the U.S. give assurances that it would take over responsibility for protecting European lives and property? <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> reminded Laforest of Secretary’s reply in trilateral meeting. Matter dropped.</item>
</list>
<p><persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> informed Laforest of conclusions in Saigon’s 5074,<note n="2" xml:id="d182fn2"><ref target="#d173">Document 173</ref>.</note> paragraph 8(1)(a) to (g), para 8(2), and final paragraph of <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>. Laforest and Risterucci, in particular, reacted against suggestion French should make all-out declaration for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government. They also thought broadening of government should be carried out before other recommendations considered.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> also told Laforest that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had told <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> ammunition and other shortages which French had refused to supply had prevented National Army from pursuing Binh Xuyen. French knew nothing about this and discounted <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s statement entirely.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Status of <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> Seven Point Program.</item>
</list>
<p>1. You are familiar, I believe, with the seven point program which <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> and I developed some months ago, outline of which is contained in <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 2004, November 29, 1954 (see attached).<note n="2" xml:id="d183fn2">Telegram 2004 was not attached to the source text; for text, see <ref target="frus1952-54v13p2"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, vol. XIII, Part 2</ref>, p. 2315.</note> Both <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> and I feel that the implementation of this program is essential if South Vietnam is to be saved from the Viet Minh.</p>
<p>2. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, very little actual progress has been made in converting these programs from paper plans into actual achievements. The primary reason, in my judgment, has been the failure of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to organize an effective cabinet of strong and able men and to decentralize to these men the power to act within their assigned ministries.</p>
<p>3. I would suggest that you continue to use every legitimate pressure that can be brought on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to implement these programs.</p>
<p>4. The current status of the programs is as follows:</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">a. Armed Forces</p>
<p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Reorganization and Reduction of the Armed Forces</hi>.</p>
<list>
<item>(a) The agreed structure of the Vietnamese Armed Forces as officially proposed by Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName>, with the approval of President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, is contained in a letter to me from the Minister of Defense <persName corresp="#p_HTM1">Minh</persName> dated January 19, 1955.<note n="3" xml:id="d183fn3">The text of this letter is in telegram 2876 from Saigon, January 21. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.5–MSP/1–2155)</note></item>
<item>(b) The approved structure will have to be modified somewhat to take care of the integration into the Army of a larger number of <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> and Hoa Hao forces. A study of the necessary changes has just been completed and is contained in outline form in <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 4373, April 6.<note n="4" xml:id="d183fn4">See <ref target="#d105fn2">footnote 2, Document 105</ref>.</note></item>
<item>(c) Because of difficulties with the sects, the rate of reduction of the Army has been considerably slower than originally planned. Furthermore, the internal situation in the country will prevent the early initiation of a revised selective service system. It had been planned to <pb xml:id="pg_389" n="389" facs="0419"/>initiate on September 1, 1955, a system of drafting 10,000 men each four months. These men were to undergo an intensive period of training before being passed into the ranks of the active forces. As each group of 10,000 entered the active ranks, an equivalent number of old soldiers, now paid at a very high rate of pay, were to be discharged. During their period of training, the recruits were to receive pay at the rate of 50 piasters a week. Thereafter, their base pay in the Army was to be 100 piasters a week. It appears now that this system cannot be initiated before January 1, 1956.</item>
<item>(d) In consequence, although current plans call for reducing the total strength as of the end of the year to 100,000, of whom 10,000 were to be inducted recruits drawing the reduced pay, it may be necessary to retain in the active service until December 31, 1955, approximately 110,000 officers and men all paid at the present high rates of pay. These necessary changes, together with plans for demobilizing all sect forces not inducted into the National Army, will require approximately $40 million additional US funds above the figure planned for <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1955. When I was in Washington recently, I initiated arrangements with <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> to secure these additional funds with the tacit approval of the Secretary of State. Formal approval has not yet been received. On 10 May I sent a formal request to Washington for the necessary funds (see <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 5173, May 10, 1955<note n="5" xml:id="d183fn5">Not printed. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/5–1055)</note>).</item></list>
<p>2) <hi rend="italic">Training</hi>.</p>
<list>
<item>As the US component of <gloss target="#t_TRIM1">TRIM</gloss> increases and the US <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> builds its strength toward the 342-man ceiling to which the US has agreed, more US officers are moving out into the field to advise Vietnamese units on the ground. This program is proceeding satisfactorily. There <hi rend="italic">are</hi> US officer-advisers in all three field divisions, with all three regional headquarters, and with the schools and training centers thus far established.</item>
</list>
<p>(3) <hi rend="italic">Autonomy of Armed Forces</hi>.</p>
<list>
<item>It is still contemplated that the French will grant full autonomy to the Armed Forces by 1 July of this year. They will have removed by that date all French officers in command and staff positions, and Vietnamese officers will replace them. French advisers, a part of the <gloss target="#t_TRIM1">TRIM</gloss> organization, will continue to assist in development of the Vietnamese Armed Forces.</item>
</list>
<p>(4) <hi rend="italic">Orientation of the Armed Forces to Support of the Government</hi>.</p>
<list>
<item>When I first arrived in November 1954, the Chief of Staff, General <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName>, was, in effect, in open rebellion against President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, and although no actual fighting of any consequence had taken place, the situation was quite critical. Shortly after I arrived, due to various pressures applied on <persName corresp="#p_NVH1">Hinh</persName> the latter was recalled to France. Since that time, until the recent fighting, the loyalty of the Army was somewhat in doubt. As a matter of fact, the French did not believe that, in the event of fighting against sect forces, the Army would support the Government. The latter prediction, however, did not turn out to be correct, for the Army, up to the present, has given the President its complete and wholehearted support, with but few minor exceptions. By doing so, the Army has supported the legal Government of Vietnam. Where its loyalty will lie in the event that <pb xml:id="pg_390" n="390" facs="0420"/><persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> were to remove <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> from office, is a moot question. However, I believe that the Army would remain loyal to the President of the Council. There might be some tense moments of indecision amongst the leaders of the Army if such eventualities were to arrive, but I believe that the inherent dislike of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and the possibility of the return of a type of French colonalism if he were to regain power, would influence the Army to back the President of the Council.</item>
</list>
<p>(5) <hi rend="italic">Pacification and Rehabilitation</hi>.</p>
<list>
<item>In addition to basic reorganization and training of the Army, our <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> has had an active part in developing plans for pacification of the country and reoccupation of areas formerly occupied by the Viet Minh. The physical reoccupation of former Viet Minh territories will be completed shortly. The Vietnamese National Security Action Program, which is the name of the pacification operation, is being monitored for our Agencies in Vietnam by the National Security Division of <gloss target="#t_TRIM1">TRIM</gloss> under <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Colonel Lansdale</persName>. Although the operation at the Camau Peninsula last March was the first operation of this type conducted by the National Army, it was carried out quite effectively and the recent reoccupation of the Binh Dinh area is proceeding even more successfully. However, although these two actions have been conducted satisfactorily, I would advise you to keep your finger closely on the overall Pacification and Rehabilitation program throughout the entire country. Much needs to be done in the actual reestablishment of controls, both civil and military, over these regions. I would suggest that you have the <gloss target="#t_TRIM1">TRIM</gloss> staff of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> give you a briefing on these plans.</item>
</list>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">b. Resettlement of Refugees and Displaced Persons.</p>
<list>
<item>(1) Generally speaking, the reception and temporary housing of refugees from Tonkin area has progressed satisfactorily. By the time you arrive in Saigon the period set for wholesale evacuations will have been completed. However, a trickle of refugees across the 17th parallel will probably continue for some time to come.</item>
<item>(2) Something over 200,000 of the 650,000 refugees have been settled in areas where the Commissioner of Refugees believes they can reside permanently. The bulk of the others are earning a scanty living in the vicinity of temporary villages where they are now sheltered.</item>
<item>(3) Plans had been laid to settle the bulk of the refugees in the rice-producing areas of Cochin-China. Unfortunately, the action of the “United Front” of the sects and the covert opposition of the sects to the settlement of Northern refugees in the areas under their feudal control, has greatly interfered with this program.</item>
<item>(4) Aside from the opposition of the sects, a larger obstacle has been the failure (until last week) of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to appoint a Minister of Interior, and to press the establishment of sound local governments throughout the newly-freed areas. I had originally urged <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to designate a Vice-President to coordinate the operations of the Ministers of Defense and Interior in the pacification program, but this he refused to do. Unfortunately, in the new Government, he has personally retained the Ministry of Defense which will continue to make it difficult to obtain this essential coordination. Perhaps you <pb xml:id="pg_391" n="391" facs="0421"/>can persuade him to give some real authority to Mr. Cung, in the personal entourage of the President, the man who is <hi rend="italic">supposed</hi> to be exercising this coordination.</item>
<item>(5) The appointment in the new Cabinet of [name and title deleted], is a hopeful sign. I have already instructed <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Colonel Lansdale</persName>, who has been acting as my coordinator under <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, for the implementation of the pacification program, to brief [name deleted], in the presence of [name and title deleted] and Mr. Cung on the details of the program and point out things that need to be done. This must be followed up also by representatives of the other Chiefs of US agencies involved in the pacification program.</item>
</list>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">c. The Agrarian Reform Program.</p>
<list>
<item>(1) Closely related with the problem of the resettlement of refugees is the agrarian reform program on which I would suggest you have a briefing by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Barrows</persName> and his Assistants.</item>
<item>(2) This program has been interfered with by the actions of sects, and the lack of action on the part of appropriate Vietnamese governmental agencies.</item>
<item>(3) I regard this program as one of the key elements in the cold war fight against the Viet Minh. If the sects accept the broad program we have developed for their integration into the normal life of Vietnam, this agrarian reform program can be made to go forward. Much still needs to be done. I highly recommend that you read Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW1">Ladejinsky</persName>’s excellent report on this subject.<note n="6" xml:id="d183fn6">Apparently <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> is referring to <persName corresp="#p_LW1">Wolf I. Ladejinsky</persName>’s “Field Trip Observations in Central Vietnam”, April 2, and/or his “Field Trip in South Vietnam”, undated, both of which are <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Files: Lot 62 D 1, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5519.</note></item>
</list>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">d. Formation of a National Assembly.</p>
<list>
<item>(1) One of the essential weaknesses in the governmental structure of Vietnam is the absence of any National Assembly. Without such an Assembly the only legal authority in the Government rests with <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> who has the tenuous power of being able to appoint the President of the Council of Ministers and exercise many other controls.</item>
<item>(2) Unfortunately, the recent revolt of the Binh Xuyen has completely upset plans for a Provisional National Assembly which was to have been elected on the 15th of this month. These plans have been suspended indefinitely.</item>
<item>(3) It is too early to say what will be the outcome of the actions by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, the Revolutionary Committee, and the Estates General. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s present plans appear to call for the election of a National Assembly sometime within the next three to six months. I have instructed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MFEJ1">Meloy</persName>, the Chief of the Political Section, who has been monitoring this program, to keep in touch and establish contact with the appropriate officials of the new Cabinet, and to aid in every way in the development of plans for the election of a National Assembly as promptly as possible.</item>
</list>
<pb xml:id="pg_392" n="392" facs="0422"/>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">e. Financial and Economic.</p>
<list>
<item>(1) Under this heading a National Bank has been established, a sound budgetary system is being developed, and plans are underway for a system of export and import controls.</item>
<item>(2) The necessary formal papers have been signed covering the commitment of US funds.</item>
<item>(3) There are still gaps in this program, however, and I would suggest a briefing at an early date by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PGE1">Gardner Palmer</persName>, who has been monitoring this program.</item>
</list>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">f. Education and Cultural Assistance Program.</p>
<list>
<item>(1) This program was suggested by the French primarily, I fear, as a safeguard to French cultural interests in Vietnam. The French are very sensitive on this subject. They fear that the English language may displace French, and American methods of administration and education will gradually displace French procedures. In consequence, they have tried to restrict the number of officers and men to be sent to American military schools, and opposed the introduction of American advisers into the various ministries.</item>
<item>(2) Nonetheless, they reluctantly agreed to the establishment of an Institute of Public Administration in Saigon to be operated under the direction of the Michigan State University. Considerable delays developed in Washington in consummating this contract, but it has finally been signed and the Director and small staff will arrive in Saigon shortly.</item>
<item>(3) The French have also finally agreed to the establishment of an International Center for the teaching of foreign languages, including English. This program is being supported by the USIS.</item>
<item>(4) In addition, through <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>, we are furnishing assistance along with the French to develop normal schools and otherwise improve the Vietnamese educational system.</item>

<p rend="sectiontitleital">g. Reorganization and Increased Effectiveness of Vietnamese Government.</p>
<list>
<item>(1) The original <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Cabinet contained very few men of ability and had a very narrow political base. Unfortunately, every effort to persuade <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to take into his Cabinet men of ability has met with failure. Instead, because of the President’s method of operating, he has lost practically all of the able men who were in his Cabinet.</item>
<item>(2) It is too early to say how the new Cabinet will function. Very few of its members have had any experience in public life, and their capabilities are unknown. Fortunately, a Minister of Interior has finally been appointed but the President retains the Ministry of Defense, a condition which in the past has been a detriment to the operations of this key Ministry.</item>
<item>(3) Another essential weakness in the Government structure has been the hodgepodge of administrative arrangements between the National Government and the regional, provincial, and community governments. One of the functions of the Institute of Public Administration, under the direction of Michigan State University, will be to make a study of these relationships.</item>
<item>(4) Finally, a decision must be reached by the Vietnamese people as to the ultimate structure of their Government and its relationship <pb xml:id="pg_393" n="393" facs="0423"/>to the French Union. You are familiar with the current struggle between <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and their respective adherents, with the French actively engaged in the background.</item>
</list>
<p>5. Rather than discuss, in this report, our plans (a) for reorganizing the National Police establishments and (b) for integrating sect forces into the National Army, I have attached drafts of both,<note n="7" xml:id="d183fn7">Neither of these draft plans is attached to the source text; a discussion of these issues and recommendations of action is in despatch 358 from Saigon, April 28. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> Central Files, 751G.5/4–2855)</note> so that, if you desire, you may become well acquainted with them prior to your arrival at Saigon. I would advise that you review these plans, together with the conscription program for the Armed Forces, with your advisers in Saigon and then discuss them with President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and the appropriate members of his new government at an early date.</p>
<p>6. Thus, though you can see much has been accomplished to assist Vietnam to establish a strong viable government and economy, much remains to be done. The problems involved are full of so many unpredictable factors and the situation is so volatile that anything can happen. You have a formidable task awaiting you and I wish you the very best of success in your mission.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 36. Second tripartite meeting on Vietnam took place Hotel Matignon 10:30 p.m. May 10. US Delegation headed by Secretary, <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>, Merchant, and MacArthur; French by <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> and Laforest; <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> by <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen</persName> (in <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s absence).</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> opened conversation by expressing regret at <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s initiative in reorganizing govt while conversations taking place Paris.<note n="2" xml:id="d184fn2">According to <gloss target="#t_Tosec1">Tosec</gloss> 17 to Paris, May 10, South Vietnam’s reorganized cabinet, announced by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> on May 10, was a compromise between representatives of political groups and technicians. The cabinet was not made up of men of stature; they were, however, all <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> loyalists. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/5–955)</note> Commented on increasing violence anti-French propaganda in Vietnamese <pb xml:id="pg_394" n="394" facs="0424"/>press Saigon. Since previous meeting French had given careful study to question and would have something specific to say. Regrettable that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was facing us with fait accompli before we could agree on plan.</p>
<p>Secretary replied that he had made some notes which gave general lines of US thinking. They did not put forward suggestions of concrete character and were not to be considered as official document, aide-mémoire or otherwise (Secretary gave copy to <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName>). Principal points Secretary’s paper<note n="3" xml:id="d184fn3">Not found in Department of State files.</note> (full text will follow in minutes) was that (1) Indochina as important as it is does not justify being source serious discord between France and US; (2) both France and US have offered to withdraw their interests if it would improve matters. US offer stands. If French withdrew US would continue support anti-Communist nationalist govt in Vietnam but would hope Franco-US cooperation would not make it necessary for US do so alone; (3) US would use its influence with any Vietnamese Govt to protect French lives and property if French forces should be withdrawn. US does not believe Vietnamese army yet in position to control situation and notes that Geneva Accords may preclude introduction of any fresh US military forces; (4) US hopes that common Franco-American policy can be arrived at. US could not accept arbitrary removal of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> from power. Could not French bring themselves to support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> with strengthened govt pending representative process to establish new govt which might or might not include <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>? US would use its offices to support such electoral procedures. US has already urged moderate policy upon <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and will continue do so.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> expressed agreement with (1) and (2). Commented that it was difficult for one country to abandon its deeply-held convictions in favor those of another. Expressed conviction that if one country should leave Vietnam would in effect mean abandonment by both. Would be deeply regrettable for common interest.</p>
<p>Secretary reiterated that US would continue support independent anti-Communist Vietnamese Govt even if French should evacuate Vietnam but observed that chances of success would be less.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> stated that when he had suggested that French withdraw he realized that implementing such step would entail delays. Would have to be accomplished in manner designed avoid any indication that it was result of Franco-US clash. Would be progressive. During French review of last few days it was generally agreed that situation although very bad did not preclude finding certain common ground in Franco-US views and, if developed, this common ground might permit eventual support by both countries of common policy. Last paragraph Secretary’s paper provided such common ground. Prospect <pb xml:id="pg_395" n="395" facs="0425"/>of reenforced govt until electoral procedures for formation National Assembly established appeared to French as acceptable policy. Could lead to eventual govt which might or might not include <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. French do not consider steps <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> took May 10 to enlarge govt as those which they regard as necessary. They involve increase in personnel without increase in political representation.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> observed that during last few days there have been indications in press that France had chosen policy of collaboration with north as against that with south. He wished deny this emphatically. Completely false that France is playing “double game”. French now prepared to take specific steps to disprove it. French proposal is as follows: Taking last paragraph of Secretary’s paper as framework French agree: 1) Abandon demand that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> be replaced. <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> prepared to make this concession in recognition difficulties US Congress and public opinion. Represents very hard decision for <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> personally and his govt politically. Earlier during day delegations of Deputies had called upon <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> demanding that he hold firm. Nevertheless <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> now agrees not only to relinquish demand that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> go but to support him fully as head of govt. However France agrees to this only on condition that: (1) Govt is broadened into real govt of national union; (2) Vietnamese Govt cease its anti-French propaganda.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> enlarged upon foregoing, stating that if it is agreed French will make conscientious effort support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. He observed that this means that if there are complaints about individuals on both sides who do not conform to policy, attention will be drawn to this fact and changes of personnel will take place. French and Americans must admit to each other that certain individuals make policy difficult. French prepared guarantee they will carry out their share and if necessary remove individuals concerned on understanding US will reciprocate. Broadening of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> govt must be political broadening. Personalities must be admitted to govt who represent political factions and not simply individuals, no matter how highly qualified.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> continued to observe that as far as sects were concerned, their rallying to govt must be obtained, this task should be easier if govt is truly one of national union and enjoys support of French and US Govts. No further disorders can be countenanced and force must not be used to settle disagreements. Solution must not require “extermination of sects”, rather must they adjust themselves to new enlarged Govt. Members of sects are indeed in many instances “gangsters” but others have in past been loyal. Many have decorations for their gallantry in fighting Vietminh during war. We must take steps to prevent sects from going undergound into guerrilla activity. In French opinion primary effort should be made to rally them as soon as govt enlarged. French guaranteed to assist in bringing this to pass <pb xml:id="pg_396" n="396" facs="0426"/>and not, as has been falsely stated in past, to assist sects in activity against Govt.</p>
<p>French agreement to this plan does not mean, <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> continued, that they are any more convinced than ever that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will prove to be good Minister. They still think that they should give him fair chance.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> turned to his third point remarking that French deplored <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s attacks against French. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> used method of attacking Fr as means inflating himself and acquiring popularity. Fr cannot support govt if it pursues such tactics. Even if <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> personally agreed to do so French Parliament would not permit it US must make <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> renounce such attitude. French believe that in excusing such methods <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> exaggerates importance anti-French propaganda in Vietnam. If French should agree to support him there is no need to carry on anti-French tactics.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> turned to question Expeditionary Corps, observing that France will continue plan of repatriation on gradual scale in order prove that they do not wish maintain armed force Vietnam as means holding on to their own authority. Expeditionary Corps will be withdrawn down to a certain level which US and French will agree to in advance. Such withdrawal should have effect proving to Viet Govt sincerity French intentions. One possible step, as suggested by Minister Laforest, would be gradual withdrawal French forces to Cap St. Jacques where they would be less conspicuous.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> then turned to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, observing that in interest of formula suggested above it is best to use <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> to provide legality needed to support program. This must not be interpreted as indicating French approval of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> personally. They think he about “used up” but nevertheless recognize fact that he represents legality and provides principle of legitimacy which may prove valuable in future. French believe that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> should be told of what has been decided in these meetings. Would welcome US view this regard.</p>
<p>In closing <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> resumed that difficult and most important point of their plan is to achieve true broadening of govt. Observed that it is difficult to view problem from Paris. Only experts on spot are really qualified to pass judgment and French hope that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> will be given full authority to take decisions on spot.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> stated that main <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> premise was that allied policy be fixed which all can support. <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> did not believe that “game was lost” but rather that it had chances of being won if played together. <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had requested expression of views on subject from <persName corresp="#p_MDM1">Malcolm MacDonald</persName> who had just cabled them from Saigon. His main points were (1) <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is in very strong position and in fact in control whether we like it or not; (2) Paramount need is for broadening national admin, <pb xml:id="pg_397" n="397" facs="0427"/>representing maximum possible control. Therefore, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> hopes <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will enlarge govt by encouraging all elements with exception Vietminh; (3) Full discretion and authority should be given to Fr and US representatives on spot as to how this should be done; (4) If <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> after reasonable time still balks his replacement by another should be considered with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> possibly retained to take ministerial post in Govt, but at this stage this need not be considered.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> observed that <persName corresp="#p_MDM1">MacDonald</persName> suggestions little different from those <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> and should provide basis for moving ahead. He agreed fully with Secretary’s statements on Expeditionary Corps. <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> agreed that Vietnam army not yet capable of controlling situation. <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and <persName corresp="#p_MDM1">MacDonald</persName> believe that withdrawal <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> would create vacuum from which only Vietminh would profit. They are convinced that <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> provides stabilizing factor. <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> added personal observation that from his experience in Greece in 1944 and 1950 it was proved to him how essential it was to have some reserve power on the spot to avoid putsch which is always possible against weak govt.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> observed that <persName corresp="#p_MDM1">MacDonald</persName>’s views carried great weight because of his wide experience in area. He hoped <persName corresp="#p_MDM1">MacDonald</persName> would cooperate with <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> in formation future recommendations.</p>
<p>Secretary observed that since we were speaking very frankly in his opinion plan seemed acceptable, but he was not sure we see situation alike from standpoint of spirit of occasion. He observed that while <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> lacked many qualities and was by no means a perfect head of govt he should not be regarded as calamity which we must bear but rather as emergence of nationalist anti-Communist force which was needed if country was to be saved in end from Communist control.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is not person to whom one can dictate. US cannot undertake to force upon him govt or policies which he does not like. We will do best we can. He has mind and will of his own and fact that he has survived proves he has virtues not easily replaced. Any man who would blindly accept US bidding would not be worth supporting. We must reconcile ourselves to fact that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> may be anti-French and may later become anti-American. Secretary cited example of <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Syngman Rhee</persName><note n="4" xml:id="d184fn4">President of the Republic of Korea.</note> who although at times anti-US and anti-<persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> represented independent qualities of man who not amenable to direction. These things are distasteful to US but they must be put up with. We must not believe that after electoral machinery formed we will be able to get rid of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. We should not look upon <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> as experiment to be got rid of. Even if we chose to, we might not be able to do so. Secretary said if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> feels we are trying to get rid of <pb xml:id="pg_398" n="398" facs="0428"/>him, like all orientals, he will naturally be suspicious and not take our advice and hoped that if we should try to put into effect <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> plan we should do so with knowledge that govt will be anti-West and not fully as efficient as we liked but it may have qualities which would help preserve country from Communism. Secretary observed that he did not know of another oriental govt where Western standards of coalition apply and not run by strong individual. It may be impossible to force coalition upon <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and force him to take in men who oppose him. Secretary therefore hoped we would try as best we could to strengthen Govt’s influence. French must not consider that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is “in US pocket”. If he were he could not be reliably supported in future.</p>
<p>Secretary continued by turning to question of sects, stating that distinction should be made between Binh Xuyen and others. Binh Xuyen are gangsters like those known in large cities of US who exist on revenues from gambling, prostitution, etc. Control of police by Binh Xuyen is intolerable. Situation must be cleared up. US recognizes that <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> and Hoa Hao are different and ought not be liquidated by force but rather through gradual processes amalgamation by diplomatic and political procedures. This did not mean we admire Hoa Hao. We deplore <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> if he requires allowances, which Secretary doubts, should obtain them from state rather than from a cut in vice ring. As regards <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> Secretary shared French view that thread of legitimacy should be retained until new format is established but <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> must accept a passive role. US does not wish to bring <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s reign to end as long as it is compatible with independent regime in Vietnam. Secretary closed by suggesting that conversation should be terminated then to be continued at later date.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> expressed complete agreement and stated he would prepare memo May 11 in preparation for next meeting.<note n="5" xml:id="d184fn5">See <ref target="#d186">Document 186</ref>.</note> Memorandum would outline French position. <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> remarked that he agreed that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is force and that individual force representing rise in nationalism is to be expected in country such as Vietnam. Agreed on “principle of concentrated power,” but did not agree that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is man to carry it out. French do not intend to play <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> against <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. If there were someone else who is really valuable both <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> could be dispensed with. French understood that after initial period of supporting <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> there would be electoral consultations when it will be decided whether <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is best solution or not. French trust it will be found that he is. French recognize that US hopes that it will be decided at time of National Assembly that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is the man but must state that French believe that he will not be. French are ready to concede that they are wrong if such proves to be case.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_399" n="399" facs="0429"/>
<p>Secretary observed that US was not at all sure that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would succeed. He lacks essential qualities but fact remains that there is no one better to replace him. He will be lost if he is not backed wholeheartedly.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> observed in closing that Secretary had confirmed <persName corresp="#p_MDM1">MacDonald</persName>’s views.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> closed by stating that if US wishes to give <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> full chance French would subscribe entirely to doing so but only if France had guarantees and compensation as outlined.<note n="6" xml:id="d184fn6"><p>After this second tripartite meeting on Vietnam, two private conversations of interest took place between French and American officials. The first was between <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> and, according to a signed memorandum of conversation by <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, May 11, it was as follows:</p>
<p>“Following our talks at the Hotel Matignon last night, as we were leaving, <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> took me apart and said to me privately that as a result of our talks, he had been much shaken (’ebranlé’) in his views. He also had been greatly impressed by my statement that in that part of the world, there was no such thing as a ‘coalition’ government, but one-man governments. However, he did not know how to meet us without having some political concession that he could point to, as he could not face his Cabinet and Parliament on a program of having merely ‘sold out’ 100 per cent to the Americans.” (<persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Library, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> Papers, Indochina June 1954–April 1956)</p>
<p>The second was reported in <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 38, May 11, which reads:</p>
<p>“As we were leaving meeting reported <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 36, Margerie said privately we should know that in any event strength of <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> would continue to be gradually and unobtrusively reduced. He did not know what rate would be but seemed fully aware of dangers of precipitate or unduly publicized withdrawals.”</p>
<p>“He commented that there was vicious circle. ‘Too many of wrong kind of French’ would stay in Saigon as long as they felt <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> was there to protect their interests and as long as they remained, presence of <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> was needed to protect them and their interests.” (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/5–1155)</p>

<pb xml:id="pg_400" n="400" facs="0430"/>
<p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
<p>I have not had time to write you since day before yesterday. Tuesday night<note n="2" xml:id="d185fn2">May 10.</note> we had another long session with the French on Indochina and again last night, both sessions lasting until 1 a.m.<note n="3" xml:id="d185fn3">See <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 36, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>, and <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 42, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</note> I am trying to do the hard thing which is actually to persuade them that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is the best hope and that that hope is a possibility only if we treat him as the head of an independent government and not as a puppet to whom we can dictate. The French seemed to think that all we need to do is to crack the whip. I keep emphasizing that if that is the case, then the situation would be hopeless because he could never gain the confidence of his own people. I really think I have made progress. <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> professes to have been genuinely converted.</p>
<p>Last night matters came to a head. <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> wanted us to make an agreement with the French as to our future policies including efforts to influence <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. I said we would not make any agreement because the subject matter did not lend itself to precision and any agreement would almost surely lead to charges and countercharges. I said I would draft our instructions to our Ambassador following the lines of our policy as previously expounded, and that we would show our instructions to the French for their information, and that I hoped the French would send corresponding instructions to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> which we could see, but that it must be clear that we were following what I hoped would be paralleled courses because this was in the common interest, but that neither of us had any formal engagements to the other. This they accepted, and the work is going forward on this basis.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> has been sitting in on some of our meetings and the information which he has from <persName corresp="#p_MDM1">Malcolm MacDonald</persName> conforms closely to our own thinking so that the British have been helpful.</p>
<p>[Here follows a report on discussions at Paris unrelated to Indochina.]</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 42. From <gloss target="#t_USDel1">USDel</gloss>. Third trilateral meeting on Vietnam took three hours Wednesday<note n="2" xml:id="d186fn2">May 11.</note> evening with the three Ministers making similar general proposals. Some details are still ambiguous.</p>
<p>In late afternoon French delivered to us informal paper summarizing <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName>’s points of previous meetings. French paper stated French Government can accept Secretary’s formula on following conditions: (1) An enlargement of the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government and an acceleration of an electoral process. (2) Peaceful solution of the problem of the sects. (3) Cessation of anti-French propaganda. (4) Continuation of the present role of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. (5) Reciprocal removal from Vietnam of French and US functionaries who are deemed disturbing to Franco-US harmony. (6) US assurance that French economic, cultural and financial relations in Vietnam will be nurtured.</p>
<p>Secretary opened trilateral with following comments on the French paper: (1) We must recognize revolutionary spirit prevailing in Vietnam. We cannot deal with this if we have a government to which we can dictate. (2) Conditions in French paper are desirable, but US could not guarantee to get them unless <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> were our puppet. But if he were our puppet, the whole enterprise in Vietnam would fail. (3) We have to take gamble we can succeed with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> who is there as the man who may develop an acceptable moderate government. Alternative may be sheer disaster for everybody. Any government that could give guarantees desired by French would not survive but would be followed by violently extremist revolutionary movement resulting in Communist control. (4) We do not see how we can get rid of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and there seems nobody to take his place. There is hope if we can win his trust and confidence. (5) The Secretary strongly urged France not to ask US for guarantees we cannot give without turning <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> into a puppet and total failure. Secretary emphasized <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is independent force on whom we cannot arbitrarily impose our views. It would be very false to assume we could give dependable assurances on the French conditions. (6) Relationship with Vietnam should not arise out of exacting commitments but through mutual confidence and trust. Secretary strongly hoped US and French could work together on formula he had suggested without specific obligations from the US.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_402" n="402" facs="0432"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> then stated that <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>’s interest was matter based on two main considerations: (1) What happened in Vietnam was of vital concern to all of Southeast Asia where <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had interests and (2) <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>’s particular interest in Geneva Accords in which Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> had taken role in negotiating. <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> agreed with us that latter govt could not guarantee what <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could or could not do for independence of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> govt was essential point but <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> did believe that US could influence what <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> govt did or did not do. US and French appear to be in accord on what should be done but question was how. <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> view was that question should be accomplished by establishing principle that US and French must work as team. This would start with <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and work down line where cooperation would serve as example to Vietnamese. If this were done common purposes could be carried out. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could not be ordered about but he could be influenced by example that it is possible for US and French to work together in friendly cooperation. Future program should not depend on written guarantee but on mutual sense of cooperation. Local representatives of France and US should be given full authority. As far as Vietnam Govt is concerned no one should be ruled out from taking part in it except Communists. Successful program does not depend on signed agreement but rather on good will displayed on both sides in Saigon as well as Paris and Washington. Vietnam Govt must be prepared for forthcoming talks with Vietminh. Vietminh must not be allowed to seize initiative and above all problem must not be thrown back to Geneva Co-Chairmen for solution.</p>
<p>After making several comments on Secretary’s outlines, many of which were repetition of what had been said in previous sessions, <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> indicated agreement in principle. He confirmed that French conditions were not meant to entail engagement by US. He said he would like to reach specific agreement. He hoped <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would prove to be dependable force and not weakness. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> should be used only to extent needed. <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Edgar Faure</persName> then read following paper which includes French six-point program.</p>
<list>
<item>French Govt desiring to approach its point of view to that of US Govt is disposed to accept suggestion made by latter that it give its support to reenforced Vietnamese Govt headed by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and that, during period necessary for organization of procedure of consultation out of which might come a new govt including or not including <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, sets forth practical aspects of this policy as follows:</item>
<item>(1) Support given by two governments to this new formula would be complete, loyal and sincere. In this respect French Govt proposes that two governments should transfer from Saigon those functionaries or agents who on one side or other would appear to be guilty of ill will in pursuance of new common policy. (2) <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> govt would be re-enforced. That is to say that it would be enlarged by <pb xml:id="pg_403" n="403" facs="0433"/>means of operation which would go beyond that effected during these last few days limited to addition of few technicians and intellectuals not representing any political point of view. This enlargement could be studied on the spot by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> in collaboration with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MDM1">MacDonald</persName> and should take place during period of from three to four weeks. (3) Procedure of popular consultation should be put into effect under terms of which parties would decide if there is means of establishing new governmental formula and if in this new formula <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should continue to be present, should take another Cabinet job or should disappear. (4) Given great difficulty of making this procedure acceptable to large sectors of French Parliament and public opinion American Govt should exercise all its influence on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to cease violent anti-French activities. (5) Expeditionary Corps would continue to be repatriated at present rate and period of pause foreseen for next summer would not be maintained except after new examination of situation. This operation would not be stopped until Expeditionary Corps was reduced to figure which will be fixed subsequently, and which will take into account views of our local representatives. Part of Expeditionary Corps could be regrouped in Cap Saint-Jacques region. (6) It should finally be agreed that as result of this new plan interested Govts have intention of aiding state of South Vietnam to prepare itself under best possible conditions for test of free elections which are placed for 1956. It should not be admitted by them that any complicated actions of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should in effect have object of avoiding this test.</item>
</list>
<p>Secretary said <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName>’s suggestion helpful at this stage but repeated his statement that the situation does not lend itself to a contractual arrangement between the two governments. Essentially we are dealing with a third force or forces whom we are not able to control. Therefore in lieu of any contractual agreement the Secretary was prepared to state the general direction of US policy and he hoped the French Government would do the same so that both governments could proceed on the knowledge of what the other intends to do.</p>
<list>
<item>1. It is US policy to give <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government complete and sincere support.</item>
<item>2. US desires <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government be strengthened but US recognizes limitations on what it can do to bring this about. Perhaps the best way to strengthen <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government is by including effective technicians rather than by creating a coalition of diverse and mutually conflicting elements.</item>
<item>3. US would be agreeable if the French Government wishes to indicate any of our personnel who have acted improperly or hostilely to French interests. It is the US policy to require US officials loyally to carry out US policies and not engage in activities conflicting with our common objectives.</item>
<item>4. The US believes there should be developed as rapidly as possible procedures for elections to bring about some representative process so that the Vietnamese Government can have a more secure basis and some more dependable method for change.</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_404" n="404" facs="0434"/>
<item>5. The US would exercise its influence with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to restrain anti-French propaganda, as the US has already done. The best way to bring about a cessation of such propaganda is to develop a genuine feeling in the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government that France is not trying to overthrow it.</item>
<item>6. The US believes that elections under the Geneva Accords should take place in 1956 if they can be conducted under conditions of freedom.</item>
<item>7. The French policy statement regarding the progressive reduction of <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> is acceptable on the assumption that the withdrawal of the French forces and French instructors would be harmonized with the buildup of the Vietnamese National Army.</item>
</list>
<p><persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> stated he was in agreement with these general lines and understood that they did not represent any kind of a control. He felt that there was a basis for agreement between France and the US. Therefore he suggested preparing instructions to our field representatives to ask them to do the best they can along these general lines. <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> said these talks had helped him understand the US viewpoint much better. He now feels the future depends primarily upon the climate of confidence between Americans and French in Vietnam. He stated there could be no doubt whatsoever on French intentions.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> summarized the common objectives as follows:</p>
<list>
<item>(1) The existing government of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> should be fully supported by all parties for the present.</item>
<item>(2) All efforts should be directed towards its reinforcement as soon as possible.</item>
<item>(3) All efforts should be made toward the essential creation of a method of popular consultation prior to the next phase.</item>
<item>(4) All anti-West propaganda should be suppressed.</item>
<item>(5) An agreement should be achieved on a safety limit for the reduction of the Expeditionary Corps.</item>
<item>(6) Vietnam Government should be urged to make preparations for approaching the Viet Minh about the elections after July 29th, 1955.</item>
</list>
<p><persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> suggested experts meet Thursday to draft a short paper on the points of agreement in order that instructions might be in harmony. <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> assured the Secretary that such a paper would not be a commitment or engagement but only a basis for the activities of our representatives. The Secretary said he preferred to have his advisers draft statement of US policy which could be shown to the French for any suggestions that they wished to make in it. They could submit the same to US. It seemed generally understood that experts would meet Thursday.<note n="3" xml:id="d186fn3">See <ref target="#d189">Document 189</ref>.</note></p>
<p>The French suggested brief generalizing joint communiqué which omitted any mention of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. Secretary said absence of his name <pb xml:id="pg_405" n="405" facs="0435"/>would create a great mystery, but French would not accept mentioning <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, so communiqué postponed.</p>

<p>723. From <gloss target="#t_USDel1">USDel</gloss>. Saigon personal for <persName corresp="#p_KRA1">Kidder</persName> from Secretary. We have now for four days and nights been reviewing the situation with Premier <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> and Ministers <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> and LaForest and their advisers. We have consistently maintained the position that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s government must be supported and that this support must be unconditional, and that while we would naturally offer it any advice or suggestions that would be welcomed, we were not in a position to give any undertakings on behalf of that government.</p>
<p>The French Government have now acquiesced in our point of view, and we expect today to draft broad instructions<note n="2" xml:id="d187fn2"><hi rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note> in this sense which will guide you and the Ambassador when he arrives in your future relations. We shall show this to the French. We hope that the French will also draft instructions which, while not identical, will require their representatives also to support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, although for reasons of domestic policy, they may not be able to say so publicly.</p>
<p>The status of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> has not been discussed except in a very marginal way. We have taken the position that it may be useful to preserve a thread of legitimacy at least pending orderly consideration of this problem by representative Vietnamese processes and assuming that <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> does not in the interval attempt arbitrary interference in governmental processes.</p>
<p>You may informally advise <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in above sense as a personal message from me.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 46. We have had a very thorough exchange of views with President <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> and the interested French Ministers, with the participation of Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>. As a result there is, we believe, a good understanding on the part of each of the viewpoint of the other and a fresh basis for useful cooperation to save Free Vietnam. As a result of this exchange of views, the US has formulated the following instructions for the guidance of yourself and all other US official elements in Vietnam:</p>
<p>1. You will continue to give complete, loyal and sincere support to the present government of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and you should deal with it as the independent and sovereign government which we believe it is and should be.</p>
<p>2. We would like to see that government strengthened. We note that some progress has already been made in that direction. We believe that further strengthening is still possible and desirable. The US has no right and no desire to dictate the composition of the government of an independent and sovereign state. If, however, there is an appropriate occasion, you will inform Premier <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that the magnitude of the problems confronting the Government of Free Vietnam is such as to call for a government which includes both technical competence and a broad representation. We would not expect the inclusion of those who would not loyally support the government’s program. We would greatly hope that a sense of patriotism would make it possible to organize a government of a truly national character.</p>
<p>In developing this question of strengthening the government, you will maintain contact with your French and British colleagues.</p>
<p>3. It is the US view that the lawful government should exercise unquestioned authority not only over the National Army but also over the National Police.</p>
<p>4. The Binh Xuyen should be disbanded, and its dependable elements incorporated into the national life of Vietnam. We believe that there should be a gradual and peaceful amalgamation of sects having a genuine cultural existence into the normal life of Vietnam. You may, as there are appropriate occasions, make known our views in that respect and exert any proper influence in the direction indicated.</p>
<p>5. You should encourage the development of electoral machinery and representative processes such as are suitable to Vietnam in order <pb xml:id="pg_407" n="407" facs="0437"/>to create a stable support for the national government and make possible orderly governmental changes from time to time.</p>
<p>6. We deplore the existence of tension as between the various elements which need to cooperate if Vietnam is to preserve its freedom. Therefore, you will exert yourself to bring about a cessation of anti-French propaganda on the part of the Government of Vietnam. We have been assured by the French Government that its attitude is such that a basis exists for the cessation in Vietnam of propaganda from one side or another which only irritates the relations which need to be cordial.</p>
<p>7. While neither the US nor the Government of Vietnam is a party to the Geneva Armistice Agreement, we believe that both should envisage the holding of free elections in 1956, under genuine conditions of freedom, without intimidation before or reprisals after. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> expressed himself in this sense to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> when he was in Saigon in March, and this continues to be US policy.</p>
<p>8. For your information, we understand that there will be a progressive reduction of French forces in Vietnam, which, however, we believe will be at a rhythm consistent with the increasing capabilities of the Vietnam National Armed Forces but that the reduction will come to a pause when some minimum level has been reached. We also understand that a part of the French Expeditionary Corps will be regrouped in the region of Cap Saint-Jacques so that it will be less conspicuous than in the populated Saigon area. You will be advised further of this by your French colleague. We trust that the Government of Vietnam will welcome this arrangement and will not disturb it by now demanding any complete removal of French forces, which we believe would be undesirable at the present time.</p>
<p>We also understand that the French will so order their dealings with the Viet Minh in the north as to avoid any appearance of an equivocal posture.</p>
<p>9. In conclusion, we emphasize that we do not believe that freedom can be saved in Vietnam if violent revolutionary forces are brought into play. Almost surely the Viet Minh would end up by capturing control of the revolution because this is a process at which they are past masters. We believe that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should now be in a position, with the clear support of the French and the US, to adopt moderate and constructive policies, to delegate responsibility without fear that this will endanger his political life and that there may be carried forward with vigor, competence and broad understanding the agreed program for developing a national government which will have the general support of the freedom-loving people of Vietnam and the confidence of friendly foreign governments.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Polto1">Polto</gloss> 2308. For Acting Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName>. Tripartite Ministerial Meeting.</p>
<p>1. At conclusion of tripartite ministerial meeting on Indochina May 11 (<gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 42<note n="2" xml:id="d189fn2"><ref target="#d186">Document 186</ref>.</note>) I said that in my judgment, best manner to proceed would be for us to draft instructions<note n="3" xml:id="d189fn3">The text of those instructions is in <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 46, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> which we would be glad to show to French and British before putting them in final form. French could at same time draft instructions to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>. Pursuant to this understanding US and French advisers met afternoon May 12 with <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> also represented. We presented our draft for their comments and French presented their draft instructions for ours. French instructions were in two parts: first consisted of résumé of tripartite discussions which did not correctly portray our position. Second consisted of their instructions to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>. French sought our approval to their instructions indicating willingness discuss modification their language in effort obtain concurrence their instructions. US advisers refused to do this. I had pointed out to French my opinion that complicated nature Vietnamese problem did not lend itself to making firm and detailed agreements between us and any attempt to do so might well pave way for mutual recriminations later. Therefore, I have suggested and insisted upon this scheme of parallel but unagreed instructions as a substitute procedure.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_409" n="409" facs="0439"/>
<p>2. Following yesterday’s meeting with French, I went over French suggestions on our draft instructions and put them in final form (see immediately preceding telegram<note n="4" xml:id="d189fn4">According to <gloss target="#t_Polto1">Polto</gloss> 2315, May 14, this telegram was drafted and approved by <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and should have been sent in the <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> series. (Department of State, Central Files, 396.1/5–1455) Therefore, the immediately preceding telegram was <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 46, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note>). Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> will show these final instructions May 13 to French informing them we have given full consideration to their suggestions and have taken them into account in preparing our final draft. In conveying substance our instructions to French, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> will make clear that: (a) these are views of US Government taking into account French comments; (b) it is our earnest hope that French instructions to <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> will be along same lines; (c) in accordance with views I expressed to <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName>, we feel French instructions should not include any reference to points made by either side at talks and should not purport to indicate any bipartite or tripartite “agreement”. They should merely be unilateral French instructions finalized after receiving US comments on their first draft.</p>
<p>3. After some discussion it was agreed that no communiqué on Vietnam would be issued at termination of tripartite meetings. However, each side has individually told the press that we have reached a common judgement as to correct approach to problem.</p>

<p rend="center">DRAFT STATEMENT OF U.S. POLICY ON ALL-VIETNAM ELECTIONS</p>
<p rend="center">General Considerations</p>
<p>1. It is U.S. policy to maintain a friendly non-Communist Free Vietnam; to assist Free Vietnam to maintain (a) military forces necessary for internal security, and (b) economic conditions conducive to the maintenance of the strength of the non-Communist regime; and to prevent a Communist victory through all-Vietnam elections.</p>
<p>2. Free Vietnamese strength is essential to any effective approach to the election problem. If Free Vietnam is to cope adequately with national elections it will have to be strong enough to deter or defeat Vietminh insurrections in its territory, to impose and sustain order in its territory, and to win a free election limited to its own zone and held under its own auspices and control. Otherwise, the Vietminh can take over through internal insurrections or the Government of Free Vietnam will be so weak that it will find it difficult even to give lip service to the idea of national unification through elections, or to insist on adequate conditions for free elections.</p>
<p>3. U.S. policy toward all-Vietnam elections should be predicated on the assumption that there is a possibility of assisting Free Vietnam to achieve the degree of strength described above. If it becomes clear that Free Vietnam cannot achieve such strength, U.S. policy toward Free Vietnam, should be reviewed.</p>
<p>4. U.S. policy must also protect against a Communist take-over of Free Vietnam, even if the Communists were able to win elections under safeguards in North Vietnam. On the other hand, U.S. policy should be prepared to take advantage of the unlikely possibility that North Vietnam might be freed through elections.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_412" n="412" facs="0442"/>
<p rend="center">Courses of Action</p>
<p>5. Continue to encourage the Government of Free Vietnam to proceed with the consultations about elections called for in July 1955 by the Geneva Agreements.</p>
<p>6. Provide the Government of Free Vietnam with information and advice about Communist positions and tactics with regard to elections elsewhere, e.g., Greece, Germany, Austria and Korea.</p>
<p>7. Assist the Government of Free Vietnam to make it clear that any failure to secure free elections is the fault of the Communists.</p>
<p>8. Encourage the Government of Free Vietnam:</p>
<list>
<item>a. To lay stress on the necessity of compliance with the stipulation of the Geneva Agreements that “all the necessary conditions obtain for free expression of the national will” before all-Vietnam elections can take place. For this purpose the Government of Free Vietnam should insist in the first instance on adequate guarantees of freedom of elections<note n="7" xml:id="d190fn7"><p>For examples of such guarantees, see para. 8 of the attached Staff Study. [Footnote in the source text. Paragraph 8 reads as follows:</p>
<p>[“8. In negotiating for conditions of genuine freedom for the holding of elections, Free Vietnam can serve both these objectives by insisting on provisions such as those already supported by the Western Powers at Berlin: Agreement on safeguards to assure conditions of genuine freedom before, after, and during elections; full powers for any Supervisory Commission to act to ensure free elections and to guarantee against prior coercion or subsequent reprisal; adequate guarantees for, among other things, freedom of movement, freedom of presentation of candidates, immunity of candidates, freedom from arbitrary arrest or victimization, freedom of association and political meetings, freedom of expression for all, freedom of press, radio, and free circulation of newspapers, secrecy of vote, security of polling stations and ballot boxes. The Communists would find it most difficult to accept such conditions or to allow their implementation if accepted. Accordingly, it would be useful for the Free Vietnamese to center their position on securing agreement to conditions for free elections prior to discussion of the forms and objectives of the elections.”]</p></note> and adequate supervisory powers in a Supervisory Commission.</item>
<item>b. To adopt positions with respect to the objectives and details of elections which: (1) will avoid terms which would be likely to result in a Communist take-over of Free Vietnam; and (2) to the degree feasible, will maintain a position generally consistent with that adopted by the Free World in other areas such as Korea and Germany.</item>
</list>
<p>9. Seek British and French support for the foregoing courses of action.</p>
<p>10. If pursuit of the above policy should result in a renewal of hostilities by the Communists, the U.S., in the light of the general circumstances then prevailing, should be prepared to oppose any Communist attack with U.S. armed forces, if necessary and feasible—consulting the Congress in advance if the emergency permits—preferably in concert with the Manila Pact allies of the U.S., but if necessary alone.</p>

<p>1312. 1. <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> returned Hanoi May 12 and I made courtesy call this morning during which we had one hour general conversation.</p>
<p>2. He was very pessimistic about situation in South Vietnam, expressing opinion that continued support of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> amounted to “opening door to Communism in south”. Said that intensely nationalistic Phan Ke Toai had been the “<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>” of earlier period and had paved way for Communist victory. Saw great present danger as not that Viet Minh would win eventual elections, but that population of south, contrasting insecurity in that area with tranquillity reigning in north would disregard Communist nature of Viet Minh and welcome them to restore peace and order even at price of Communist oppression.</p>
<p>3. He was not optimistic about situation in north which he said was getting no better (from Western point of view). Remarked “It is Chinese who will replace us here”. I took occasion to say that Chinese Communist penetration seemed so far advanced already, citing particularly railroad construction and airport control, that I was not at all sure Viet Minh had any freedom of choice in formulating policy. <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> said he was not sure either, but he felt that Viet Minh were not yet completely under Chinese Communist domination, that they did not want it and that they instinctively resisted it. Partition of Vietnam at 17th parallel would merely encourage Chinese to annex North Vietnam, an ambition they have never abandoned. (As I arrived at Maison de France an automobile flying Chinese Communist flag dropped three Chinese in civilian uniform who disappeared into building presumably to see Billecocq or Arnod.)</p>
<p>4. <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> said he had left Paris before conclusion conversations on <gloss target="#t_IC1">IC</gloss>, but understood that French position now called for going ahead with elections under Geneva agreement while giving <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> as much support as possible so that he might make strongest possible showing in election.</p>
<p>5. French interests in North Vietnam just about liquidated except for Hanoi tramway and few buildings. Member of Messageries Maritimes still at Thai Phong for time being. (<persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> had told British Consul General last week that there was possibility negotiating some sort of Franco-Viet Minh commercial agreement.)</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_414" n="414" facs="0444"/>
<p>6. He had recently seen <persName corresp="#p_PVD1">Pham Van Dong</persName> who appeared ill and very tired.</p>
<p>7. I said I thought Viet Minh now that they were well installed were showing stern attitude in application Communist doctrine and cited Peoples Court trials, including recent one Hanoi. <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> replied that “well installed” was too strong a term and that Viet Minh were still having trouble getting installed. He added, however, that once in possession of Haiphong and the coast, they would feel more secure and would supply more pressure in communization.</p>
<p>8. He believed that not only would fifth month rice harvest be bad because of insufficient rain during growing season, but that results secondary cultivation, despite good sweet potato and maize crops, would not suffice make up shortage.</p>
<p>9. When <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> mentioned <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> provisional government of 1945, I took occasion say I had heard rumor (<gloss target="#t_Contel1">Contel</gloss> 1303 sent Department May 16, repeated Saigon 1451, Paris 435<note n="2" xml:id="d191fn2">In this telegram dated May 15, the Consulate reported learning from a “Catholic source” that Nguyen Manh Ha, a Catholic layman and Minister of Economy in the Provisional Government of 1945, had visited Hanoi from Paris at the apparent request of <persName corresp="#p_PVD1">Pham Van Dong</persName> to consult on what the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> regarded as the “Catholic problem.” The source believed Ha to be at best a “meddler” and at worst a “peddler” of coexistence, and believed also that the <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> Mission was involved in the arrangement of the visit. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/5–1555)</note>) that Catholic member that government had recently visited Hanoi. <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> recalled that he had heard some such visit had taken place prior his return, but declined to be drawn out this subject.</p>
<p>10. Said he would return to France for consultation during first ten days June. Remarked that he was surprised US had not closed Consulate here. Predicted that operating conditions would become worse after <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> transfer to Saigon and jokingly remarked that <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> mission might leave before Consulate. In discussing various itineraries Hanoi–Paris, he half-jokingly remarked that he could not go via Honolulu and US because “your government would not give me visa”. I replied that I did not think he would have any trouble getting transit visa. Still semi-humorously, he offered to bet me that he would have trouble.</p>

<head>192. Editorial Note</head>
<p>At the 249th meeting of the National Security Council on May 19, according to the memorandum of discussion by <persName corresp="#p_GSE1">Gleason</persName>, May 20, <pb xml:id="pg_415" n="415" facs="0445"/><persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> briefed the Council on his recent trip to Paris and Vienna. The following excerpt is that portion of the report which deals with Vietnam:</p>
<p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ second subject was his talks on Vietnam. These had been conducted directly with the French Premier, <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName>, and had been of very great significance. <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> had started out with a statement that the French did not desire to become involved with serious differences with the United States on the issue of policy in South Vietnam, and accordingly, it was perhaps best for the French to withdraw entirely from this area, surrendering all their responsibilities to the United States. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> countered promptly by suggesting that the U.S. likewise did not want a falling-out with France on this issue, and accordingly, perhaps it would be best if the U.S. itself pulled out of Vietnam. This exchange, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, put an end once and for all to any more such dramatic gestures.</p>
<p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> expressed the view that the French were likely to continue to phase out their expeditionary forces from Vietnam. They would not pause when they reached the level of 75,000 men, as originally planned, but would continue to evacuate their forces until they reached perhaps the level of 50,000. At this point they would stabilize. The French were also planning to move most of their troops from the Saigon area to Cap Saint Jacques, though Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> personally believed that it would be better if the troops from Saigon were sent to guard duty along the 17th parallel. Such a move, however, he thought unlikely.</p>
<p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> inquired of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> whether the latter thought that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would prove strong enough to maintain control of the situation in South Vietnam. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that it seemed likely at the present time. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had just survived a very great crisis. He had demonstrated a local strength in Vietnam that many people had hitherto doubted he possessed. In the recent fighting both of the religious sects, the <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> and the Hoa Hao, had remained neutral, and <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s effort to remove control of the army from <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had utterly failed. On the other hand, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had not yet proved able or willing to form a coalition government. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he had had quite a battle with the French on this issue, because they were so keen for such a coalition. He had argued with them that a coalition government as understood in the West was virtually impossible in this part of the world. In the Orient it was necessary to work through a single head of government rather than through a coalition in which various personal interests had to be submerged in a common loyalty. In illustration of this point, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had cited <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Singhman</persName> <persName corresp="#p_RS1">[<hi rend="italic">Syngman</hi>] Rhee</persName> in Korea and <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> in Indochina itself. Accordingly, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had <pb xml:id="pg_416" n="416" facs="0446"/>argued with the French against any effort to force these theories of a coalition on an unwilling <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. To make matters worse, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> believed that one of the chief reasons for the French desire to establish a coalition government was the possibility that this would afford them the opportunity to bring into such a government some of their own stooges. At any rate, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said, the French Government leaders in Paris seem willing at long last to get aboard the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> bandwagon.</p>
<p>“While there was still much bitterness in Saigon against the United States, the prospects for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> were definitely better, and the high-level Frenchmen were now more disposed to back him. In conclusion on this point, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> indicated that the French had kept urging us to take steps to make <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> do what we felt was necessary and desirable. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had replied that such a course was impossible for us, and that if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> were the kind of man who would do our bidding in this way, he would not be the kind of man who could do what was required to save the situation in Vietnam.” (<persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Library, Whitman File, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Records)</p>

<p>5140. 1. Re Saigon’s 5325 repeated Paris 1370<note n="2" xml:id="d193fn2">In this telegram, May 17, <persName corresp="#p_KRA1">Kidder</persName> relayed <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s bitter complaints that he was being left in the dark as to what had transpired during the Paris tripartite talks, particularly concerning the U.S. position on <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.)</note> and <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 5107 to Saigon repeated Paris 4104.<note n="3" xml:id="d193fn3">In this telegram, May 17, the Department informed the Embassy in Saigon that U.S. officials in Paris had briefed the Vietnamese High Commissioner and <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Ngo Dinh Luyen</persName> and that Department officials in Washington had given the Vietnamese Ambassador an account of the Paris talks. The information, however, was mostly a summary of what had already been reported in Paris newspapers. (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.)</note></p>
<p>You may inform <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> US position during Paris talks along following lines, in addition to reaffirming points you have already made: there must be full recognition nationalist spirit aroused in Vietnam and Vietnamese Government is now an independent force. Support for that force provides best available hope of a moderate constructive anti-Communist evolution. Future of Vietnam depends on having a nationalist government which is not subservient to foreign <pb xml:id="pg_417" n="417" facs="0447"/>demands but which will be receptive to proper suggestions and assistance from those it believes are really interested in its survival and progress. The relationship with Vietnam can be built only on a spirit of mutual trust and confidence. In this context of Secretary’s presentation, principal issue in Paris was complete and sincere support for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government. Throughout all meetings with French officials in Paris US expressed firm policy continued sincere support for legal government under <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. French authorities came around to similar policy in private talks as well as public statements. As to other aspects of talks, you may give <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> the following account with explanation that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> will discuss the talks with him in detail in light of his conversation with Secretary Tuesday May 17<note n="4" xml:id="d193fn4">No report on this discussion has been found, although, according to telegram 5053 to Saigon, May 13, <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> was to meet <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> on May 17 to receive a personal account of the Paris tripartite talks on Vietnam and to benefit from the Secretary’s last-minute view of the situation there. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 120.1551G/5–1355)</note> before departure for Saigon:</p>
<list>
<item>a) A better understanding has been reached between the French and the US re the differences between our respective viewpoints. A sounder possibility has been opened up for useful unilateral action by each government in their efforts to help the Vietnamese Government and people maintain their independence.</item>
<item>b) In public and private statements French authorities renewed their intention to support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and his government. If fully carried out, this could be of great importance.</item>
<item>c) It should be made clear to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> there is no formal agreement or accord between France and US calling for joint US-French action of any kind. Instead it is understood between us that we each will instruct our respective representatives in our own words within the general understanding of support for the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government. We do not believe such accords are proper when a sovereign third party is involved, or which might limit US freedom of action.</item>
<item>d) Re <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, our position is that, pending an expression of the will of the Vietnamese, the thread of legitimacy provided by a Chief of State should be retained to help guard against possible arbitrary and lawless seizure of power by extremist elements including Communists. In any event it is not for the US by its words or actions to appear to suggest a juridical change regarding Vietnam’s constitutional structure, since that is a matter for the Vietnamese alone. Vietnamese officials presumably have reported to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that no member of the US Delegation in Paris made any contact with <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> or any member of his entourage.</item>
<item>e) We had an exchange of views with the French re our respective attitudes towards desirability of strengthening the Vietnamese Government, the amalgamation of the sects into normal life of Vietnam, the disposition of the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>, question of elections both in Free Vietnam and under Geneva Accord, and “propaganda” concerning the French. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> can take these up in more detail with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in accordance with instructions. In any event you may reassure <pb xml:id="pg_418" n="418" facs="0448"/><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that, in all these matters, no decisions were made inasmuch as the US emphasized the sovereign nature of the Vietnamese Government and the impropriety of the US or France doing more than making suggestions and offering advice.</item>
</list>
<p>2. Re Saigon’s 5249 repeated Paris 1345:<note n="5" xml:id="d193fn5">In this telegram, May 13, <persName corresp="#p_KRA1">Kidder</persName> reported that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> proposed discussions in Saigon among French, American, and British chiefs of mission and representatives of his government on Vietnamese questions. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/5–1355)</note> While we appreciate the reasons for making this proposal, we wish to have the matter fully explored before determining whether or not it would be advisable or helpful for the US to participate on a four-power basis in discussions on Vietnamese questions at this time. In the light of the general understanding of support for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> worked out in Paris, we wonder whether or not a four-power conference would still be a good idea. Therefore we wish you would speak to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> along the following lines:</p>
<list>
<item>a) In view of the reaffirmed French declaration of support for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s government, does he still wish to proceed with his invitation for a four-power conference in Saigon? What subjects would be discussed? When would the conference take place? What does he expect such a conference to lead to? What result does he want out of it? What might be its actual consequences?</item>
<item>b) There is an important question of whether or not such a conference coming at this time would have a limiting effect on the freedom of action of both Vietnam and the US. The US, having established the principle of our flexibility and freedom of action during the recent talks, would be disinclined to engage in a conference in Saigon which might restrict our independent action by reason of multilateral understandings.</item>
<item>c) If there are particular subjects of major importance which Vietnam wishes to take up with the French or the US, perhaps it would be better to do so on a bilateral rather than multilateral basis.</item>
<item>d) There is also the question of the level of such a conference. The Secretary’s schedule in the immediate weeks would not permit him to attend. Therefore a representative from US at ministerial level might be difficult to arrange. Exactly what level does <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> have in mind?</item>

<p>5080. Foreign Office (<persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName>) called meeting United States–United Kingdom Embassy representatives this morning (Minister Associated States representative present) to initiate discussion question all-Vietnamese elections. <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> began by saying that he thought on basis views already expressed by United States (he referred to paper left by <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName><note n="2" xml:id="d194fn2">The text of the U.S. position paper, May 5, was attached to a memorandum of conversation by <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName>, May 13.

<p><persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> expressed thought that views United States–United Kingdom–France on this score could perhaps be presented Vietnamese Government most effectively within framework proposed four-power conference Saigon if held in time.

<p>As regards level representation proposed Saigon conference, we said we had gotten impression from Vietnamese official sources Paris that Vietnamese Government thinking in terms level above that of permanent representatives Saigon and preferably at or near Foreign Minister level (<gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 5035<note n="4" xml:id="d194fn4">Dated May 18, not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/5–1855)</note>). <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> indicated tentative French thinking as favoring permanent representative level although he made clear this not final. <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> cautioned, however, that if conference at Foreign Minister level and held so close date consultations scheduled to begin, there might be tendency on part certain countries to interpret conference as designed to concert allied views toward a modification of Geneva Accords. Secondly since San Francisco conference<note n="5" xml:id="d194fn5">The reference is to the ceremonies planned for June 23–27, marking the tenth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations.</note> <pb xml:id="pg_420" n="420" facs="0450"/>would make it impossible for Foreign Ministers to meet Saigon before end June, if by then, conference at level permanent representatives Saigon would appear offer best possibility for holding of conference by early June. We stated Department considering question level representatives. British expressed no firm views this score.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> stated that immediate and most pressing question was who should take initiative to bring South Vietnamese Government and Viet Minh together by July 20 to begin pre-electoral consultations, noting the importance of not delaying and giving Viet Minh opportunity seize initiative, or arriving at July 20 with question still undecided. <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> said French considered there two possibilities: Call on two presidents Geneva Conference or on <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> to make approach to two parties. He indicated French thought former course preferable and most logical. United Kingdom representative concurred subject approval London. <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> continued saying that if four-power conference Saigon held in time, United Kingdom, for example, might propose that conference call on two presidents Geneva Conference take initiative to approach two parties. In approaching two parties with view bringing them together, <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> said Geneva Conference presidents should perhaps suggest a possible site for talks as well as pose question as to level representation two parties desired have participate talks. Regarding possible site, the thought was generally expressed that a location in demilitarized zone would perhaps have best chance acceptance by two sides. <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> concluded saying that Geneva Conference presidents would solely endeavor bring two parties together leaving to latter discussion fundamental aspects problem of elections.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> suggested finally that United States and United Kingdom Embassy representatives continue to meet with French to concert views on objectives arid modalities all-Vietnamese elections which could then be presented to Vietnamese Government for its consideration in course four-power conference. It was generally agreed that in any event Vietnamese Government would be kept informed developments tripartite thinking on all-Vietnamese elections regardless four-power conference timetable. This connection, <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> stated that French views on fundamental aspects all-Vietnamese elections appeared to parallel substantially views expressed in paper this subject handed him by <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName>. We presume Department has no objection our giving copy latter paper to United Kingdom Embassy.</p>
<p>Question possible Australian request for participation in four-power conference Saigon raised, but <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> pointed out that this fundamentally question for Vietnamese Government since it inviting power and, in any event, it should not be difficult to agree on formula to keep Australian representative Saigon fully informed. It was <pb xml:id="pg_421" n="421" facs="0451"/>generally agreed that inclusion Australia would perhaps open door additional demands for participation.</p>
<p>We said we would convey general lines French thinking this score to Department. <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> said he would send to United States and United Kingdom Embassies written outline points raised in course meeting to facilitate consideration by United States and United Kingdom Governments with view to development common position.

<p>1. <gloss target="#t_reftel1">Reftel</gloss>s indicate <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has at least tentatively adopted position Free Vietnam may refuse consult Viet Minh during July 1955 as called for Geneva Accord but may intend delay such consultation until formation national assembly sometime after August 1955. Thus, difficulty may arise in our giving our views along lines of Vietnamese participating pre-election conversation if such advice would either have no effect or would cause <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> believe US joining in a ganging up operation against him with France and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.</p>
<p>2. Nevertheless you should talk to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in general terms about matter of Geneva elections soonest. Regarding actual course of action to be followed during consultations, assuming they are held, we will be glad give <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> our views. (These are contained in next following telegram.<note n="4" xml:id="d195fn4">Telegram 5267, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</note>) He should understand these are simply US views based upon our experience with election problems involving the Communists in Korea and Germany. Basically we believe that in order to put Free Vietnam in strongest position it should take initiative on free elections and insist on rigid guarantees by Communists for genuinely free elections. Our experience in Germany and Korea has been that such guarantees are unacceptable to the Communists and that as a <pb xml:id="pg_422" n="422" facs="0452"/>result negotiations have either broken down or been extended, in the case of Germany over ten years. Remind <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> of Secretary’s conversations in March on this subject when Secretary stated freedom elections cannot be assured unless there adequate official supervision, freedom from threats before during elections and assurances against reprisals afterward.</p>
<p>3. Indicate while he may believe correct refer question to national assembly we concerned about reaction various powers this delay. Wonder if he has fully considered seriously complicating disadvantages of what amounts to flat rejection of Geneva agreement provisions. We do not wish become involved in offering direct recommendations regarding ways and means of the two sides meeting for pre-election consultation until we know more about <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s thinking. However mention that in any projected delay or rejection of pre-election consultation Free Vietnam will almost inevitably expose itself to intervention by the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and possible action by the two co-chairmen of the Geneva Powers or a reconvocation of the Geneva Powers. Even if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s reported intention to refer decision to assembly is a politically valid one, we feel delay may nevertheless bring about above intervention. Also rejection will leave initiative elections with Viet Minh.</p>

<p>Use text of Department telegram 4362<note n="2" xml:id="d196fn2"><ref target="#d102">Document 102</ref>.</note> to Saigon with following changes:</p>
<p>New paragraph one: Same text as paragraph one Department telegram except delete last sentence. Paragraph two: Insert following as new paragraph two: “The United States believes that Free Vietnam <pb xml:id="pg_423" n="423" facs="0453"/>and the Viet Minh should be the only principal parties in the negotiations. The United States believes that the International Supervisory Commission should not play a prominent role in the electoral discussions. It is important that the Free Vietnamese Government be in a position to make political capital from strong advocacy of unification through genuinely free elections. It is also important that the Communists clearly bear the onus for any refusal to agree to conditions which would guarantee genuinely free elections or for any obstruction of the preliminary talks. If the International Supervisory Commission is active in the discussions its activity might tend to diffuse the political advantages which Free Vietnam might otherwise gain from the negotiations and at the same time provide the Communists with the means for avoiding full responsibility for any negative attitudes which they may adopt. The United States believes that it would be unwise to entrust any important part of the task of devising the conditions or objectives of elections in Vietnam to a commission composed of members having such conflicting views. The United States would not expect Free Vietnam to be willing to delegate such authority to such a commission.”</p>
<p>New paragraph three same as old paragraph two. New paragraph four same as old paragraph three. New paragraph five insert the following: “If the negotiations proceed past the point of discussion of conditions for free elections to the questions of the mechanics and objectives of an election, the United States believes that Free Vietnam should negotiate for principles which would protect it from fraudulent Communist takeover. The United States believes that these principles should be generally consistent with the principles which the Western Powers are advocating with respect to Germany and Korea. The United States also believes that the Free Vietnamese should take the position that elections should aim at setting up a joint constituent assembly whose sole task would be to draft a constitution for the whole country. The United States believes that pending adoption of the constitution such an assembly should have no governmental powers and that both Communist and Free Vietnam should remain under the administration of the existing governments in each zone.”</p>

<p>Dear Ken: I refer to Dept Circular Telegram 653 of May 10,<note n="2" xml:id="d197fn2">Not printed. (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.)</note> a joint State–<gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> message, requesting that Embassy and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> participate in the preparation of the MCA [<hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_MDA1">MDA</gloss></hi>?] Program for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957.</p>
<p>The base paper<note n="3" xml:id="d197fn3">Titled “Development of a Force Basis for a Timed-Phased <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 57 Mutual Defense Assistance Program for Indochina,” dated May 23, not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> <gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss> 2854)</note> was prepared by <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> in compliance with its instructions and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and ourselves made the requested contribution which is included as Appendix IX of the document. The complete submission went to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> in four copies.</p>
<p>I believe no useful purpose would be served by our having the very lengthy document recopied and sent to the Department as it is primarily a <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> matter and <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> would want to add its comments for any submission to Washington. I should like however to point out that Embassy and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> were obliged to dissent from Iron Mike’s point of view.<note n="4" xml:id="d197fn4"><p>In Appendix IX to the document cited in <ref target="#d197fn3">footnote 3</ref> above, the Embassy and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> recommended adhering to the ultimate goal of a Vietnam armed force of 100,000 as had been advocated by <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>. The phased reduction to this goal was to be achieved by early 1956.</p>
<p>“Iron Mike” was the nickname of <persName corresp="#p_OD1">Lieutenant General John W. O’Daniel</persName>.</p></note> He has projected for <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 55 and 56 a total of 150,000 men divided into four field divisions and six light divisions. For <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 57 and for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 58 and 59 he has estimated that a troop basis for Vietnam of 125,000 will be required.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mike</persName> bases his position on a number of factors, all except one of which were recognized and taken into consideration when the original <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> estimate of 100,000 was accepted. The one new factor, and from a realistic point of view an extremely important one, is the continuing state of insecurity in the country which has made it necessary to either stop or slow down the rate of demobilization. No propaganda background for the demobilization program has been laid and the program is way behind schedule. That, as well as the problem of added integrees from the sects, was recognized when Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> requested an additional forty million dollars. We are up against a major problem in pushing demobilization, but I do not believe we have any alternative other than to stretch out the demobilization period and perhaps put off the program for conscription for perhaps a year. The latter program will be most difficult to organize until the census about to be commenced in connection with elections <pb xml:id="pg_425" n="425" facs="0455"/>has been completed. <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> does not envisage this conscription program being implemented up to the 30,000 figure until the close of the calendar year 1958—the added cost involved in this slowdown would be substantial.</p>
<p>A major factor which I do not believe <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> fully appreciates which mitigates against their estimated requirements is the economic one. This is the subject of the following paragraph taken from the Embassy–<gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> comments, Paragraph d:</p>
<list>
<item>“d. Wholly apart from the question of Vietnam’s ability to finance its armed forces, considerable difficulty has been experienced in such financing through U.S. aid. This aid is granted in dollars but is used principally to finance piaster expenditures within Vietnam. This means that unless goods are imported equivalent to the dollar aid, its conversion into piasters is perforce inflationary, irrespective of the mechanics used. For a variety of reasons, some political, some institutional, there seems to be serious doubt that imports can be maintained at a level comparable to aid requirements already posited for the military. Already there has been built up potential inflation by the creation of piasters for military expenditures. <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and the Embassy believe that any material increase of this potential inflation would create a dangerous situation which could vitiate all of our programs in Vietnam if it became rampant. It is of the utmost importance, therefore, that everything be done to avoid increasing the amount of dollar aid over and above the amounts required to maintain the armed forces at the 100,000 man level originally planned.”</item>
</list>
<p>I believe <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mike</persName>’s basic feeling on the subject of force levels is well expressed in the comment which he added at the end of the Embassy–<gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> position paper: “I feel that primary emphasis now should be placed on the number of troops that are needed to do the job, keeping in mind the basic plan for long term reduction gaged upon national progress.” Personally I just do not see where the money is going to come from to support his force level, nor do I see how we would be able to pump it into Vietnam, if it were available, without the attendant danger of severe inflation.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Fred Reinhardt</persName> arrived a few days ago and is already deep in background papers and in getting his feet on the ground. We pushed his schedule for presentation of credentials in order that he might be able to attend the various functions being given in honor of <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> previous to his departure. Those dinners and receptions gave him an excellent opportunity to meet most of the leading characters on the present scene without delay. We are all delighted to have him here and hope that we will be able to back stop him properly.</p>
<p>With all best wishes.</p>

<p>p.s. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ views on the subject of forces basis was set out in Top Secret Despatch 393 of May 11 on “Problem of Combatting Communist Subversion in South Vietnam.”<note n="6" xml:id="d197fn6">In this despatch, signed by <persName corresp="#p_KRA1">Kidder</persName> as Chargé, the Embassy stated in part: “Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ views remain those he expressed while in Washington 22–28 April, i.e. a reduction in the strength of the Vietnamese Armed Forces as early as practicable is desirable. The force structure as originally planned, when properly trained and led, would be adequate for performing the missions of maintaining internal security and providing a blocking force in event of external aggression while awaiting action by the Manila Pact Powers. However, the crisis created by the sects has required the suspension of planned force reduction. In addition, the Government has integrated into the Army certain sect units for political reasons. These developments have increased rather than reduced the size and costs of the armed forces this calendar year. Nevertheless, when and if the sect crisis is resolved, whether by forceful or political measures, forces above 100,000 would not be required. Implementation of the planned force reductions should resume promptly so as to minimize the costs borne by the US, and to hold within bounds the magnitude of US dollar funds injected into Vietnam which, under present programs, approach the upper limit that can be absorbed without adverse inflationary consequences.” (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.5/5–1155)</note></p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>. . . Message to Saigon on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s Policies</item>
</list>
<p>I checked this morning again . . . on whether a reply had yet come in to our message of Friday<note n="2" xml:id="d198fn2">Concerning the response to this message, see <ref target="#d201">Document 201</ref>.</note> pursuant to a request made by the Secretary and by you. . . . told me that he had checked this morning and (a) to the best of his knowledge no reply has yet come in; (b) he asked his people to send out a needler to get a reply back in a hurry; and (c) he suggested that I send up to you . . . from Saigon which is attached.<note n="3" xml:id="d198fn3">Not attached to the source text.</note></p>
<p>This . . . has a source comment which is optimistic. Of course this is not a fully evaluated report and represents only <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName>’s opinion. However, we have received nothing from the Embassy during the past two weeks to indicate the Embassy is particularly <pb xml:id="pg_427" n="427" facs="0457"/>disturbed or anxious over developments. Last week we asked the Embassy to prepare a situation report for <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> and the Department. The Embassy replied that it had done so but since there were no new factors it would pouch the report<note n="4" xml:id="d198fn4">In despatch 420, May 25. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/5–2555)</note> rather than send it in telegraphic form. However we did ask them to telegraph in the section on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s capabilities and the Hoa Hao problem. So far we have had no reply.<note n="5" xml:id="d198fn5">See <ref target="#d200">Document 200</ref>.</note></p>
<p>Judging by all of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> reports of the past week, my conversations with <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> experts on Viet-Nam, and a pretty thorough canvass of the situation with <persName corresp="#p_HRE1">Bob Hoey</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KPM1">Paul Kattenburg</persName> last Friday and again this week, there does not seem to be any evidence available in Washington at this time to indicate <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has “bitten off more than he can chew”. Of course he is being set upon by rebellious elements despite an effort on the part of the Vietnamese Government to seek a negotiation of the differences by peaceful bargaining and show of strength rather than by the test of arms. I think the real difficulty in the situation is that the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government and its enemies are diverting their energies from coming to grips with the real adversary of Free Viet-Nam—the Viet Minh.</p>
<p>Recent reports from Saigon including a field trip of <persName corresp="#p_LW1">Ladejinsky</persName><note n="6" xml:id="d198fn6"><persName corresp="#p_LW1">Wolf I. Ladejinsky</persName>, Land Reform Adviser at the U.S. Operations Mission in Vietnam.</note> again demonstrate the absence of political, administrative and military backing throughout the countryside. Until the national government establishes its authority with officials and security forces at the provincial and village level, Free Viet-Nam is more an expression of desire than the establishment of a fact. A great deal of time has been lost unhappily in the past six months in diversionary struggles with real and inevitable enemies such as the Binh Xuyen and French intrigues. I think it is also necessary to continue this course of action to get control of the Hoa Hao. I feel it would be a mistake to discourage the government in this project. In fact the Vietnamese Government should have support even with aircraft, ammunition and possibly operational advice. This may be a radical suggestion but once on a course I like to see it carried through.</p>

<p>Dear Freddie: By the time this reaches you Saigon’s newness will have worn off, I presume, and your mission will be well on its way.<note n="2" xml:id="d199fn2"><persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> presented his credentials on May 28.</note> There are several things I would like to jot down. The Vietnamese hot flame has simmered a bit. Of course it may flash back at any moment but fortunately this quiet time has given us a little chance to reflect on various matters.</p>
<p>1. <hi rend="italic">The <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>:</hi> It seems to me we ought to have a somewhat more definite attitude as to what we want the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> to do, if anything. My own view is we should quietly encourage the gradual and steady reduction of the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> down to a division or corps level to be stationed near the 17th Parallel, for a few months or perhaps pulled out entirely, with naval and air units possibly remaining on. I don’t see the value of the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> even as a deterrent. It is not so much the size of the force as the legal and political relationships that may bother us, unless the Viet Minh reopens hostilities. How long will the Vietnamese tolerate a Frenchman as Commander in Chief? Is there anything in <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Ngo Dinh Luyen</persName>’s idea that Vietnamese and French forces should not be operated from one command but rather placed under some Manila Pact organization? I feel a good deal of sympathy for the Vietnamese views that the command structure, the size and location of French forces, the over-all security of Viet-Nam, and the issue of elections are closely interrelated. I would certainly appreciate your reactions and impressions in this matter when you feel free to give them. It may be a good idea for you to send a summary of your views in a telegram, particularly on the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>. I have recommended to <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Walter Robertson</persName> that we take this up with the Defense Department and the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> pretty soon.</p>
<p>2. <hi rend="italic">1956 Elections:</hi> <persName corresp="#p_HRE1">Bob Hoey</persName> and I feel we are running into stormy weather. The Vietnamese may become more and more allergic to talking with the Viet Minh in July or thereafter. They may fear this ipso facto acceptance of the Geneva Accord and of the Viet Minh. We foresee a lot of trouble here if the Vietnamese are stubborn in the Korean fashion. I personally have a lot of sympathy for their position and hope we will not twist their arm to talk with the Communists. On the other hand their refusal will become an international issue which might be most untimely this summer whether at the <pb xml:id="pg_429" n="429" facs="0459"/>summit, on the slopes or particularly down in the foothills. A policy of discretion is probably better than an attitude of outright defiance but we may have some real diplomatic problems here.</p>
<p>You may find that your counsel of caution and circumspection will not convince <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> he should indicate a willingness to open talks with the Viet Minh on July 20. This problem could become a highly inflamed public issue in Free Viet-Nam if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, his colleagues, the Revolutionary Committee and others begin to seize on it. It might even replace the anti-<persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, anti-French theme with a great deal more effect if based on the idea genuine nationalism cannot compromise with communism in any way, shape or form. This of course would put us in a very difficult position. I think the heart of the matter would be that American public opinion would not easily support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> if he were the obvious cause of the breakdown in the whole election problem, and if the Viet Minh threatened to intervene or caused uprisings in the South, or even moved across the 17th Parallel. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s refusal to talk could result in his isolation; it would all depend on how much support he had in Free Viet-Nam. As indicated in the following paragraph, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and the Vietnamese Government are not strongly organized throughout Free Viet-Nam, which worries us very much. Accordingly, at some point we may have to speak fairly strongly to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to the effect that he cannot count on us for assistance if he is the principal reason for a breakdown on the election issue resulting in a possible Viet Minh military action of some sort. We have not come to this point but it may be taken up in connection with the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper on elections which is up for consideration on June 9. I am merely mentioning this matter by way of anticipation and this is purely informal.</p>
<p>3. <hi rend="italic">Free Vietnamese Elections:</hi> In a recent telegram [title deleted] asked the Embassy for ideas on a decree for a National Assembly. The Embassy in turn asked us for advice.<note n="3" xml:id="d199fn3">In telegram 5452 from Saigon, May 24. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/5–2455)</note> Perhaps the best way for us to go about this is to engage the services of an American constitutional expert or political scientist who could go out to Saigon for a month or two. The trouble is we are so short-handed here we don’t have time to really study the matter even if we had the knowledge and background. In this connection I hope we can get <persName corresp="#p_KPM1">Paul Kattenburg</persName> out in the next two weeks.</p>
<p>4. <hi rend="italic">Control in Free Viet-Nam:</hi> I am really troubled by the lack of control and authority throughout Free Viet-Nam. This is reflected in <persName corresp="#p_LW1">Ladejinsky</persName>’s reports and in Embassy despatches and telegrams. I hope you will have a chance to talk at length with <persName corresp="#p_LW1">Wolf</persName>. He is a wonderfully perceptive and reliable observer. He is far more than an agricultural <pb xml:id="pg_430" n="430" facs="0460"/>expert and I commend him to you most highly. If there are any additional measures we should take or urge the Vietnamese Government to take to reestablish its authority and administrative apparatus to fill the vacuum in the countryside please let us know.</p>
<p>5. <hi rend="italic">Force Levels for Viet-Nam:</hi> We were impressed by the excellent job done by <persName corresp="#p_MKJA1">McKesson</persName> in Despatch No. 358.<note n="4" xml:id="d199fn4">In this despatch from Saigon, April 28, <persName corresp="#p_MKJA1">John A. McKesson</persName>, Second Secretary and Consul at Saigon, coordinated a 32-page country-team enclosure entitled “Problem of Combatting Communist Subversion in South Vietnam”, in response to an instruction by the Department of State to provide information to the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> in its formulation of policy toward U.S. assistance to security forces in countries threatened by “communist subversion”. The gist of the report was that the threat of subversion in South Vietnam was of major proportions and likely to increase in the coming months. To combat this danger, the country team recommended delay of the schedule for demobilization of the <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss>; emphasis on police training in the army; strengthening of those parts of the Vietnamese civil administration dealing with internal security, law enforcement, and local government; and continuation of the USIS propaganda campaign in South Vietnam. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.5/4–2855)</note> The recommendation that the force goal of the national army be 150,000 was contradicted by <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ comments in Despatch No. 393<note n="5" xml:id="d199fn5">Dated May 11, not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.5/5–1155)</note> which we received today. He holds to the figure of 100,000. This will have to be worked out on the ground, since the Pentagon will not originate a study but will only comment on or approve a figure submitted by <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>. I suggest you ask <persName corresp="#p_OD1">O’Daniel</persName> to institute a recommendation through <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CNO1">CNO</gloss>, based on Despatch 358 and commenting on 393, for consideration by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. I would appreciate your comments to the Department on this matter, parallel to the communication from <persName corresp="#p_OD1">O’Daniel</persName> to the Department of Defense.<note n="6" xml:id="d199fn6">See <ref target="#d208">Documents 208</ref> and <ref target="#d215">215</ref>.</note></p>
<p>6. <hi rend="italic">Reports:</hi> We received a mountain of telegrams during the <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> mission many of which were in effect memoranda of conversation. The interest in Viet-Nam is so extensive here in Washington and the stakes are so high that I have been wondering about some adequate form of periodic evaluations or situation reports. The Weeka does not meet this. Perhaps it could be recast but I think a telegraphic weekly review of the situation with evaluation would be helpful. In this connection, there may be a discussion of Viet-Nam at San Francisco between the Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName>, so we should like to have your summary of the situation on or about mid-June, but we are telegraphing you about this.</p>
<p>7. <hi rend="italic">Personnel:</hi> We are certainly short-handed here and in Saigon for good political officers. We need another officer here on Viet-Nam, if we could find one. I am now wondering about the desirability of pulling <persName corresp="#p_CTJ1">Corcoran</persName> out of Hanoi and putting him in the Political Section as Acting Chief until <persName corresp="#p_MKDH1">McKillop</persName> arrives, then we could bring Frank Meloy back here in late summer or early fall. <persName corresp="#p_CTJ1">Corcoran</persName> would <pb xml:id="pg_431" n="431" facs="0461"/>greatly strengthen the Embassy and I hate to see his talents unused in Hanoi although he is doing a splendid job there. If you think <persName>Frank</persName> should be considered for work on Viet-Nam here in <gloss target="#t_PSA1">PSA</gloss>, would you ask him whether he would be interested and also ask him to let me know before this proceeds too far.</p>
<p>I think that is everything for the moment. I hope you don’t mind my sending you all the above, but several of the things in the first five paragraphs are difficult to handle telegraphically. Please let me know whenever I can be of help to your mission. Very best wishes.</p>

<p>5609. Re <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> sent Saigon 5271.<note n="2" xml:id="d200fn2">In this telegram, May 27, the Department of State requested from the Embassy a current assessment of the situation in Vietnam and of the Hoa Hao dissident capabilities. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/5–2555)</note></p>
<p>1. Following is revised summary our analysis <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s position and future policies. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s major effort since taking office has been directed at solidifying government’s position as supreme authority. All other aims and programs have been retarded and subordinated to attainment major goal. Secondary and more recent effort, which to some extent aimed at same goal, is establishment new base of legality for government. Fruition this effort designed to be national elections and a National Assembly which would give new constitutional base for government.</p>
<p>2. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s policy would appear to be moving into final phase of subduing organized opposition and at same time into first phase of preparing way for national political action. Having gained support of army, and being in mop-up stages of action against Binh Xuyen (who cannot, however, be entirely discounted), he is ready to move militarily against Hoa Hao. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> probably believes success against <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> will permit isolation of <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> and render ineffective such groups as Dai Viet, which Palace seems to believe represent past era. It seems clear <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has no intention broaden his government by including other national figures or elements prior formation <pb xml:id="pg_432" n="432" facs="0462"/>national assembly which he probably anticipates being able to control. Political action of “Revolutionary Committee” and exploratory efforts set up electoral system are clear signs preparation for stage two. Latest evidence indicates <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> may have determined deal with <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> question prior convening National Assembly, and possibility exists government may resort to early “referendum” to provide basis for removal <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> as Chief of State.</p>
<p>3. Following is . . . estimate of Hoa Hao capabilities: current strength Hoa Hao around 16,000 armed personnel, broken down as follows: <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> 7,000; <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName> 3,000; <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> 3,000; and <persName>Nguyen</persName> 3,000. (Figures claimed are greatly in excess of these.) <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> considered loyal to government. <persName>Nguyen</persName> officially rallied on June 1 and <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> has agreed “integrate” 3,000 his troops. <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName> believed ready actively to oppose government military action. Hoa Hao forces considered 30 to 40 percent combat effective compared to <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss>, owing to known equipment shortages and logistic deficiencies. Possibility French resupply Hoa Hao forces discounted. <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> has 21,000 troops deployed in Can Tho, Soc Trang and Vin Long subdivisions.</p>
<p>4. If <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> successful in trapping <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> and preventing his movement westward to <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName> area, <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> should be able to reduce <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> forces to 3,000 to 5,000 men in short order. If <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> trapped and succeeds in break-out to join <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName> a force of 5,000 to 7,000 would remain which <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> in open battle should be able to reduce in two to three weeks to a residual force of 2,000 to 3,000 men with little or no ammunition. Should Hoa Hao avoid any large scale engagement and resort to maquis type guerilla action, they could probably maintain considerable strength for longer period. Third phase of <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> campaign against Hoa Hao would be a three month “starve out” action which would probably reduce Hoa Hao capabilities to traditional small banditry.</p>

<item>Current Situation in South Vietnam</item>
</list>
<pb xml:id="pg_433" n="433" facs="0463"/>
<p>In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>’s request,<note n="2" xml:id="d201fn2">See <ref target="#d198">Document 198</ref>.</note> the following are the comments of . . . on the current situation in South Vietnam, with particular reference to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s current capabilities to deal with dissident elements:</p>
<list>
<item>“1. Premier <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is believed capable of handling the problems he has chosen to attack at this time. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s Government must take a strong stand to solidify its position. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is more aware of the need for sure success than anyone else in Vietnam and he is therefore being most careful to stack every military and political card in his favor first. Lack of popular support behind his present enemies facilitates his actions.</item>
<item>“2. According to [name and title deleted], negotiations were completed on 2 June for the integration of 3,000 of <persName corresp="#p_LTNG1">Lam Thanh Nguyen</persName>’s troops into the Vietnamese National Army. This follows a long held government plan to keep its enemies split into small groups.</item>
<item>“3. There is every evidence that the planned military operation against <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Tran Van Soai</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName> is extremely well laid out and well developed logistically. Barring unforeseen major mistakes, there is every reason to believe that it will be successful if it is needed.</item>
<item>“4. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has shown to <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Colonel Lansdale</persName> the plans for military moves against <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName>, if such steps are necessary. . . . <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> assigned a liaison officer with <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> when <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Colonel Lansdale</persName> pointed out the favorable conditions for political negotiations with <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> from a <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> position of strength. It is possible that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is similar to most Asians and entered into political negotiations primarily to gain time in order to strengthen his military forces against <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName>. However, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> did open the way for proposals from <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> in which he reportedly asked that ‘his duchy concept’ be made legal. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> turned down such a proposal flatly.</item>
<item>“5. On major issues <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has given proof in the past of heeding American advice. We feel certain that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would listen to and thoroughly consider concrete realistic American advice directly from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName>, or through <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Colonel Lansdale</persName>.</item>
<item>“6. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s influence, that of his followers, and that of <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName> have brought the Revolutionary Committee under control of the Government. All moves by extremists to control the Committee have been blocked by the Government’s adroit use of counter moves and balances. As an, example, the demonstration of 15 May could have been made to order for exploitation by extremist or Viet Minh elements, but the whole affair was well-organized and well-controlled. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has no fear of losing this control.</item>
<item>“7. <persName corresp="#p_TVH1">Huu</persName> is technically not under arrest, but is being detained in Vietnam and the Government has taken his passport. According to <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">General Le</persName>, with the full backing of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, was responsible for <persName corresp="#p_TVH1">Huu</persName>’s detention.</item>
<item>“8. The action of the Government in continuing to arrest opposition leaders could lead to increased skepticism, wariness, and concern as to the real intentions of the Government on the part of neutrals and intellectuals who are not at this time opposing the Government, <pb xml:id="pg_434" n="434" facs="0464"/>although they are not supporting it. As yet, however, there is no sign of any real growth of feeling along these lines. Available information indicates that the Dai Viet sentiment will continue to be oppositionist unless the Government accepts the Dai Viets on their terms.”</item>

<p>5643. This morning in first lengthy conversation with <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> since my arrival following emerged:</p>
<p>1. When asked if explanations given him by <persName corresp="#p_KRA1">Kidder</persName> re Paris talks had answered all questions in his mind he replied affirmatively. He added however that some press interpretations had bothered him, particularly those referring to the relative importance of Vietnam within the framework of Franco-American relations, but that he was fully aware and appreciative of the clarity and straightforwardness of the American position.</p>
<p>2. Re situation in southwest <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said negotiations still dragging on but that he felt erosion of Hoa Hao would eventually reduce problem to manageable proportions. He stated integration of 3000 of Hoa Hao force of General <persName>Nguyen</persName> practically assured.</p>
<p>3. On subject of four power conference in Saigon I advanced considerations enumerated in paragraph 2 <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 5265 (rptd Paris 4245 London 6037).<note n="2" xml:id="d202fn2">In this telegram, May 27, the Department of State instructed <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> in his first substantive meeting with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to emphasize that a four-power conference idea to settle Vietnamese problems might diminish U.S. freedom of action to aid South Vietnam. Instead the Department’s advice was for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to first dispose of bilateral problems through direct negotiations with those powers concerned. This would leave the question of elections and negotiations with the North on election procedures. In the Department’s view, this was a proper issue for a four-power meeting. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/5–2355)</note> His attitude confirmed recent reports that he is not pressing for an early meeting yet it is clear that he wishes to use proposal for conference as lever on French to force regularization of <pb xml:id="pg_435" n="435" facs="0465"/>status of <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> in Vietnam as well as to obtain definition of nature of Manila Pact commitment to defense of Vietnam against Viet Minh.</p>
<p>4. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> linked subject of Geneva elections and declaration of Vietnam policy for unification and free elections to question of status <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>. He insisted it was not politically possible for him to run risks involved in any approach to this subject until matter of <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> regularized and his government enjoyed in fact freedom of action within its own territory.</p>
<p>5. Re elections for National Assembly he thought this might be accomplished by about September. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> in earlier conversation however expressed conviction November earliest possible date.</p>
<p>6. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> agreed to our making available to Minister Interior police organization study originally drawn up by Franco-American working groups and recently revised to (1) provide for incorporation gendarméries into National Police, and (2) eliminate subject of advisory groups which could not be agreed with French.</p>
<p>7. Subsequent tel<note n="3" xml:id="d202fn3">Telegram 5677 from Saigon, June 6, not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/6–655)</note> will deal with subject paragraphs 3 and 4 at greater length.</p>
<p>8. In general I was impressed by <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> singleness of purpose and deep suspicion and distrust of French, as well as by his apparent lack of any compunction in tailoring his account of events to support a point.</p>

</list>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion</p>
<p>1. The major points in the draft statement of U.S. policy (pages 1–3) are: (a) the necessity of having a strong Free Viet-Nam for any effective approach on the election problem; (b) the desirability of Free Viet-Nam beginning consultations with the Viet Minh in July, 1955, as provided for in the Geneva Accord (para. 5); (c) the importance of stressing adequate guarantees and supervisory powers to ensure free elections and to put the onus on the Communists for preventing free elections (paras. 6–8); and (d) forceful reaction by the Manila Pact powers, and if necessary by the U.S. alone, if the Communists renew hostilities over the issue of elections (para. 10). The first point, the subject of our entire present effort in Free Viet-Nam, is proceeding with some grounds for hope that Viet-Nam now can be adequately strengthened if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> vigorously executes the whole reform program and consolidates national authority throughout Free Viet-Nam. The other three points may also face considerable difficulties.</p>
<p>2. The question of pre-electoral consultations with the Viet Minh is fast becoming a major political and diplomatic problem because <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and his ministers have tentatively indicated their opposition to opening consultations on July 20, 1955. The French and the Viet Minh are insisting that consultations begin on that day. The Indians and the British will undoubtedly concur. While <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s position has not been finally fixed, our Embassy in Saigon has reported several times that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has three principal concerns:</p>
<list>
<item>a) Free Viet-Nam must dissociate itself completely from the Geneva Accord insofar as elections are concerned. Its position on consultations and elections will be taken not because of the Geneva Accord, which it did not sign, but on grounds of Vietnamese national interests and considerations.</item>
<item>b) Accordingly, Free Viet-Nam cannot even consider the question of consultations and elections until after a National Assembly has been elected and convoked, and has declared its views.</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_437" n="437" facs="0467"/>
<item>c) The status and responsibilities of the French Expeditionary Corps in Viet-Nam must be settled first, so that Free Viet-Nam can have unquestioned and complete sovereignty before adopting any public position on free elections.</item>
</list>
<p>The <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> statement of policy assumes that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would agree to consultations with the Viet Minh in July, 1955, and would agree to take the initiative with respect to the whole matter of free elections regardless of Vietnamese objections to the Geneva Accord and to formal discussions with their enemy, the Viet Minh. The draft statement of policy will remain valid only if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> eventually agrees to some kind of discussions with the Viet Minh. On May 27 we instructed <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> to discuss this whole matter with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> pointing out the disadvantages of opposing talks and losing the initiative. We have not received <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s detailed views or intentions.</p>
<p>If <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> continues to oppose talks with the Viet Minh for the above stated three reasons, the U.S. will soon have to decide whether it should or could compel <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to agree to talks beginning on July 20 rather than wait for the views of the National Assembly some time next fall. It may be that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is deliberately using the election issue to bargain with the French over the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> and possibly with the U.S. over security guarantees for Viet-Nam. If we point out the difficulties for the U.S. in his opposition, particularly in terms of our military support, he may come around. However, he may insist on putting the issue to a National Assembly. This will be hard for us to counter. And the Assembly with widespread support may later oppose any talks with the Viet Minh on elections. Thus, the failure to hold consultations in July and the possible continued failure to meet Communist demands on elections may create a pretext for Communist subversive or overt military action either to frighten the people in South Viet-Nam or to attempt a forceful seizure of power. Politically, however, the initiative would pass to the Communists.</p>
<p>3. Regarding conditions for free elections, the Vietnamese, French, British, Canadians, Indians and others will agree in principle at least initially, although we have not heard formally from them. But, the difficulty to anticipate is the possible attempt of the French, British and Indians to water this position down if the Viet Minh makes seemingly plausible and moderate proposals, as intimated in the Viet Minh statement of June 6. Once consultations with the Viet Minh are started, it is probable Free Viet-Nam and also the United States will be under increasing pressure to accept a compromise with the Viet Minh. Therefore, it may become increasingly difficult to demonstrate, as called for in para. 7 of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper; that the failure to secure free elections is the fault of the Communists.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_438" n="438" facs="0468"/>
<p>4. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> have proposed an amendment of para. 10,<note n="3" xml:id="d203fn3"><p>According to a memorandum from the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> to the Secretary of Defense, May 25, transmitted to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> by <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName> on June 2, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> recommended the following revision of paragraph 10 (the italics represent the additional language recommended by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and the cancelled type the deletions proposed):</p>
<p>“If pursuit of the above policy should result in a renewal of hostilities by the Communists, the U.S., in the light of the general circumstances then prevailing, should be prepared to oppose any Communist attack <hi rend="italic">by immediately invoking the Manila Pact and taking vigorous action thereunder to repel the Communist military aggression</hi>. <del rend="strikethrough">with U.S. armed forces, if necessary and feasible consulting the Congress in advance if the emergency permits preferably in concert with the Manila Pact allies of the U.S., but if necessary alone</del>.” (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_SS1">S/S</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Files: Lot 63 D 351)</p></note> ostensibly to make it clearer that U.S. reaction to possible Communist reopening of hostilities should be taken under the Manila Pact. In fact, however, their proposed amendment deletes the recommendation that, provided Viet-Nam follows the recommended policy, the U.S., if necessary, be prepared to react alone to Communist renewal of hostilities if it proves impossible to gain concerted action from its major allies. We have no quarrel with the idea that action should be taken under the Manila Pact, and the original language was intended to provide that action be taken under the Manila Pact. But we think it important that the Council realize that we may face a situation in which we may not, initially at least, have support from our major allies and that the Council decide whether or not under those circumstances the U.S. should be prepared to act alone. Accordingly we recommend either that the original language be restored, or that the phrase “preferably in concert with the Manila Pact allies of the U.S., but if necessary alone” be added to the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> language.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendations</p>
<p>1. It is recommended that you support the approval of the draft statement of policy, but that you also point out:</p>
<list>
<item>a) Free Viet-Nam’s delay or rejection of consultations with the Viet Minh on July 20 will create real political difficulties and hold up the implementation of this policy;</item>
<item>b) it may be difficult to maneuver the Viet Minh into a position of rejection of the conditions of free elections;</item>
<item>c) in view of the importance to the security of Southeast Asia of preserving Free Viet-Nam, the original language of para. 10 should be retained, or the phrase “preferably in concert with Manila Pact allies of the U.S., but if necessary alone” should be added to the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> language.</item>

</list>
<p>After the Secretary had read the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> draft statement of policy<note n="2" xml:id="d204fn2"><ref target="#d190">Document 190</ref>.</note> and the briefing memorandum,<note n="3" xml:id="d204fn3"><hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note> the following points came up:</p>
<p>1. In connection with the application of the Manila Pact to Communist resumption of hostilities over the election issue, it was generally agreed that the U.S. could act alone if necessary after consulting its allies. As Mr. <persName>Bowie</persName> emphasized, it would be important to show cause that the Free Vietnamese and others had made every normal effort to carry through with elections and that the onus for the breakdown was on the Communists. Mr. <persName>Bowie</persName> stated that the important point is for the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> to face up to the problem of what the United States will do if the Communists should react militarily. If the U.S. Government and the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> agree to intervene on behalf of Free Viet-Nam in such circumstances, then we can go ahead with a strong position on elections. If, on the other hand, we are going to back away from such intervention, we should not encourage <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to take an adamant position.</p>
<p>2. The Secretary felt that we needed flexibility in handling this whole matter in view of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s position. Our position in effect was that we were telling <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to do everything possible to frustrate the holding of elections by insisting on conditions which the Communists could not possibly accept, and then if the Communists attack we would indicate to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in advance that we would intervene on his side. This did not seem to be altogether a sound position, particularly if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had some different views.</p>
<p>3. The question of whether the elections provision is binding on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was discussed at length. Since he has accepted some of the benefits of the Geneva Accords, is he thereby morally or otherwise obligated to adhere to other provisions of the Geneva Accords? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> <pb xml:id="pg_440" n="440" facs="0470"/>emphasized that, whether he is legally bound or not, the effect and intent of the Geneva Accords was to arrange for a political settlement by elections. If that settlement is frustrated in any way the United States and Free Viet-Nam will face great difficulty with the French and British.</p>
<p>4. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s current position was also discussed: he is not bound by and must dissociate himself from the Geneva Accords, he must have an agreement with the French on the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> first, and he has no mandate regarding elections until a National Assembly is formed. It was recognized that there is much force in his arguments and that he is in a strong position to make these claims. However, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s delays will provoke <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> or other intervention which could be dangerous. The question was raised as to how far the U.S. should or could go in compelling him to follow through in accordance with the Geneva Accords. Should we tell him that U.S. military intervention will not come if he does not follow the Geneva Accords. The Secretary put the matter this way: If <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> does not conform to the provisions of the Geneva Accords and if the Viet Minh invades Free Viet-Nam, would we or would we not consider the Viet Minh action a breach of the accords and would come to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s aid or not by invoking the Manila Pact? If <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> does conform fully to the provisions of the Geneva Accords, consults with the Viet Minh, takes the desired position on the genuinely free elections and then the Viet Minh are so frustrated that they invade with force, we apparently would then consider that a breach of the Geneva Accords, and invoke the Manila Pact. The question was left for further consideration.</p>
<p>5. It was also recognized that the French, British and Indians would insist on a precise implementation of the Geneva Accords. They might also water down position on free elections.</p>
<p>6. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> pointed out that as far as we know <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s policy is not yet hardened. His attitude seems to divide into two main categories: (a) the general proposition of genuinely free elections which he probably accepts, although he fears the French, British and Indians will put tremendous pressure on him to compromise with the Viet Minh; and (b) the important questions of the basis and arrangements for consultations with the Viet Minh. It is this current aspect of the problem that appears to be giving <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> the most concern.</p>
<p>7. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> also pointed out that the Viet Minh might attempt to define the term “competent representative authorities of the two zones”, in the third sentence of para. 7 of the Geneva Declaration, as meaning the French High Command in the southern Zone.</p>
<p>8. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> showed the Secretary the joint statement issued by representatives of the Viet Minh and the French High Commands on May 17 (<gloss target="#t_FBIS1">FBIS</gloss> of June 7) which stated both parties believed in implementing <pb xml:id="pg_441" n="441" facs="0471"/>scrupulously the clauses and provisions of the Geneva Accords dealing with consultations and elections.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Postponement of Briefing Paper on <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5519, “U.S. Policy on All-Viet-Nam Elections” up for Council Consideration on June 9</item>
</list>
<p>I suggest that you recommend to the Council postponement of its consideration of this paper at least until certain aspects of it can be clarified, and with no definite date set for any reconsideration.</p>
<p>The reasons for deferment are as follows:</p>
<p>1. It may not be possible to implement the paper as drafted. It assumes <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will go along with consultations with the Viet Minh and that a clear-cut issue over free elections will come about. That may not be correct.</p>
<p>2. Before we formalize any statement of policy on this subject we should have a clearer and more precise view of the Vietnamese position than at present.</p>
<p>3. The question of pre-electoral consultations on July 20, 1955, with the Viet Minh is becoming a major political and diplomatic problem. The French, British, Indians, and the Viet Minh will insist on them.</p>
<p>4. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and his government may refuse because in his view:</p>
<list>
<item>a) He and his government did not sign the Geneva Accord and protested it. Therefore he is not legally bound by its provisions on elections. He wants to dissociate Free Viet-Nam completely from the Accord and does not feel compelled to meet with the Viet Minh beginning on July 20th.</item>
<item>b) Free Viet-Nam cannot consider the question of consultations and elections until after a National Assembly has been elected and convoked, and has declared its views. He has no mandate to talk with the Viet Minh about elections until he has the backing of some representative body.</item>
<item>c) The status and responsibilities of the French Expeditionary Corps and the French High Command must first be settled before <pb xml:id="pg_442" n="442" facs="0472"/>determining his policy on consultations and elections. Free Viet-Nam must have unquestioned and complete sovereignty prior to adopting any public position on free elections.</item>
<item>d) While the opposition to the principle of genuine and adequate safeguards is acceptable, international pressures will compel them to compromise with the Viet Minh and so lose Free Viet-Nam.</item>
</list>
<p>5. The purpose of the draft paper was to take a position so our policy in the event of Viet Minh aggression would be clear. We have been calling <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s attention to the dangers in his taking a negative position. These are: (a) he will give the impression of being against free elections, while the Viet Minh seize the initiative and for propaganda purposes seem to be for them; (b) his rejection of consultations will provoke the International Control Commission, or the two co-chairmen to set the date, place and circumstances for consultations; and (c) the Viet Minh might seize upon his opposition as a pretext for terrorist and subversive activities in Free Viet-Nam before he is strong enough to combat them, or even to threaten military aggression. This would hinder our position on military reactions.</p>
<p>6. Accordingly, it would be better to proceed with our exchange of views in Saigon with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, as well as with the British, French and Canadians before fixing a draft statement of policy. We will need a maximum amount of maneuverability in any event.</p>

<p>As Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> began to brief the National Security Council on the content of the subject report (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5519), the President interrupted to inquire of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> whether this was not the report which he, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, desired to postpone. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> acknowledged that he had suggested postponement of Council consideration of this problem because the situation was not sufficiently clear to warrant Council action at this time. The British and the French, not to mention the Government of Free Vietnam, had not yet made their positions clear with respect to the election problem. If the Council were to consider this paper now, it would only be obliged to go through the process again at a later date.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that the people in the Department of Defense felt exactly the same way as the Secretary of State about this matter.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> then briefly explained that the Planning Board had submitted the present draft report as a result of a Council directive of last January. He said that he too had entertained doubts as to whether the technique and details of the election problem in Vietnam were properly in the realm of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policy. He said accordingly he was perfectly happy to defer action on this aspect of the problem, but that he did feel that it would be useful if the Planning Board were authorized to study the paragraph in our basic policy on Vietnam (paragraph 5–d of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5429/5) which was concerned with the more general matter of what the United States should do in the event that the Communists renewed aggression in Vietnam. This question was not altogether clear, and was certainly suitable for <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> action.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> nodded agreement to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName>’s proposal.</p>

<p>Dear Freddie: The issue of elections in 1956 and consultations with the Viet Minh are the current top-drawer aspects of Viet-Nam. A brief <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper was prepared for the Council’s consideration on June 9, which we discussed Wednesday afternoon with the Secretary.<note n="2" xml:id="d207fn2">See <ref target="#d204">Document 204</ref>.</note> For various reasons, it was decided to recommend indefinite postponement of the Council’s consideration of the paper, which the Council accepted. I am attaching a copy of the briefing memoranda I did for the Secretary on this subject, as well as some informal notes on our meeting with him.<note n="3" xml:id="d207fn3">The notes were not attached to the source text; for texts of the briefing memoranda, see <ref target="#d203">Documents 203</ref> and <ref target="#d205">205</ref>.</note></p>
<p>Some of us are quite impressed with the position of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> as reported in your telegrams. It seems to us it makes a lot of sense for him to get his position worked out with the French and ensure Big <pb xml:id="pg_445" n="445" facs="0475"/>Three support of his government. There is also a good deal of merit in his claims that he must not associate himself in any way with the Geneva Accord and that he must have some democratic mandate before entering into such a serious matter as consultations with the Viet Minh. Vietnamese officials betray a good deal of apprehension and suspicion which I think is well founded. Will they not be exposed to tremendous pressures to compromise with the Viet Minh? Is there not a possibility that they might have to accept some agreement which would in effect result in a Viet Minh victory? These are real concerns. The thinking here is more and more that the United States, itself not a signatory, should not try to compel <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to follow through precisely according to the Geneva Accords. It may be that his way could be a lot more effective.</p>
<p>This will run into numerous difficulties and risks. The French, British and Indians are going to press us hard to force him into line. There may be even another crisis over <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, this time with the French laying down an ultimatum that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> must go or else. Also the Viet Minh will probably strike up a belligerent and threatening barrage of words. This may in turn be coupled with subversive and terrorist activities in the South. Ultimately, of course, there is the threat of a Viet Minh invasion.</p>
<p>On the other hand <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> may be in a strong position nationally and internationally. He is trying to save people from Communism. He does not want to be forced into complying with a document he rejected and has never recognized. He does not want to assume the position of a dictator engaging in profoundly important talks with the enemy before there is some democratic expression in the South giving him a valid and legal mandate. He is not going to be forced into this by the French. On the other hand the Viet Minh in the eyes of the Vietnamese are forcing the Geneva Accords on the country and are working closely with the French to do this. In the United States, and I suspect many other countries, there will be great sympathy and support for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and the Nationalists.</p>
<p>These are just tentative views but we are trying to work up something for high level decisions.</p>
<p>With very good wishes,</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

For <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName>’s and the Embassy staff’s information, the Washington agencies sending the cable required an explanation of requirements for additional funds over $223.4 million already obligated for Vietnamese troop support and an estimate of Vietnam’s ability to increase its own financial contributions to the program and others.

<p>1.

<p>2. a.

<p>b. Political events of past months and difficulties between govt and sects have drastically upset military program in all its aspects with consequent impact on original cost estimates for period to date and for balance of year. Most obvious development has been slow-down in schedule of force reductions, coupled with integration by govt of sect forces into army, thus creating higher level of forces than expected. Additional $40 million requested in <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 5172<note n="3" xml:id="d208fn3">The reference is in error; it should be to telegram 5173 from Saigon, May 10. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/5–1055)</note> were funds estimated as required to meet cost of such larger forces, including integration of sect troops as part of long-range solution to sect problem proposed to in [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] govt in <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> plan.</p>
<p>c. Although pay, allowances, and personnel support element of costs of forces have been greater than the original estimate due to higher troop strength, it now appears, after country team analysis, that U.S. fund requirements for other items will be less than expected. For example, during first five months <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss>55 practically none of planned construction was able to be carried out, and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> estimated <pb xml:id="pg_447" n="447" facs="0477"/>that over entire year only two-thirds of funds designated in original construction program can be obligated.</p>
<p>3. Following is situation as it now stands:</p>
<list>
<item>a. Strength of Vietnamese armed forces as of 1 June 55 was 182,000 of which 17,000 are sect forces. 3,000 additional sect forces will be integrated under <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> plan.</item>
<item>b. Conscription of low-pay personnel does not appear feasible in <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss>55.</item>
<item>c. A total of $108.1 million has been spent or committed for support of <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> forces thus far in <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss>55 (to 1 June). Of the entire $303.2 million, there thus remains $195.1 million for balance of <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss>55.</item>
<item>d. The reduction of force level by 31 Dec 55 at the slowest of reduction rates to 170,000 (including 20,000 sects), a level believed by the Chief, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> to be minimum that should be reached in light of operational requirements, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> now estimates that [$]26.8 million additional will be needed for <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss>55. Country team recognizes that larger force reductions this year would be desirable, but believes possibility that conditions of internal instability that have thus far caused delay in forces reduction program may continue throughout rest of year, and we should be prepared for this contingency. Country team therefore urges that 26.8 million (in lieu of $40 million requested in <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 5173) be made available.</item>
</list>
<p>4. Force strength for June through December estimated to average 182,000 costing $31.7 million per month for seven month total of $221.9 million. This calculation based on $2,000 per man year plus additional $1.3 million per month for construction new facilities during last seven months to make up part of construction program delayed during first five months. Reduction of 12,000 to end-year level of 170,000 will be made latter months of year (Nov, Dec) if conditions permit. No assurance present political conditions will be stabilized sooner hence funds requested in light present situation.</p>
<p>5. Estimates of portion to be financed by local currency and portion by foreign exchange is based on tentative breakdown provided by Defense Ministry. Criterion used was whether items to be purchased are easily available in <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> or need to be purchased abroad. Estimate is for 89 percent piastre expenditures and 11 percent foreign exchange expenditures.</p>
<p>6. Costs for <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss>56: If forces at beginning of <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss>56 are at strength of 170,000, costs for <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss>56 will be much higher than $180 million originally estimated when it was assumed level would have been reduced to 100,000 by 1 Jan 56 and conscription begun 1 Sep 55. Estimate of specific costs depends on what reduction schedule is followed in <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss>56. In this connection attention invited to <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> report titled “Development of a Force Basis for a Time-Phased <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>57 <gloss target="#t_MDA1">MDA</gloss> <pb xml:id="pg_448" n="448" facs="0478"/>Program for Indo-China”<note n="4" xml:id="d208fn4">Dated May 23, not printed.

<list><item>a. On basis <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> recommendations, total cost <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss>56 would be $336 million compared to $180 million originally estimated, and would entail increasing U.S. contribution from <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>56 funds by difference $156 million, inasmuch as <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> considered unable increase its contribution.</item></list>
<p>7. Re <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> increase in its financial contribution for <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss>55 beyond $79.8 million presently estimated, country team believes such increase not possible for following reasons:</p>
<list>
<item>a. Increase in 800 million piastre surplus in civilian budget not likely since, as result of slow-down in importing, anticipated government revenues from customs duties may fall short of <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> expectation. Reduction civil expenditures unlikely. Extra budget funds probably needed for Garde Civile.</item>
<item>b. <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> Govt expected to borrow 400 million piastres from Central Bank to complete its contribution to military expenditures in <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss>55. Govt also plans other financing by this means, i.e., capital for investment bank and agricultural credit. Also govt will need to resort to increased deficit financing in <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss>56 when reimbursements of <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> contribution to 1954 military expenditures will not be forthcoming. Therefore increased borrowing from <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> National Bank to raise <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> contribution to military program in 1955 is considered unfeasible.</item>
</list>
<p>8. Summary:</p>
<list>
<item>a. $26.8 million of full $40 million additional funds requested <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 5173 now required to carry out military program <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss>55 with force strength outlined para 4 above. These funds would also satisfy requirements for sect integrations proposed in <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> plan. (It should be noted that govt has already integrated totals of sect forces approximately those proposed in <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> plan, i.e. 17,000 including 3,000 of Gen. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName>, although integrations have not been accompanied as yet by other actions suggested in plan such as demobilization and resettlement of sect forces and arrangement for specific locations of units.)</item>
<item>b. Costs of <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss>56 military program will depend on Washington decisions as to force levels to be supported in <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss>56 based upon recommendations contained in correspondence referred to in para 6 above.</item>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Viet-Nam</item>
</list>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion</p>
<p>Conditions have changed somewhat during the past couple of months when our basic thinking on elections in Viet-Nam was developed. This memorandum and attachments set out some of these changes and recommend a revised position for your approval.</p>
<p>As I see it, one of our basic objectives in Viet-Nam is to prevent the Communists from winning any kind of elections whereby they would take over control of all Viet-Nam by political and legal means. We would not object to an indefinite but ostensibly temporary division of Viet-Nam as presently constituted. The logical corollary of this policy is that neither side would undertake military operations to try to conquer the other. The real considerations then in such a policy are whether the Geneva signatories will condone a divided Viet-Nam, whether the Communists will resort to arms to obtain control of all Viet-Nam, and what means we have for carrying out our policy with the best chance of success.</p>
<p>Our preliminary position on free elections in Viet-Nam assumed the Communist bloc would never agree to genuinely free elections in Germany, Korea or Viet-Nam. There are some slight warnings that this assumption may no longer hold true and in any event should be critically tested. It is conceivable that the Soviets might change their position on Germany and perhaps even on Korea. If they did, they might certainly come out strongly for free elections in Viet-Nam where they might have at this stage a much better chance for winning than in Korea or Germany. It therefore appears necessary for us to enlarge the scope of our position on elections so that it can accommodate political developments in Free Viet-Nam and better provide an opportunity to achieve our objectives.</p>
<p>Our preliminary views on elections also assumed that the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government would go through with consultations with the Viet Minh beginning on July 20, 1955, make no trouble over the Geneva Accords, and advocate generally free elections with adequate safeguards, etc. This assumption is no longer true. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will not be bound by the Geneva Accords. He presently opposes consultations or <pb xml:id="pg_450" n="450" facs="0480"/>statements on elections until he has secured certain military agreements from the French and until a National Assembly has been formed. These conditions of his have much merit and permit us to shift somewhat the basis for our position. This is suggested in the attached position paper.</p>
<p>In essence our position would be that the whole subject of consultations and elections in Viet-Nam should be left up to the Vietnamese themselves and not dictated by external agreements which one of the parties never accepted and still rejects. We would continue to stand on the U.S. declaration at Geneva and continue to favor genuinely free elections for unification. The position of the Vietnamese Government would be greatly strengthened if it had the backing and the opinion of a National Assembly. This position would be strictly in keeping with the fundamental doctrine of “consent of the governed”. The U.S. cannot be a party to political acts or decisions which do not reflect the will of the people validly ascertained and expressed.</p>
<p>This leaves the question of possible resumption of hostilities by the Viet Minh on any pretext over the failure to open consultations on July 20 or failure to come to an agreement on the unification of Viet-Nam. The current “peace offensive” of International Communism makes Viet Minh renewal of hostilities improbable but the U.S. should be prepared for such an eventuality. We should know how far the U.S. will go in backing up <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. We should be able to tell him that, if he takes a strong position advocating genuinely free elections, the U.S. would come to his side with military support if the Viet Minh should resort to aggression. We will also have to face up to the possibility in the next month or two that the Viet Minh will exert a tremendous pressure on Free Viet-Nam through threats and terrorism. We should also be able to give <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> some assurances of support in this contingency. This whole matter is now the subject of a review within the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>.</p>
<p>There may be additional difficulties in our position. The growing strength of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and the Nationalist forces will compel the Viet Minh to revise their entire strategy and tactics on Viet-Nam. If the French reject <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s position, it may bring about a serious cleavage between them which will raise a critical policy problem for the U.S. The French may even demand or try to bring about the replacement of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. The British and Indians may also oppose the above position and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s policy.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_451" n="451" facs="0481"/>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation</p>
<p>It is recommended that you approve the attached position papers on (a) consultations and elections, and (b) the status of the French Expeditionary Corps, and the French High Command in Viet-Nam.<note n="2" xml:id="d209fn2">There is a marginal note on the source text indicating that <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> saw this memorandum and a check indicating that the recommendation in this memorandum was approved.</note></p>
<p><hi rend="strong">[Tab A]</hi></p>
<p rend="center">VIET-NAM, CONSULTATIONS AND ELECTIONS</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Anticipated French and British Position</p>
<p>(a) They are primarily concerned now over getting consultations organized with the Viet Minh beginning on July 20 The French aide-mémoire May 23<note n="3" xml:id="d209fn3">A summary of what was more accurately described as the French “informal paper” of May 23, is in telegram 5104 from Paris, May 23. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/5–2355)</note> urged a tripartite agreement for presentation to the Vietnamese in four-power conference in Saigon.</p>
<p>(b) French will oppose <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s position of delay. They may also oppose negotiations with Vietnamese over <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> as a prior condition to consultations with the Viet Minh.</p>
<p>(c) The British will side with the French and urge strict compliance with Geneva Accords.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Vietnamese Position</p>
<p>1. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has not declared himself finally on consultations or elections. His present position appears to be:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) He and his government did not sign the Geneva Accords and protested them. Therefore he feels he is not legally bound by the provisions on elections, and will dissociate Free Viet-Nam completely from the Accords. He does not feel compelled to meet with the Viet Minh beginning on July 20th.</item>
<item>(b) Free Viet-Nam cannot consider the question of consultations and elections until after a National Assembly has been elected and convoked, and has declared its views. He has no mandate to talk with the Viet Minh about elections until he has the backing of some representative body.</item>
<item>(c) The status and responsibilities of the French Expeditionary Corps and the French High Command must first be settled before determining his policy on consultations and elections. Free Viet-Nam must have unquestioned and complete sovereignty prior to adopting any public position on free elections.</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_452" n="452" facs="0482"/>
<item>(d) While the principle of genuine and adequate safeguards for elections is acceptable, international pressures may compel the Vietnamese to compromise with the Viet Minh and so lose Free Viet-Nam. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> reportedly believes the U.S. will back him in insisting on full safeguards for truly free elections but is doubtful of British and French support if the Viet Minh offer seemingly reasonable counter-proposals.</item>
</list>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Position</p>
<p>1. We sympathize with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s position outlined above which seems logically and morally correct. He has not rejected the concept of free national elections. He is only registering a desire to proceed differently than prescribed at Geneva and with assurance of a popular and legal mandate from the free Vietnamese. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> seems in a strong position to make these claims.</p>
<p>2. We will continue to urge <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to take a vigorous public stand in favor of genuinely free elections for Viet-Nam with all necessary safeguards to ensure a true expression of the will of the people. However, we will not press him to begin consultations on July 20 if he can claim valid reasons for following another course and obtain Vietnamese support in his stand. Paragraph 7 of the Geneva Declaration does not seem to us to be a binding requirement to begin consultations exactly on the day of July 20, 1955.</p>
<p>3. We should tell <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) His attitude will provoke strong international pressures from the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, France and the Communists, on both Free Viet-Nam and the U.S. to implement the provisions of the Geneva settlement.</item>
<item>(b) If the Vietnamese find themselves alone on this issue and if they appear to be the violators of the Geneva Accords, the U.S. Government would be put in a very difficult position to come to their aid should the Viet Minh attack. U.S. public opinion might find support hard to justify if it seems <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is against free elections.</item>
<item>(c) Should the Viet Minh now oppose <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s position with strong terroristic action throughout the South, possibly including semi-military operations, Free Viet-Nam’s capability for counter-action would be less this year than probably will be a year from now.</item>
</list>
<p>4. We believe <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will have considerable support in Viet-Nam and the U.S. for his stand. Our own position on free elections would stand greater chances of implementation if the Vietnamese Government had the firm backing of a National Assembly before and during negotiations with the Viet Minh. This might also reduce the effectiveness of Viet Minh pressures.</p>
<p>5. We recognize that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s postponement of contacts with the Viet Minh in the South might engender very serious Communist counter-actions—possibly including renewed terrorism in the South <pb xml:id="pg_453" n="453" facs="0483"/>and open rebellion and guerrilla warfare by Communist elements, and conceivably even resumption of hostilities across the 17th. Parallel. There is also the problem of <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and Indian diplomatic pressures, as well as that of the signatories of the Geneva Declaration. All these parties will probably reject <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s position because of the very serious risks inherent in it. However, we believe on balance the position of the free world would be stronger if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s plan were supported rather than frustrated:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) There probably will be pressures upon the Viet Minh by Moscow and Peiping to avoid actions which might precipitate world conflict;</item>
<item>(b) Viet Minh capabilities in South—while great—are probably insufficient at this time to overthrow the Free Viet-Nam regime without direct Viet Minh military support from across the 17th Parallel;</item>
<item>(c) <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s position will be approved by the majority of his nationalist supporters in the South, and his courageous resistance to Viet Minh blandishments and threats may well make him increasingly popular and hence strong;</item>
<item>(d) We believe that if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> now can develop wide popular support for his position on elections he might be in a better position later to resist pressures from the British, French and Indians to accept what will probably seem to be “reasonable” Communist proposals for elections, although in fact such proposals would be cleverly designed to deliver all Viet-Nam to the Viet Minh.</item>
</list>
<p><hi rend="strong">[Tab B]</hi></p>
<p rend="center">THE STATUS OF <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> AND THE FRENCH HIGH COMMAND IN VIET-NAM</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Anticipated French Position</p>
<p>1. The French will probably seek our views in the light of the Vietnamese request of June 6 for negotiations on this subject. The French reaction is not yet definitely known.</p>
<p>2. However, French might react negatively to the Vietnamese proposal for negotiations and to the Vietnamese desire for a military agreement defining the responsibilities of the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> and the French High Command in Viet-Nam. On the other hand, the French may not oppose Vietnamese desire for total withdrawal French ground forces and retention of only naval and air forces. However, the French may ask us to permit withdrawal of two squadrons of B–26’s to Algeria, which would nullify the Vietnamese desire to retain some French air power.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_454" n="454" facs="0484"/>
<p>3. The Acting French Commander in Chief, Saigon, has informed our Embassy that all French forces are now concentrated in the area of Saigon and Cap St. Jacques except for a battalion of “symbolic value” near the 17th Parallel. Presumably the French intend to continue to concentrate the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> far in the South rather than maintain forces near the 17th Parallel to deter or meet aggression.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">United States Position</p>
<p>1. In general, it is better from the political viewpoint for France and the free world if France negotiates with the Vietnamese regarding the status of the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> and French High Command in Free Viet-Nam rather than to face nationalistic demands for an immediate and necessarily precipitate withdrawal of all French forces.</p>
<p>2. We hope the French will accept the Vietnamese request for negotiations in a friendly and constructive spirit and the negotiations will be quickly and effectively concluded in an agreement. Such negotiations would enhance the Vietnamese position. We see much political advantage in having the command responsibilities clarified so that there would be no doubt that the Government of Viet-Nam is fully responsible for internal security in Free Viet-Nam and is not dependent upon an outside power.</p>
<p>3. We would think that pursuant to Article IV of the Manila Pact and its Protocol France could negotiate a status of forces agreement with Viet-Nam regulating the responsibilities, obligations and location of residual French forces for the purpose of joint undertakings in meeting external aggression against Free Viet-Nam and a threat to the treaty area of a Viet Minh attack.</p>
<p>4. From a political point of view it would seem advisable for the concentration of French forces in the Saigon area to be reduced or eliminated in an orderly manner as soon as possible. The French Prime Minister made this suggestion during the Paris talks and the Secretary of State concurred. It would be preferable for majority of residual French ground forces to be stationed near the 17th Parallel if the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> is to retain any deterrent effect whatsoever.</p>
<p>5. If the Government of Viet-Nam desires the total withdrawal of French ground forces, the U.S. would not object. The Vietnamese Government is in a stronger internal position than two months ago. The increasing political liabilities of the presence of French forces in Viet-Nam may outweigh the military advantages, which were previously anticipated. If the French Government accepts this Vietnamese proposal, the U.S. would hope it would be carried out in an orderly manner and that French instructors would remain as an essential element in reorganizing, training, and providing logistic support for Vietnamese armed forces. At the same time there would be no political reason for opposing the retention, as a deterrent, of a small nucleus <pb xml:id="pg_455" n="455" facs="0485"/>of French ground forces with adequate air support stationed near the 17th Parallel for patrolling the demarcation line and occupying strategic or tactical bases in that area.</p>
<p>6. As to command relationships between French and Vietnamese, this is a matter for them to work out on the basis of the best possible mutual relationships by joint Vietnamese-French arrangements. If the responsibilities for external defense are settled, we see no need for the French to hold the position of commander in chief over Vietnamese forces, except in the event of aggression.</p>

His attitude toward the French continued to be critical, but he appeared considerably less bitter than in the past.</p>

<item>Visit with President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName></item>
</list>
<p>(4) The nature of my report was three-fold: The sad state of the agrarian reform; the poor progress of settling refugees on land, and the problems presented by local administration.</p>
<p>As to the agrarian reform, I told the President that the appointment of a Minister for Agrarian Reform<note n="4" xml:id="d210fn4"><persName corresp="#p_NVT2">Nguyen Van Thoi</persName>.</note> was certainly a step in the right direction but that, to date, the reform is not off the ground, and that there are no indications that the situation will undergo a favorable change in the immediate future. I pointed out why the tenants show no interest in his program; the potent influence of the Communists in this connection; the preference for land ownership to rent reduction; and the political and administrative vacuum in the countryside which prevents the enforcement of most measures sponsored by the National Government. I took the liberty of suggesting to the President that, if his government is to make any political capital of the agrarian reform, then the time has come to reexamine the entire problem in the light of the current state of affairs. More specifically, I suggested (1) that as long as the program is in being the Chief s of the Provinces in the non-sect areas be held responsible for the implementation of the program, and (2) a national conference of the interested parties with an eye to determining whether (a) the existing program can be implemented, (b) whether it should be abandoned altogether and a land ownership and land distribution program devised in its stead.</p>
<p>The President did not dispute the impasse reached by his program, but he does not intend to give the land reform question a national hearing. He has confidence in his new Minister of Agrarian Reform and is evidently willing to let him try his hand at it for a while longer. The President’s reluctance to review the issue with all the care it deserves may be traced also to, what appears to me, a lack <pb xml:id="pg_457" n="457" facs="0487"/>on his part of a truly abiding concern with this matter. I am not prepared to say whether the President’s attitude stems from the fact that he is not a “land reformer”, or that the more pressing day-to-day issues bordering on the very survival of his government have primacy in his thinking and his effort to the exclusion of much else, including agrarian reform. Whatever the real reason, this much can be said with certainty: on the occasion of this talk, as during all previous talks, the land reform problems did not appear to loom large in his scheme of things.</p>
<p>(5) As to the settlement of refugees on land, the President was informed that as of the end of May few refugees had been settled on land; by this is meant settlement in the sense that a refugee willing to farm has more than shelter and a garden patch, namely, well-demarcated holdings of their own, with farm tools and animal power to put the land to use. I pointed out to him that most of the farming by the refugees in this crop season, commencing with the rains, will have to be delayed until the crop season of 1956. The refugee problem being close to the heart of the President, he was visibly disturbed by the account and prospects. It is my impression that he had not been fully aware of these developments. I explained to him that I have not been too close to the problem and that I do not know all the reasons for the delay; I did point out that perhaps the basic one, a <hi rend="italic">firm</hi> evaluation of the total acreage available for settlement, its location and quality has not been made, and that this is the first order of business if the program is to be successfully implemented. With that in view, I suggested to the President that he immediately appoint a small commission with instructions and powers to determine the land availability, based on the commission’s first hand observations in the field. I suggested a time limit of one month, and assured him that the Mission (<gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>) will be happy to render its technical assistance to this urgently needed survey. The President responded favorably. Whether he will act accordingly, or, having discussed the matter with appropriate agencies, will act in favor of another method of moving refugees on land, remains to be seen. Whatever his future course of action, he is fully cognizant’ that the permanent solution of the refugee problem is yet to take shape, and that further delays may postpone the solution indefinitely.</p>
<p>(6) As to local administration, I stated that, with few exceptions, it is ineffective and that no application of any national legislation is possible unless the administrators themselves become conscious of the fact that a free and independent Vietnam demands of them a zeal and zest of performance over and beyond the customary. I expressed the view that the real difficulty with the administrators is not their lack of formal public administration training, but rather the lassitude, disinterestness and seeming failure to sense or comprehend the critical <pb xml:id="pg_458" n="458" facs="0488"/>transitional period Vietnam is passing through. I made the point that just as the National Army is in need of political training, the administrators are surely in the same need. The President countered by saying that this problem has been on his mind, that he ordered the Delegate for South Vietnam to prepare a secret report on local administration, and that the findings justified his worst fears. However, he did not believe he can deal with the problem outside of the overall issues relating to the country’s pacification and stabilization. Serious though the administration question is, for the time being he intended to leave it in the hands of the three Delegates of Vietnam.</p>
<p>The visitor did not argue the Presidential preference, nor did he tell him of his most recent experience in one of the most important provinces of South Vietnam, where a new Chief of Province appointed by the Delegate is unmistakenly anti-<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, anti-reform, and pretty much anti-everything that spells deviating from the current state of inaction.</p>
<p>I did tell the President that the standoffish attitude of the farmers vis-à-vis the Government is not unrelated to the local administration; above all, I suggested that it is closely related to the weak link between the National Government and the farmers. I elaborated on an earlier statement under somewhat similar circumstances and suggested that the President himself might devote some time to help create among the farmers a sense of freedom of participation, a sense of belonging with the Government in the business of creating a new State, basing this approach on the Government’s convincing appreciation of the people’s fundamental needs. I attempted to impress upon him that he more than any other Vietnamese is in a position to articulate these ideas, which in the long run should prove to be the effective weapon against the Viet Minh and for the stability of Vietnam. But now, as in the past, the President pleaded extreme pre-occupation with urgent matters.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> memo: Elections in Vietnam. An aide-memoire was handed to the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> High Commissioner in New Delhi on June 16 by the Indian Govt requesting the two co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference to intervene with the Vietnamese and Viet Minh authorities, in order to get consultations started about elections in Vietnam. The following is the text of the operative paragraphs:</p>
<list>
<item>“Having regard to the relations between the parties and the circumstances prevailing in Vietnam, it appears to the Government of India that consultations may not take place without some initiative being taken by the two co-chairmen. The Govt of India therefore feel that the co-chairmen should request the authorities in charge of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the State of Vietnam to start consultations. To facilitate such consultations they may further offer the parties the services of the three delegates on the International Supervisory Commission in Vietnam. The delegates will not act as members of the Commission but as individuals representing their respective govts and their task will be to assist the parties (a) to convene a conference of competent representative authorities of the two sides for interzonal consultations and to assist in the preparation and the approval of the agenda, and (b) to elect a chairman either from among themselves or from outside to preside over the deliberations of the Consultative Conference.</item>
<item>“The delegates from the Supervisory Commission will withdraw from the conference after the agenda has been settled and a chairman has been chosen to preside over the deliberations.</item>
<item>“The chairman agreed upon by the parties will act both as conciliator and as technical expert on the essentials of a free general <pb xml:id="pg_460" n="460" facs="0490"/>election by secret ballot and will assist the parties to come to agreed conclusions as regards the principles and procedure which would ensure free and fair general elections by secret ballot. Agreed modalities of the elections can thereafter be worked out and adopted by the authorities in each of the two zones as the law in force for the time being to regulate the elections. Thereafter the electoral commission envisaged in paragraph 7 of the Geneva Declaration will be set up to supervise the elections in accordance with the agreed principles and procedure.”</item>
</list>
<p>The aide-mémoire concludes with a request to the co-chairmen to put these proposals to the Vietnamese and Viet Minh authorities, and states that Canadian and Polish Govts have been informed with an expression of the Indians’ hope that they will agree to this procedure. An identical aide-mémoire has been handed to the Russian Chargé d’Affaires.</p>

<item>M. Pierre Millet, French Embassy</item>

</list>
<p><persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir Robert Scott</persName> summarized the British position as follows: His Government had always believed strongly that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should take some positive action with respect to the consultations on elections to be held in July 1956. Recently the United States had been opposed to pressing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, since he seemed not in the mood to move. This situation had been overtaken by the Indian aide-mémoire, which must be answered by the British whether or not <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> raised it in San Francisco.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_461" n="461" facs="0491"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Scott</persName> read Foreign Office comments on the Indian proposal: The Indian idea had the same disadvantage as the original French proposal, namely, the initiative was to be taken by the co-Chairmen. Britain did not want to get involved in joint action with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and did not wish to do anything which the United States would find unpalatable. Neither did they wish to suggest action by the supervisory powers, since <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> continued to regard the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> with suspicion. The Indian aide-mémoire could not, however, be rejected without some alternative. Consequently, the British would like to reply that they were already making representations to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> not inconsistent with the Indian aide-mémoire. The gist of these representations was contained in a paper given the Department by Joy of the British Embassy on June 13 (Annex 1). If the United States did not go along with the British proposal, the United Kingdom was inclined to favor unilateral representations to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> on their part, rather than accede to the Indian plan. Joy added that the Canadians were in possession of the Indian aide-mémoire and opposed its contents.</p>
<p>M. <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Millet</persName> declared his Government agreed with the British proposal and had no reason to believe that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would be opposed. <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> of the Quai d’Orsay in a telephone conversation this morning had informed <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Millet</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s special envoy to Paris, had seemed receptive and was on his way back to Saigon to determine <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s attitude toward the British proposition. M. Millet also stressed the French feeling that time was of the essence.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> stated that the United States considered the Indian proposal too elaborate and undoubtedly unacceptable to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. The American position was generally that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should be encouraged to make a public declaration favoring genuinely free elections. We should not, however, press him to enter formal consultations against his will, but should at the same time point out the dangers inherent in a negative attitude toward them.</p>
<p>The United States understood that the Indians must be presented with an alternative, and therefore was in principle in favor of acting on the British suggestion. The United States was in complete agreement with the idea of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s seizing the initiative, but considered his making specific proposals on the “time, place, and level of representation” could very well become a trap.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> stated that the use of the words “time, place, and level of representation” seemed to imply direct bipartite discussions probably in the demilitarized zone from the first stage of consultations onward. It was quite likely that such consultations would lead to another Panmunjom,<note n="2" xml:id="d212fn2">Reference is to the military armistice talks among the North Koreans, Chinese, and <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> Command, which had begun in 1951 and were still ongoing.</note> an eventuality which should be avoided. He <pb xml:id="pg_462" n="462" facs="0492"/>suggested that, since the mechanics of consultations were not spelled out, it might be better for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and his allies if consultations were informal, indirect, and not public. Such an arrangement would not violate the spirit of the Geneva Agreements, inasmuch as consultations would in effect take place. <persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Scott</persName> commented that this seemed not inconsistent with their proposal, which was in essence only that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should take some sort of initiative. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> also emphasized the need to assure the Vietnamese of Western support, since the Vietnamese looked on the elections with real apprehension.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> also put forward the idea of exploring the British statement, in their proposed démarche to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, of their willingness to serve as the relay point for communications from Viet-Nam to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to the Viet Minh. It might be possible first to develop an atmosphere of consultation, actually getting the parties together later. This was simply a method worth investigating, and not a fixed U.S. position. The British representatives gave their opinion that such a plan might work in the beginning, but not as a standing arrangement, since the distinction between the British acting as a <hi rend="italic">Government,</hi> that is, an interested bystander, rather than as co-Chairman was a difficult one.</p>
<p>In response to an inquiry as to Indian views on elections in general, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> said that Krishna Menon desired an exact implementation of the Geneva Accords, and believed elections should be held regardless of the outcome.</p>
<p>It was the sense of the meeting that 1) the Indian proposal was unacceptable; 2) some reply must be made to New Delhi; 3) this reply should be that the British had already taken steps to urge <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to begin consultations; 4) the words “time, place, and level of representation” might be going too far and therefore should be omitted from the suggested British démarche. (This was the opinion particularly of the United States representatives, but seemed to have the tacit agreement of the other participants.)</p>
<p>It was agreed that the results of the meeting should be communicated separately to the three Foreign Ministers, since instructions to the three parties from New York were not identical.</p>
<p>No action was taken on M. Millet’s reiterated suggestion that a tripartite working group on Vietnamese elections be reactivated in Paris or London, in view of the fact that the San Francisco discussions might make such a working group unnecessary. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> declared that the United States was basically opposed to tripartite talks which would appear as a Western “ganging-up” on the Vietnamese, but would go along with ad hoc discussions which would not aim to decide the destinies of smaller powers.</p>
<p>The meeting left vague the question of what the three States should say to <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> at San Francisco. It is assumed that, should he <pb xml:id="pg_463" n="463" facs="0493"/>raise the matter, replies would be made along the lines of the four agreed points outlined above.<note n="3" xml:id="d212fn3"><persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> reported the results of this tripartite meeting to <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> in a memorandum to the Secretary, June 18.

<p>GIST OF PROPOSED DÉMARCHE BY H.M. AMBASSADOR AT SAIGON, AS ONE OF THE TWO <gloss target="#t_CO1">CO</gloss>-CHAIRMEN OF THE GENEVA CONFERENCE</p>
<p>“Quite apart from the question on the line which might be taken during the preliminary electoral discussions scheduled to begin on July 20, it would be very much to the benefit of the international position of the Government of South Vietnam for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to take up a positive and forthcoming attitude towards the holding of these talks. In our view he would be well-advised to make specific proposals as to time and place and level of representation and to give full publicity to the fact that he has taken this initiative. In the matter of publicity Her Majesty’s Government and other friendly Governments would naturally be happy to assist. It is hoped that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will be able at a very early date to prepare such specific concrete proposals which could then, if he wished, be passed to Her Majesty’s Government, who would be happy to convey them to the Soviet Government (as the other co-Chairman of the Geneva Conference) for onward transmission to the Vietminh authorities.”</p>

<p>1. Following are your instructions regarding British démarche to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>:</p>
<list>
<item>a. Although U.S. agreed British proposal with omission words “time place level representation”, actual démarche to be made by British only.<note n="3" xml:id="d214fn3">A report on the démarche is in telegram 5947 from Saigon, June 23. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/6–2355)</note></item>
<item>b. Should <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> inquire our position on démarche, tell him we continue fully support Vietnamese Government in favoring genuinely free elections with adequate safeguards. We believe it beneficial for Government make public pronouncement these lines. Nevertheless we have never wished push Vietnamese participate formal consultations beginning July 20 against their inclinations, but at same time have felt it necessary point out disadvantages negative attitude toward consultations which might be interpreted as rejection Geneva Accords. Pressures from all sides have been increasing rapidly recent weeks almost to point where failure Vietnamese begin consultations would forfeit large measure support of states interested primarily in implementation Geneva Agreements. We considered British proposal as generally in line our view Vietnamese should take stand on genuinely free elections and as method satisfying international pressures while giving Vietnamese time work out own position on methods consultation. We had therefore concurred.</item>
</list>
<p>2. British Embassy says messages received here indicate <persName corresp="#p_SSHS1">Stephenson</persName> instructions confined British démarche per se, with no mention informing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> of Indian aide-mémoire. Although unaware Foreign Office thinking, British here believe that, though <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> undoubtedly will eventually learn of Indian proposal, the later he finds out the better, since it bound exacerbate his attitude toward <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>, particularly Indians.</p>
<p>While recognizing truth last phrase, we concerned effect British and our relations with Vietnamese if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> learns of Indian aide-mémoire from other sources, especially since <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, Poles, Canadians, French, and probably Viet Minh now also informed. We agree with British that, since they recipients Indian note, they are only logical informants, if decision taken apprise <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_466" n="466" facs="0496"/>
<p>Request Saigon’s comments whether: 1) You should discuss with <persName corresp="#p_SSHS1">Stephenson</persName> problem informing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> of Indian note; and 2) Whether Embassy London should approach Foreign Office same lines.</p>
<p>If you discover <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> already aware Indian proposal, this could of course be cited as factor in our decision agree to British démarche.</p>
<p>3. Following is that portion U.S. position Vietnamese elections which <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> read British French representatives June 18 meeting:</p>
<list>
<item>“Free Vietnamese must have complete and steady backing in whole process electoral consultations to assure them they will be fully supported in taking stand for genuinely free elections.</item>
<item>We should continue urge Free Vietnamese make public declaration in favor genuinely free elections with all adequate safeguards. We should not try compel Vietnamese participate formal consultations beginning July 20, 1955, while pointing out difficulties and risks of completely negative attitude toward whole problem consultations and elections.</item>
<item>Formal direct confrontation delegations North Viet-Nam and South Viet-Nam in Panmunjom style may not be necessary or desirable at least in initial stages. Conference with formal agenda, chairman, regularized deliberations also might not be suitable for discussions in first instance between two such bitter adversaries.”</item>
</list>
<p>Saigon’s comments requested.<note n="4" xml:id="d214fn4"><p>Those comments, in telegram 5981 from Saigon, June 25, read as follows:</p>
<p>“1. We fully concur Department’s reasoning Section 2, reference telegram. We estimate danger <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> learning of Indian note indirectly might lead to unnecessary suspicions and would present greater problem than his possible irritation with Indians. We believe matter should be discussed with British here and London.</p>
<p>“2. We also agree with US position set forth Section 3, reference telegram. At present moment it seems unlikely <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could be persuaded to go any further by July 20 than consultation by means of written communication through co-president. To attempt push him further is to us unrealistic.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/6–2555)</p></note></p>

<item>Revision in Force Levels and Costs for Vietnamese Military Forces</item>
</list>
<pb xml:id="pg_467" n="467" facs="0497"/>
<p>The purpose of this memorandum is to bring to your attention a problem assuming importance from the political, military and economic point of view. In preparing the Vietnamese program for fiscal 1956 we sent out a joint State–Defense–<gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> message to Saigon<note n="2" xml:id="d215fn2">Telegram 5235 to Saigon, May 25; see <ref target="#d208fn2">footnote 2, Document 208</ref>.</note> requesting information on force levels and costs. The reply<note n="3" xml:id="d215fn3"><ref target="#d208">Document 208</ref>.</note> gave a split opinion.</p>
<p><gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Saigon recommends the force level of 170,000 until July 1, 1956 with a reduction thereafter to 150,000 by December 31, 1956 with conscription starting January 1, 1957. The Embassy and the <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> Mission both recommend a reduction to 100,000 by the end of 1955 and the beginning of conscription early in 1956. The latter recommendation is much closer to the <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> figures approved by Washington last February.</p>
<p>The <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> recommendations would entail a total cost in calender 1956 of $336 million compared to our present estimate of $180 million. Since the Vietnamese Government probably would not be able to assume any part of this additional cost, the field estimates the United States would have to assume the total addition of $156 million.</p>
<p>A message from the field states that the costs for the military program in calender 1956 will depend on Washington decisions regarding force levels.</p>
<p>The special working group on Indochina has met twice on this telegram.<note n="4" xml:id="d215fn4">Reports of these <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> meetings are in memoranda of discussions by Kenneth P. Landon of the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>, June 15 and 23. (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> Files: Lot 62 D 430, Southeast Asia)</note> We have discussed the political, military and economic implications at length without coming to any decision. We have instructed a subcommittee to prepare a telegram to the field asking for more information. Accordingly, in a week or two this matter may have to be raised at a higher level in order to determine whether we should continue with the <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> program of a drastic reduction and a large-scale demobilization or whether we should phase down the Vietnamese forces much more slowly. At the present time I recommend a slower reduction even though it will cost us more money.</p>

<p>597A. Reference: Paris 5256 to Department, repeated Saigon 751.<note n="2" xml:id="d216fn2">In this telegram, May 31, <persName>Dillon</persName> informed the Department that <persName corresp="#p_GGAL1">General Guillaume</persName> was planning an information-gathering trip to the Far East and would be in Saigon, June 19–24. The purpose of the Saigon visit, according to <persName corresp="#p_GGAL1">Guillaume</persName>, was to decide how rapidly repatriation of the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> from Vietnam could proceed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751.551/5–3155)</note></p>
<p>1. <persName corresp="#p_GGAL1">General Guillaume</persName> has just completed four day inspection French military establishment Vietnam. Before his departure today for Singapore, he lunched with me alone and discussed at length the French military problem in area.</p>
<p>2. He said purpose his visit was to obtain information on which to base military recommendation to French Govt. He reviewed situation in France where one school of thought called for immediate and complete evacuation of French military from Indochina and other favored retention of at least sufficient numbers to protect French colony Saigon, preserve remnants of French face, and make modest contribution to defense against Communism in area. He said former school was now strengthened by serious requirements in North Africa which obviously took first priority French thinking. Apart from military recommendation, probably most important factor which would affect eventual govt decision was financial one. He feared that, in new situation created by termination German occupation support costs and ever-increasing burden of North African problem, it might be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to obtain budgetary support for continued French military presence Indochina on any appreciable scale.</p>
<p>3. In reply to his inquiry, I told him that, in my personal view, presence of French military forces here was for several reasons apart from purely French ones desirable for immediate future. These were the requirements for their assistance in training <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> National Army, Navy and Air Force; need to avoid sudden creation of vacuum pending build-up of Vietnamese forces; and importance, from an overall strategic point of view, of retaining operative naval and air bases in area, a responsibility which <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> could not possibly take over for some time. Finally, I said it seemed to me that it also would be quite awhile before Vietnamese army would be capable of assuming full responsibility for its own administrative and logistic support. I <pb xml:id="pg_469" n="469" facs="0499"/>added, however, that I considered basic condition to the success of the foregoing were bilateral Franco-Vietnamese arrangements which defined status and mission of French forces in mutually acceptable manner which no way impaired sovereign independence of Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_GGAL1">Guillaume</persName> took no exception to this but seemed to doubt whether sufficient budgetary support would be forthcoming to finance initial force of about 50,000 which would be required for this mission.</p>
<p>4. He insisted more than once that there were two fundamental elements of French policy which could be accepted as absolute, namely:</p>
<list>
<item>a. France would under no circumstances, permit herself to become engaged again in ground combat in Indochina; and</item>
<item>b. Whatever military policy was decided for this area, it must be one that did not involve a large measure of risk.</item>
</list>
<p>5. <persName corresp="#p_GGAL1">Guillaume</persName> divided French military picture in <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> into three parts:</p>
<list>
<item>(1) Tourane area and 17th parallel. He said large munitions depot at Tourane posed a problem for French, but they were determined to pass it to Vietnamese and equally determined that they would not keep more than symbolic forces, say a maximum of 5,000 in area of Tourane and 17th parallel. He asserted that local political situation there was troubled and difficult for them, and they were determined, as a matter of policy, to avoid any involvement in internal politics.</item>
<item>(2) Saigon area. He realized that, for political reasons, Vietnamese would prefer French to withdraw from Saigon area. He thought that, as far as mission of protecting European colony Saigon was concerned, this might be accomplished by basing certain units at reasonable distance from city, such as in area of Bien Hoa Air Base. More difficult problem was posed on navy side. French naval base was only large and important French repair installation in Far East and was capable of handling vessels up to cruiser size. If this base were to be retained, it would require some territorial defense, and that involved stationing of some French forces in city. French navy was understandably reluctant to abandon this base which they would feel compelled to do in the absence of provision for its preservation.</item>
<item>(3) Cap St. Jacques. He did not know whether concept of well fortified naval and air base at Cap St. Jacques would be acceptable to Vietnamese. From French point of view, it had obvious advantages. The materially improved and enlarged air strip was virtually complete, and the utilization of Cap St. Jacques as the major French military base for all three services in Vietnam would involve little additional financial burden on French Govt. French navy was still hankering after Cam Ranh Bay, but apart from questionable strategic value, expense of developing facilities and area defense there would be prohibitive.</item>
</list>
<p>6. Although it was apparent that <persName corresp="#p_GGAL1">Guillaume</persName> had reached no firm conclusion, I was left with impression that, for the moment at least, <pb xml:id="pg_470" n="470" facs="0500"/>he was inclining toward recommending retention of French military establishment here for the next eighteen months of about 50,000 men but was not at all sure that this would be approved by French Govt. In this connection, he stated that level of French forces was now down to 55,000 and that there was leeway of only 5,000 before decision would have to be reached if reduction were to be stopped at 50,000 level. As a limiting factor on timing of a possible total evacuation of French forces, <persName corresp="#p_GGAL1">Guillaume</persName> mentioned that his colleagues estimated a minimum of six months would be required to deal with and distribute mass of military material in their possession.</p>
<p>7. <persName corresp="#p_GGAL1">Guillaume</persName> expressed earnest conviction that only unified and cooperative US-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-French approach to problem of <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> would have chance of saving area. He recognized, however, that British were not prepared to give any material support. Recently in London, British <gloss target="#t_COS1">COS</gloss> had stated to him quite clearly that Singapore and Malayan Peninsula were their maximum commitment in <gloss>SEA</gloss>.</p>

<p>6040. 1. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Vu Van Mau</persName> informed me this morning that Cabinet had decided on its position with respect to Geneva type elections and consultations called for in Geneva Agreement. It had been decided that Prime Minister would make public declaration containing following elements:</p>
<list>
<item>a. Government stood for unification of Vietnam.</item>
<item>b. This to be achieved by democratic process of elections.</item>
<item>c. Elections must be free and protected by all necessary safeguards.</item>
<item>d. This position was not of Geneva Agreement which Government did not recognize but was an expression of Government’s earnest desire for unification of country through democratic process.</item>
</list>
<p>2. Cabinet was considering a possible supplemental point to effect that Government of State of Vietnam was sole legal Government in country and was preparing election to National Assembly which, when convened, would welcome proposals from all Vietnamese <pb xml:id="pg_471" n="471" facs="0501"/>political parties designed to effect, in democratic fashion, the unification of the country. I think I convinced <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Mau</persName> that this variant might best be saved for possible later use.</p>
<p>3. As to timing of Prime Minister’s declaration, <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Mau</persName> said former had intended to make it some time after July 20. He agreed with my comment that an earlier date would have many advantages and said he thought it might be possible to convince Prime Minister to take the step within a week or 10 days.</p>
<p>4. Foreign Minister said he expected to reply to British démarche within a day or two conveying information regarding proposed public declaration on elections and politely refusing British offer to serve as postman for communication to Viet Minh. He confirmed that Cabinet decision precluded Government taking any initiative with respect to consultations, adding that if other side wished to use Moscow–London circuit, that was their business, but that his Government wished to avoid implications which would flow from accepting good offices of co-chairman Geneva conference. Furthermore, it was impossible, for internal political reasons, for Government to take any initiative with respect consultations. (Request substance this paragraph not be conveyed to British since <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> position may change before their note is drafted and delivered.)</p>
<p>5. Foreign Minister then handed me brief biography Sarah Wambaugh, saying it would be extremely useful if such a specialist in international elections could be attached to Embassy to back-stop Foreign Office. He added that personality suggested was simply chosen as an example of the kind of expert required. He agreed that, if a suitable expert of other than American nationality could be found, it Would be preferable. I assured Foreign Minister I would pass his request to Department and told him of <persName corresp="#p_KPM1">Kattenburg</persName>’s arrival and that for next few weeks his services would be available.</p>
<p>6. From foregoing, I conclude that present intention <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government is to make policy declaration along lines indicated, take no further step with respect to consultations and await developments. Renewed request for services of expert would seem, however, very clear indication that they do not preclude an eventual involvement in some kind of negotiations with Viet Minh on subject of elections whether by conference or remote control.</p>

<p>3.

Regardless particular figures forces and costs finally accepted, Vietnamese must begin face up to problems reducing total costs armed forces, increasing own contribution, and reducing U.S. contribution thereto.

<p>5. Several basic questions arise connection Washington consideration your 5769.</p>
<list>
<item>a. What political, economic, and military pros and cons maintaining forces <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> ’56 at 150,000, plus 40,000 garde civile, comparison <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>’ recommendation 100,000 and no additional forces?</item>
<item>b. What are probable Vietnamese plans and desires regarding forces?</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_473" n="473" facs="0503"/>
<item>c. What are possibilities reducing average cost per soldier in addition to conscription?</item>
<item>d. Why must conscription be delayed 15 months?</item>
<item>e. Why cannot demobilization be pressed harder?</item>
<item>f. Even if decision were favorable maintain forces above 100,000 might not further cost studies and increased control Vietnamese military budget lead to reduction over-all cost?</item>
<item>g. Are additional cost and budget control personnel needed Saigon?</item>
</list>
<p>6. Recognize paragraph 6 and 7 <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> are initial estimate. Further refinement and reduction over-all cost will be necessary so that U.S. can meet strength needs Vietnamese armed forces, and cost still can be kept within limits which will be set by foreign aid appropriation. Immediate future should be devoted to setting up mechanisms whereby U.S. control over-all costs would be more effective, especially with view over-all reduction costs. Advise what steps you have taken this direction, what cost studies you have made, and what additional these lines needed.</p>
<p>7. In future further study will also be needed work out most effective mechanisms making U.S. aid available with maximum flexibility. However U.S. considers it inadvisable continue indefinitely in position supporting inflated import surplus and abnormally high standard living Vietnam as part of support military effort. Reduction over-all costs military would serve double purpose reducing level U.S. aid and reducing artificial import surplus. Vietnam must look forward to day when cost civilian imports supported by receipts civilian exports rather than military in payments. Faster progress this direction must be made than that implied <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>.</p>
<p>8. Advise how cost estimates including force levels were calculated and whether <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> based Vietnamese data or U.S. analysis thereof.</p>
<p>9. Since consideration points raised your 5769 will require further detailed studies, Washington agencies interested Saigon country team considered replies via pouch preceded by cabled summary<note n="5" xml:id="d218fn5">See <ref target="#d227">Document 227</ref>.</note> if you so desire.</p>

<p>8. Saigon 6041 repeated Paris 1507.<note n="2" xml:id="d219fn2"><p>This telegram, June 29, reads as follows:</p>
<p>“<gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Vu Van Mau</persName> told me June 29 in strictest confidence that Cabinet was considering decision to hold referendum with view to deposing <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. Decision, although not yet reached, might be forthcoming soon. I endeavored to explain to <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Mau</persName> advantages both internally and externally to Vietnam if this important constitutional matter were dealt with by an elected assembly, rather than precipitately before govt had completed census, let alone carried out elections.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.)</p></note> We believe potential danger to Free Viet-Nam, if deposition <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> be accomplished by other than legislative forum, is so great that you should talk further with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> personally to attempt to prevent his provoking an incident which might give us all great trouble.</p>
<p>It seems to us, one of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s greatest assets is the potential support of an assembly. Actions taken by such a body would have to be accepted as an expression of national sentiment and not as easily attacked actions of a clique.</p>
<p>Specifically in matter of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s cabinet simply votes deposition and attempts to carry it out they will be in no more sound a legal status than Revolutionary Committee, which has already so voted. Opportunity for competitive rump committees to vote the removal of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> or adopt resolutions favoring Viet Minh or sects will be greatly enhanced. Balance would then rest on comparative military strength rather than on present legality of Government.</p>
<p>United States would have grave difficulty in making effective its aid and support under those circumstances.</p>
<p>While we understand the revolutionary sentiment which impels <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to consider this act, we believe a careful and legally defensible procedure much preferable to course he is considering.</p>
<p>If there are acts by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> or others which appear to make former’s deposition a matter of urgency to avoid serious threat to Free Viet-Nam, we have not been informed by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> of such.</p>

<p>44. 1. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Vu Van Mau</persName> showed me this afternoon July 5 draft of declaration Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> intends to make at noon tomorrow over radio. Draft consisted of two pages of which four-fifths was exposition reasons why Vietnam was not bound by Geneva Accords. Remaining fifth was well-buried statement that government believed in unification and democratic institution of elections provided they were absolutely free. I took position this was very negative document, that it was much less satisfactory than outline he had given me last week (Saigon 6040 to Department repeated Paris 1506, London 55, Ottawa 11, New Delhi 41, Phnom Penh, Vientiane unnumbered<note n="2" xml:id="d220fn2"><ref target="#d217">Document 217</ref></note>) and would make poor impression abroad. I explained at some length why such a declaration should have an affirmative character and suggested it would be well to add a statement of government’s intention hold elections for a representative assembly in South in near future. <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Mau</persName> said he would convey my suggestions to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>
<p>2. When I saw <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> this evening, I repeated to him argument I had made to <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Mau</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, after giving me the standard line about importance of not injuring Vietnamese public opinion by in any way seeming to accept Geneva Accords, ended by saying that <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Mau</persName> had transmitted to him my suggestions, and he found them interesting.</p>
<p>Only tomorrow will tell to what extent, if any, this exercise has succeeded in modifying the proposed statement.<note n="3" xml:id="d220fn3">On the morning of July 6, <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> saw <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Vu Van Mau</persName> and suggested the following revisions in <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s statement, scheduled for release noon that day: removal of detailed criticism of the Geneva Accords, an announcement of national elections in the South, and sequence and wording changes to highlight the positive. <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> also suggested that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> postpone making the statement. (Telegram 56 from Saigon, July 6; Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/7–655) <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> agreed to the postponement. (Telegram 65 from Saigon, July 6; <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>)</note></p>
<p>3. During course of day, <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Mau</persName> had similarly called in British Ambassador, Australian Minister and French Political Counselor. <persName corresp="#p_SSHS1">Stephenson</persName> was very upset by document but particularly because it contained nothing on subject of consultations. He is seeing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> tonight to convey his government’s strong view that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> must take positive position toward this matter, as well as on general subject of Geneva elections.

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>General Problems in Vietnam and Southeast Asia.</item>
</list>
<p>I wish that I could have a full three quarters of an hour with you some time this week to go over a number of troublesome emerging problems in Southeast Asia. It would also be helpful for me if we could take a broad look at the area in terms of what we have been trying to do during the past year, where we stand today, and where we are going. I have asked each of the Officers in Charge in <gloss target="#t_PSA1">PSA</gloss> to analyze their countries in this way.</p>
<p>In particular, Vietnam is entering another “crisis” period. The question of Vietnamese elections is beginning to boil over. The Viet Minh is threatening retaliation. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is defiant, and with much reason. There is a better than even chance that it will come to a head during the summit meetings, and may even be brought to Geneva. The overlap between the Geneva meetings before and after July 20 and the significance of that date in the Geneva Accords practically begs the issue. Even Communist publicity is now adding the party line that there must be strict adherence to the Geneva Accords in Viet-Nam. If the Vietnamese Government has not responded in any way to some form of consultations beginning on or after July 20, I think you should be prepared for a serious diplomatic problem.</p>
<p>The most difficult possibility would be a Soviet motion at the summit or elsewhere to reconvene the Geneva powers to arrange for Vietnamese elections and bring the two parties together. Such a conference might also be asked to take up US military assistance to Cambodia and the problem of the two northern provinces in Laos. Thus, there are three major issues. If the Russians press for some action on the Vietnamese elections question, it may be difficult for the French and the British to resist. The visit of <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> to Peking and Moscow is certainly timed to this issue.</p>
<p>Meanwhile there is nothing but drift, indecision and confusion on our side. The Vietnamese are completely negative and may create an impasse. The British are worried and want something done. The Viet Minh and the Vietnamese will not talk to each other. It is a messy situation. I would suggest that we reconsider four-power consultations in Saigon with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> as soon as the French have an Ambassador <pb xml:id="pg_478" n="478" facs="0508"/>there. I do not believe this has to be at the ministerial level. I think we should consider immediately proposing to <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> that he make this suggestion to his colleagues and to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. In any event, I think we have to continue bolstering <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s position to offset the world press that <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho</persName> is getting from his trip. Consultations in Saigon would help do this.</p>
<p>In general, we are conducting a tremendous amount of activity throughout Southeast Asia. Most of it has some good immediate effects. But I am more and more uncertain of the outcome in the long run. There are disturbing trends in every one of the eight areas in Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>69. Both Foreign Office and British Embassy have continued in last few days to express increasing concern at <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s attitude on making public declaration on elections before July 20. Both had report of first text proposed by <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Mau</persName> for delivery noon July 6 and found it unsatisfactory. They deplored negative approach and absence any reference to pre-July 20 consultations. They expressed opinion that if this text were made public it could only be interpreted by Vietnamese and rest of world as evidence government’s intention not carry out Geneva provisions and that this would have regrettable consequences for all of us.</p>
<p>We have informed both Foreign Office and British of efforts being made by <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> to have text improved. Foreign Office reports that they have been instructing <persName corresp="#p_JGPE1">Jacquot</persName> to use maximum influence on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to make public declaration on consultations and hope this will contribute to desired result but state that they recognize fact that <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> and British Ambassador Saigon undoubtedly wield more influence on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> than they.</p>
<p>British Embassy confirmed again this morning that their position on elections remains that all signatories Geneva have equal responsibility to see that provisions are carried out. They agree with French position that France is only one of signatory powers and therefore has no more responsibility than others in seeing that Viet Minh and <pb xml:id="pg_479" n="479" facs="0509"/>Vietnamese get together. They sympathize with French position that France is not to be considered as representative authority for South Vietnam for purposes of effecting pre-elections discussions. They share French concern that failure to make move toward consultations on or before July 20 may result in terrorist activities and even renewal of hostilities. Finally, they agree with French Foreign Office that if Vietnamese Government does not make satisfactory public declaration of intent or other move toward consultations before July 20 Viet Minh may be expected to file charge with <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and/or Geneva powers accusing French of violating Geneva Agreement. Obvious French answer to this is that Vietnam is now independent country over which France has no control, which it can therefore not oblige to take action against its will and that, therefore, responsibility lies equally with all Geneva signatory powers.</p>

<p>3. Your 5769 requested Washington decision force levels <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> ’56.

Aid request to Congress made basis 100,000 man force. Would be difficult if not impossible to secure additional $150 million for Vietnamese <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> ’56. On other hand Department does not believe under present circumstances aid figure should set exact force levels or that exact force levels should be set primarily by consideration fear inflation or economic dislocations. Recall <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Barrows</persName> stated to <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> Working Group that if procedures could be set up so <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> ’55 program could be carried out without inflation then could handle aid program for ’56 of magnitude support forces costing any figure within range being considered country team Saigon, i.e., $180 to $336 million.</p>
<p>4. Department hopes adequate Vietnamese force levels can be maintained at cost US within limits which will be set by foreign aid appropriation. Possible solution is reduction cost per man which is very high and further refinement of minimum necessary force levels. Will be interested in Embassy and country team report this problem.</p>

<item>“Dear Mr. President:</item>
<item>Please accept my congratulations on completion of your Government’s first year in office. The Nationalist cause under your leadership has successfully met many challenges with fortitude and honor since the trying times of July 1954. It is indeed gratifying that the people and Government of Free Viet-Nam have made such strides in consolidating their independence and in advancing the national reconstruction of the country. All those from the North and the South <pb xml:id="pg_481" n="481" facs="0511"/>who seek true freedom for the individual deserve the tribute of free men everywhere.</item>
<item>I realize that you and your associates still face many urgent and formidable tasks in achieving liberty and unity in the struggle against Communism. We in the United States hope that the goals of the Vietnamese people who believe in genuine freedom can be fulfilled in peace and security.</item>
<item>The support and assistance of the United States for Free Viet-Nam will continue. It can be helpful to the extent that democratic nationalist elements in Viet-Nam are effective and united. I trust that the Government of Viet-Nam under your leadership will continue to consolidate its strength, bring stability and progress to Free Viet-Nam, and develop sound relations with its neighbors in Southeast Asia and its friends throughout the free world.</item>
<item>Many Americans have applauded your resolution and courage during a year of crisis in Viet-Nam. Looking to the future, I hope the Free Vietnamese will continue to rally together for the common good and the execution of national tasks.”</item>

<p>In view importance implications problem French military presence Vietnam, I have with associates reviewed <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> paper and submit following observations:</p>
<p>1. <hi rend="italic">Problem:</hi> Problem has two major aspects, political and military. Military aspects should be broken down into those relating to internal security and those relating to defense against external military aggression.</p>
<p>2. <hi rend="italic">Immediate Vietnamese objective:</hi> Immediate Vietnamese objective as viewed by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is both political and military and is to establish beyond any possible challenge full and complete independence to <pb xml:id="pg_482" n="482" facs="0512"/>control and use Vietnamese armed forces within Free Vietnam. To obtain this aspect of sovereignty <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> wishes French transfer High Command to Vietnamese and desires agreement with French defining mission, status and location of <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>. He wishes furthermore to retain support of French air and navy, as well as French training and logistical elements. In addition, he would probably desire retention of certain <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> ground force combat units if they were confined to mutually agreed bases and charged with mission of contributing to defense of territory against external aggression (which is a highly improbable contingency in light of present French inclinations).</p>
<p>3. <hi rend="italic">Strategic implications—internal security:</hi> Opposed to Vietnamese political and military desiderata are strategic implications arising out of further reduction or complete withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> paper now to some extent overtaken by events. This paper considered it doubtful that <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> in present state preparation and training could continue maintain internal security under prevailing conditions quasi-civil war without assistance of other forces. Successful progress to date of <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> operations against sects and its progressively growing capability contradicts this appreciation. Whether <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> together with <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> security forces will be able to cope at some time in future with possible all-out Viet Minh rising in south is of course function of several unknown factors. Clearly most important of these is Viet Minh underground capability and progress which <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> security forces will have been able to make by date of such rising. Least that can be said in light of current political and particularly military trends in South Vietnam is that relative power ratio is moving in favorable direction. As regards influence continued presence <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> on internal security situation, it is my view that in absence of well defined and mutually agreed understanding with Vietnamese Government <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>’s presence will do more to jeopardize than to improve internal security. To this must be added continually reiterated policy of French command here of non-involvement in internal affairs and its admission that its internal security responsibility extends only to French and other foreign colonies.</p>
<p>4. Strategic implications—external aggression:</p>
<list>
<item>a. As regards external aggression, I believe we must rely at this time on other means than <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> for ground blocking force to retard any Viet Minh military invasion. (<hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Comment:</hi> However, present <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> military planning provides for ground forces within six months which it is estimated will be capable of substantially delaying advance of Viet Minh invasion as well as constituting a significant deterrent to any Viet Minh armed aggression. These ground forces will require outside air and naval support. <hi rend="italic">End <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Comment</hi>)</item>
<item>b. Although continued presence of some French forces in Vietnam would at least avoid psychological vacuum which their sudden <pb xml:id="pg_483" n="483" facs="0513"/>withdrawal would presumably produce, only real deterrent in area at present is Manila Pact.</item>
<item>c. Issue of stationing French forces on or near 17th parallel apart from important policing and control of demarcation line does not appear to have particular strategic importance. Any considerable force deployed on this line in initial stages of any action could be easily outflanked and by-passed through Laos on the west as well as by sea on the East.</item>
</list>
<p>5. <hi rend="italic">Manila Pad:</hi> <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has commented on several occasions, although in vague terms, on possible application of Manila Pact to Vietnam, particularly in face of dangerous internal subversion. France is member of Manila Pact, and it would seem logical that continued presence of <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>, reduced and with clearly established responsibilities, would be useful as patent evidence active French interest in <gloss>SEA</gloss> to complement interests of US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Free World in area. Yet belief is general among Vietnamese, not to mention French, that political climate in France would not permit <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> again to become involved with Viet Minh. It must also be admitted that such involvement would have undesirable political effect on nourishing Viet Minh propaganda and allegations that once again French were fighting Vietnamese in effort to perpetuate their presence in Indo China.</p>
<p>6. <hi rend="italic">Problems facing French:</hi> Major problem French face here in considering reduction or withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> are:</p>
<list>
<item>a. Responsibilities under Geneva Accords for demarcation line and security <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>.</item>
<item>b. Area defense French naval base Saigon.</item>
<item>c. Protection French community Saigon.</item>
</list>
<p>I believe latter problem (c) could be satisfactorily handled from a nearby French base and that actual removal French forces from Saigon proper would tend reduce incidents leading to violence against individual Frenchmen or isolated French residences. Second problem (b) depends in part on willingness Vietnamese to permit French develop naval base at Cap St Jacques or retain security troops Saigon. First problem (a) is more complicated as it depends on willingness Vietnamese to accept, under Article 27 of Geneva Agreement, specific responsibilities undertaken by French High Command. In point of fact, protection <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> should require relatively small number troops if Vietnamese authorities would refrain from encouraging demonstrations against <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and particularly Viet Minh liaison officers. So far they have shown little disposition to do so and in some instances even admit to having provoked them.</p>
<p>7. <hi rend="italic">French intentions:</hi> We are convinced by oft-reiterated statement of French High Command here that they ignorant of Paris intentions with respect to problem retention or withdrawal <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>, and, if former, at what level and with what mission. Presumably, French Government <pb xml:id="pg_484" n="484" facs="0514"/>is now studying problem from financial as well as military and political aspects. It would seem appropriate moment for Department to remind French Government of <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName>’s undertaking at time of Paris talks on Indochina to discuss with US and British question of future of <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> in Vietnam.</p>

<p>1. In our view size of recommended Vietnam military budget should be decided primarily on basis of overall military and political objectives. Since time of formulation governing US policy this question, there have been fundamental changes in situation here of which most important is virtual elimination <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> as major force to deter and resist external aggression.</p>
<p>In our judgement role Vietnam armed forces which was last defined as maintenance internal security should be re-examined. Consequently, we believe re-definition US objectives required before further effort made to refine cost estimates and possible budgets.</p>
<p>2. Following represents our thinking re overall objectives presently feasible and desirable. Because of (a) currently unpredictable future and probable early departure <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>, (b) absence any definite Manila Pact force commitments, (c) increased Viet Minh armed force strength and (d) need for Free Vietnam strength during critical year ahead, a force of 150,000 including integrated sect forces, is considered desirable by July 1, 1956 and for balance of <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1956. (This 150,000 force strength would provide four field divisions of 8500 each, six light divisions of 5500 each and 13 light infantry regiments.)</p>
<p>3. It is believed that (a) initial disposition these forces would deny an invading enemy use of main transport routes and force him to utilize mountain approaches thereby substantially delaying his advance <pb xml:id="pg_485" n="485" facs="0515"/>and (b) existence this blocking force would have significant deterrent effect against Viet Minh aggressive armed action.</p>
<p>4. While conscription and training of young replacements is desirable, we believe unwise for political and military reasons press for conscription until army through attribution [<hi rend="italic">attrition</hi>] begins to reduce below agreed force level. As reserve force of trained men gradually built up, and to extent change in political and military factors permits, we believe eventual further reduction 50,000 level should be sought.</p>
<p>5. Corollary consideration militating in favor 150,000 force goal is problem of demobilization. Difficulties in conforming with original program are due to (a) reluctance of Vietnamese to increase tempo troop reduction because of disrupting effect on armed forces, and fear of adverse political consequences; and (b) interference with demobilization caused by military operations against sects and requirements for pacifying former Viet Minh areas.</p>
<p>6. We greatly appreciate increased allotment and offer following comments re specific points raised in <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 5681; primarily because of delay in carrying out planned construction, military expenditures are running at lower rate than previously estimated. It now appears that US allotment of $234.8 million plus expected Vietnamese contribution will cover actual military expenditures <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1955, even if year end force level should be as high as 150,000 regular armed forces plus 10,000 sect forces. Thus, upward revision goals recommended para 2 above not precluded by financial limitations <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1955. Recognize that main financial problem presented by this proposal will arise in <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1956.</p>
<p>In this connection further study indicates that <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> military costs can be reduced from approximately $2,000 per man per year to $1,843 per man per year. This reduces estimated cost of proposed military budget for 1956 from $336 million to approximately $286 million.</p>
<p>7. We recognize necessity for continuing effort by US elements here to reduce military costs and maximize size and effectiveness of force which can be supported with whatever funds available. Revised figures above are evidence accomplishments this respect. It would be useful to strengthen <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> staff devoted to budget and cost control, and appropriate personnel request will be submitted by <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> through Defense channels.</p>

<p>165. Saigon 8 repeated Paris Hanoi 2 Ottawa New Delhi London 1.<note n="2" xml:id="d229fn2">In this telegram, dated July 1, the Embassy had reported that a recent speech by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> contained additional indication that the government, “if and when it agreed discuss 1956 elections” would probably insist that the United Nations, and not the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>, play a role in the supervision of the electoral process. The Embassy asked for the “Department’s thoughts” on .the desirability and possibility of the United Nations playing such a role in case <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should raise the issue. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.)</note> U.S. position taken at Geneva by General <persName corresp="#p_SWB1">Smith</persName><note n="3" xml:id="d229fn3">For text of the concluding statement made by Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SWB1">Walter Bedell Smith</persName> at the last plenary session at Geneva on July 21, 1954, see <ref target="frus1952-54v16"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, vol. XVI</ref>, p. 1500.</note> was reiteration statement made by President on June 29<note n="4" xml:id="d229fn4">The reference is to a joint <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>–Churchill statement. For text, see <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> p. 1260.</note> that “in the case of nations now divided against their will, we shall continue to seek to achieve unity through free elections, supervised by the United Nations to ensure that they are conducted fairly.” General <persName corresp="#p_SWB1">Smith</persName> further said “with respect to the statement made by the Representative of the State of Viet-Nam,<note n="5" xml:id="d229fn5">The reference is to a statement by <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Tran Van Do</persName> at the last plenary session at Geneva, July 21, protesting the conclusion and conditions of the armistice and reserving for the State of Vietnam complete liberty of action. For text, see Cameron, <hi rend="italic">Viet-Nam Crisis,</hi> vol. I, pp. 309–310.</note> the U.S. reiterates its traditional position that peoples are entitled to determine their own future and that it will not join in any arrangements which would hinder this. Nothing in its declaration just made is intended to or does indicate any departure from this traditional position.”</p>
<p>Regarding <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s position, it is our understanding that no pressures are likely to move him from his policy of refusing to acknowledge the Geneva Agreement as binding upon Viet-Nam, or to see advantage as practical matter of acting under it.</p>
<p>If he should discard Geneva formula and not find some satisfactory substitute, we believe Free Viet-Nam will be in highly vulnerable position, due to Communist pressures and lack of sympathy of many Western and Asian allies.</p>
<p>We have made preliminary study of probable <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> reaction to a proposal that it accept responsibility for supervising pre-election consultations and elections.<note n="6" xml:id="d229fn6">Memorandum from Bacon to <persName corresp="#p_HRE1">Hoey</persName>, July 13, not printed. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/7–1355)</note></p>
<pb xml:id="pg_488" n="488" facs="0518"/>
<p>We assume that such a request would be opposed by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> France India Burma and Indonesia as well as by Communist bloc on the ground that election supervision has already been provided for in Geneva Agreements. <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and French opposition expected to influence Western European votes. If introduced in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> it would fail of adoption. If brought to General Assembly, unlikely required two thirds majority could be obtained in <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> for resolution providing for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> supervision. Above estimate on basis strong U.S. support.</p>
<p>If we are correct in our assumption (and we are making further study<note n="7" xml:id="d229fn7">Memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> to Wainhouse, July 13, and memorandum from Phillips to <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>, July 27, neither printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/7–1355 and 751G.00/7–2755, respectively)</note>) there is virtually no prospect for constructive <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action at this stage. Should also be noted <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> could probably not consider matter until October at earliest unless special session called. <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> special session at this time not desirable for various reasons. Included within possible <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action would be reference to International Court for advisory opinion on extent of Viet-Nam’s obligation under Geneva Accord.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should realize that in view unfavorable prospects <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> appeal reference to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would not remove need for active consideration other solutions.</p>
<p>You should inform <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> of above making certain he understands our support and sympathy and that we are conveying this information to him in an effort to be helpful.</p>
<p>Regarding what advice we can give him under circumstances, we estimate that Geneva formula is unacceptable to Viet-Nam and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> formula is unlikely to eventuate. Therefore remaining course appears to be avoidance any reference to Geneva by name or to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action.</p>
<p>It should be borne in mind that authority given to <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> by Geneva Accord does not include authority for setting up machinery for either pre-election consultations or elections themselves. Therefore if it were decided to accept tacitly existence of <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>, without acknowledging Geneva Accord, there would be no factor limiting Free Viet-Nam’s insisting on additional measures to ensure free elections. This is a point which should be carefully considered by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>
<p>Statement on elections might consist of reference desire Free Viet-Nam see divided territories reunited; acceptability of interzonal elections only under genuinely free conditions; and need to have such free conditions enforced by international action.</p>
<p>You should convey substance above to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>

<p>1.

British Ambassador and French Political Counselor Cerles, to whom I have shown text, agree. <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Mau</persName> said to me that Cabinet had worked on it all last night in effort to meet as far as possible British desires. I limited my suggested changes to recommending that paragraphs numbered 2 and 3 be placed further down in the text between paragraphs 5 and 6 and to recommending that the word “examining” in paragraph numbered 7 be changed to some such term as “considering.” <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Mau</persName> promised to bring these suggestions immediately to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s attention.

<p>2. Text follows. Numbers added for reference purposes.</p>
<list>
<item>Countrymen,</item>
<item>1. The National Government has on several occasions emphasized the value it has always attached to the defense of the country’s unity and of true democracy.</item>
<item>2. We did not sign the Geneva accords.</item>
<item>3. We are in no manner bound by these accords reached against the will of the Vietnamese people.</item>
<item>4. And while our policy is one of peace, no maneuver from any quarter will cause us to stray from our goal: the unity of our country, but unity in freedom and not in slavery. Serving the national cause, we struggle more than ever for territorial reunification. We do not reject the principle of elections as the peaceful and democratic way to achieve such unity.</item>
<item>5. However though elections constitute one of the bases of true democracy, they can have no justification unless they are genuinely free.</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_490" n="490" facs="0520"/>
<item>6. But, faced with the regime of oppression practiced by the Viet Minh, we remain skeptical as to the possibility of obtaining free electoral conditions in the north.</item>
<item>7. We shall not miss any opportunity that would permit the unification of our territory in freedom. But there can be no question of our examining any sort of proposal from the Viet Minh if we are not given proof that they place the higher interests of the national community above those of communism; if they do not renounce terrorism and totalitarian methods; if they do not cease to violate their commitments, as they have done in preventing our countrymen from the north to go to the south, in recently again attacking, in concert with the Communist Pathet Lao, the friendly state of Laos.</item>
<item>8. It is upon us, nationalists, that the mission devolves of reunifying our country, under conditions that are most democratic and effective to guarantee our independence.</item>
<item>9. The free world is with us, of this we are assured.</item>
<item>10. I am certain that I truthfully express the thought of all when I solemnly affirm our will to resist communism.</item>
<item>11. To those who live beyond the 17th Parallel, I ask them to have confidence.</item>
<item>12. With the agreement and the support of the free world, the National Government will bring you independence in freedom.”</item>

<item>The Secretary of State (part of conference)</item>
<item>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Edgar Faure</persName></item>
<item>Mr. Armand Berard</item>
<item>Lt. Colonel Vernon A. Walters</item>
</list>
<p>[Here follows discussion of matters unrelated to Vietnam.]</p>
<p>(Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> rejoined the Conferees)</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> then said he would like to say one word on the subject of Indo-China. The French were worried by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> whom they were trying to support in common with the United States, but he was an extremely difficult man. He had been forewarned of these recent outbreaks.<note n="2" xml:id="d232fn2">Against the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>; see <ref target="#d231fn2">footnote 2, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi></ref>.</note> He had been offered help by the French which he had refused. He felt it would be helpful if the U.S. and France could act in concert to overcome the problems presented by the fact that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was such a difficult person. The second matter was that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> wanted the French out and wanted no collaboration of any kind with them. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> said he was quite willing to withdraw all French troops there, but it must be understood that under those circumstances the French could not be later expected to defend anything. Regarding the elections, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> still had one year before him, but his attitude now was that he was not going to hold them. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> felt that this was not a good idea and that it would be far better if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would give the impression that he intended to hold these elections even if he did not. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> said he received a telegram from <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> criticizing the situation in Viet Nam and protesting against the French failure to provide adequate protection for the International Armistice Commission.</p>
<p>The President said he knew Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was sometimes difficult, but we had been seeking for many years to find a figure who could be directly connected with popular aspirations. We needed someone from this area who could personify for Viet Nam that they were fighting for independence, and regardless of his faults, it would not be helpful to eliminate him as who else could be found. He has achieved independence but he hates the French and this weakens the whole structure. The President did not feel that it would be helpful to attempt to solve this problem by threats to undermine <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, as it would be difficult to find someone who could replace him. The President, while saying he understood Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName>’s difficulties, felt that we did not have a free hand, because if we removed him, communism would triumph. He hoped that the Prime Minister could talk to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> right away, as <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>, who were both very well informed on this situation, were in Geneva. He did not wish to do anything which would embarrass Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> in any way, and he felt that if we handled this matter <pb xml:id="pg_493" n="493" facs="0523"/>skillfully, we would obtain better cooperation from <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> who was admittedly difficult.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> said he had started to talk to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> on this matter and against the advice of some of his councillors, he had decided to support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. It was his desire to carry out a policy of association, not only in Viet Nam, but also in North Africa. He wanted to thank the President for the helicopters which had been given by the United States for use in North Africa. He felt it was very difficult to fight communism unless we could associate ourselves with the national aspirations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> said he felt it would be helpful if the U.S. could intervene with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to get in touch with North Viet Nam on the question of holding the elections and secondly, on the question of the French Expeditionary Corps in Viet Nam if he could be made to rally to a position which the U.S. and French would work out in common. The President said he felt it would be well if this matter could be studied. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> said he would meet with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d232fn3">For a report of that meeting, see <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 64, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</note></p>
<p>The Secretary of State then said we had already pressed <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to take a more positive attitude toward the elections but had not obtained any results. An anomalous situation existed in that the French had signed the Accords, undertaking to hold the elections and that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> who was the party that would hold the elections, had not signed. France had made the undertaking and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> who had the power to carry it out did not want to do so to signify his disapproval of the Geneva agreement.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> said he had discussed this matter with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> who had said that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was against the Geneva agreements, but if there had not been any Geneva agreements, there would not be any Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> commented that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was not always logical.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> then said he felt that his talk with the President had been extremely helpful and he did not wish to detain him any further. He again apologized for arriving late and took leave of the President and the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>4. For Ambassador from Secretary. Ref: <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 64 sent Saigon 3 London 25 Paris 34 New Delhi 6 Ottawa 3.<note n="2" xml:id="d234fn2"><hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note> The 3 Western Delegations agreed today on common instructions regarding their views on the question of consultations and elections in Vietnam. The English text of your instructions is as follows:</p>
<p>“Yesterday, after having taken up the telegram from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> to the two co-Presidents, the Three Western Foreign Ministers discussed the question of the Viet Minh letter to the Vietnamese Government regarding consultations. They have decided to ask their representatives in Saigon to inform President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that their governments believe it advisable that he should not neglect replying to the message which has just been sent to him.</p>
<p>Please take up this subject with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> along the following lines:</p>
<p>The United States Government realizes <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s preoccupations in this matter and understands his position regarding the Geneva accords. It also believes, as he does, that it is necessary to avoid taking any position which would compromise his authority, discourage the Vietnamese people or weaken the nationalist and democratic spirit. Moreover, the United States Government will fully support the Vietnamese Government concerning genuinely free elections, and, consequently, it has no intention of insisting that the Vietnamese Government should automatically accept anything the Viet Minh propose. It seems to us that it would greatly weaken <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s authority were he to seem to be fearful that the Communists would win genuinely free elections in Vietnam. You should point out this is something they have never yet done anywhere.</p>
<p>At the same time it is important not to furnish any motive for Communist subversion in the south, nor any pretext to the Communists to raise the question of Indo-China, particularly elections in Vietnam, at the diplomatic level under conditions which would be unfavorable for the free world. Therefore some Vietnamese response to the authorities of Hanoi is necessary. If it is desired, we of course are ready to study with the Vietnamese authorities the terms of this reply as well as the means by which it would be carried out.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_496" n="496" facs="0526"/>
<p>Similar instructions are being addressed to your French and British colleagues. Please consult with them whether you should present the above position to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> jointly or separately.”<note n="3" xml:id="d234fn3"><p>According to telegram 278 to Saigon, July 25, the Department of State preferred that <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> make the démarche separately. Furthermore, <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> was to point out to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that the three powers understood his position on the Geneva Accords and would insist on “genuinely free elections”; these were positive gains <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> might overlook in his first negative reaction to “being pushed”. (Department of State, Central Files, 396.1–GE/7–225)</p>
<p>According to telegram 428 from Saigon, July 27, the representatives of the three powers made their presentations to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> orally and separately on July 26. It was <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName>’s impression that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was taking the matter in reasonably good grace, although it would be difficult to get him to respond to <persName corresp="#p_PVD1">Dong</persName>’s letter with anything more than a public declaration.

<item>Further to conversation with me this morning.</item>
</list>
<p>1. Regarding the parallel tripartite instructions to Saigon, I am convinced we gained a significant commitment from <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> personally supporting <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, expressing understanding of his difficult internal position, making full allowance for his position on the Geneva Accords, and most important assuring him of French and British support on genuinely free elections. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has wanted such assurances from the French, <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> has reported a number of times, during the past two months. I got those assurances in Geneva and I think that is a worthwhile accomplishment. As far as I can see there is nothing in the joint instructions which is inconsistent with the State Department’s position on elections and consultations. In view of the assurances being given to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> from the French and the British, I did not think at Geneva nor do I now that a joint demarche should be prohibited. I feel that it was better to leave that up to <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName>’s good judgment. I have since seen his telegram No. 375 of <pb xml:id="pg_497" n="497" facs="0527"/>July 23.<note n="2" xml:id="d235fn2">In this telegram, July 23, the Embassy urged that tripartite instructions for representations to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> on elections seek a formula avoiding all reference to the Geneva provisions and allowing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to engage in consultations with the North outside the framework of the Geneva Accords. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 396.1–GE/7–2355)</note> The parallel instructions meet his points. However, neither in Paris nor in Geneva did I go into any detail with the French and British as to what kind of report <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should make to the Viet Minh. Their views coincide with ours that this whole matter of consultations should be stretched out over a long period of time and that there is no need for any direct contacts with the Viet Minh.</p>

<p>The Intelligence Advisory Committee concludes that the immediate aim of the Communist “Democratic Republic of Vietnam” (<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>) is to consolidate its control of the area north of the 17th parallel and to gain control of South Vietnam. Although passive resistance and discontent resulting from harsh control measures and poor economic conditions may increase, the Communist regime will maintain effective control in the North. The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> will continue its present efforts to weaken the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government through subversion, intimidation, and propaganda, and to bring to power in the South men prepared to accept coalition with the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, either before or after nationwide elections.</p>
<p>While the Communists almost certainly would not agree to complex and elaborate safeguards and guarantees, they probably would agree to some form of neutral (but not <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>) supervision of the elections, estimating that such supervision would work to their advantage in the South and, as manipulated, would not adversely affect their position in the north.</p>
<p>Even though it is capable of defeating all military forces, including the French, in South Vietnam as well as in Cambodia and Laos, the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> is not likely to invade either South Vietnam or Laos openly during the period of this estimate. Communist concern for Western, and particularly US reaction arid general considerations arising from overall Bloc policy are deterrents to such attacks. The Communists <pb xml:id="pg_499" n="499" facs="0529"/>now have few assets in Cambodia and will probably be unable to develop a significant internal threat to that country until they have strengthened their positions in Laos and South Vietnam.</p>
<p>The <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> estimates that the resumption of widespread guerrilla activities is unlikely unless the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> should come to the conclusion that South Vietnam can be won only by force. Should the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> decide to use force short of open invasion, it would probably attempt to undermine the Saigon government through sabotage and terror, seeking the formation of a new government amenable to Communist demands for a national coalition.</p>

<p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Fred</persName>: Thank you so much for your letters of July 1 and July 10.<note n="2" xml:id="d238fn2">Neither found in Department of State files.</note> We have now received your telegrams<note n="3" xml:id="d238fn3"><ref target="#d226">Documents 226</ref> and <ref target="#d227">227</ref>.</note> on the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> and the force levels for Viet-Nam, both of which have been extremely useful in getting State, Defense, and <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss><note n="4" xml:id="d238fn4">The Foreign Operations Administration (<gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>) was abolished by Executive Order 10610, July 1, 1955, and replaced by the International Cooperation Administration (<gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>), a semiautonomous organization within the Department of State.</note> to thinking about these problems on the basis of your current views and recommendations. I understand that the people in Defense and <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> are also inclined to a force level of 150,000 for the Vietnamese. <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> also thinks that the funding may not require any additional money for calendar ‘56.</p>
<p>During my week in Paris and my week in Geneva several matters came up which may be of some interest to you and the Embassy:</p>
<p>1. The handling of Indochinese affairs in Paris is undergoing a slow but apparently definite metamorphosis. The Ministry for Associated States is drying up on the vine. <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> and Berard handle Indo-Chinese affairs themselves, particularly Viet-Nam. They consult with <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Jacques Roux</persName> in the Foreign Office but apparently bypass LaForest and Risterucci. It is only a question of time before the responsibility will be turned over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, according to <pb xml:id="pg_500" n="500" facs="0530"/><persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Jacques Roux</persName>, Bill Gibson and Vo Lang.<note n="5" xml:id="d238fn5">Vo Lang was <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Ngo Dinh Luyen</persName>’s Chef de Cabinet.</note> If these three agree, that is probably a pretty solid prophecy. Also, LaForest and his associates seem to be reduced to a rear-guard action in collaboration with <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and his entourage against <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName>. I gather, however, that both the Ministry and the entourage are pretty much “has beens”. It is just a question of time for <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> politically to develop a deal with LaForest.</p>
<p>2. After several talks with <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Jacques Roux</persName>, Berard and one or two with <persName corresp="#p_TFS1">Tomlinson</persName>, I concluded that all of us are pretty much in time on the modalities of Vietnamese consultations and elections. There seems to have been a substantial shift in both the French and British viewpoints during the past two months. They are not insisting on a full-blown consultative conference or opening of talks on July 20th. Instead they are willing to take any small token from <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>—a declaration, a letter through any channel, a series of written exchanges on questions and conditions between the two sides. Their main concern is that some slight movement be made at a leisurely pace. They hope to avoid Viet Minh sabotage and terrorism in the South, charges against them that they are breaking their Geneva obligations, and the ultimate threat of Viet Minh attack under circumstances politically prejudicial throughout the world to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName>. They do not wish to press him into concessions nor do they insist that the two sides reach an agreement and that elections be held. I take it at the working level that the French and British are prepared as we are to see this election trail off indefinitely into the future. The problem is developing as a matter of de facto evolution springing out of the nature of things and accepted all around as the facts of life.</p>
<p>3. I suggested to the Department that <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TFS1">Tomlinson</persName> and I might prepare a brief paper on these various points to put our respective views in conformity. For various reasons that did not work out. It seems to me the best place to do that is in Saigon. You and the Embassy are much closer to the scene and know the whole thing better than we do. One result of the parallel instructions to you and your individual démarches might be to work out the modalities.</p>
<p>4. My mission in Paris and Geneva was somewhat mythical. I was the guardian of silence on the Far East. The Russians never pressed the issue and Bulganin treated it quite perfunctorily in his opening and closing statements. If it had not been for the riots in Saigon I am quite sure nothing would have happened at all at Geneva. That ill-timed incident ignited warm discussions on the side and in the corridors. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> he had a letter from <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> which he wanted to discuss. The British called a meeting of the Foreign <pb xml:id="pg_501" n="501" facs="0531"/>Ministers with <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> present. I reported that in <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 64.<note n="6" xml:id="d238fn6"><ref target="#d233">Document 233</ref>.</note> The French were pretty upset about the whole matter for they felt that they would be charged with negligence by the Communists and the Indians and blamed for the incident by the Vietnamese. They wanted to tell <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> right away that the French would abide by their obligations under Article 25. <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> made no bones about his complete exasperation with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> over this as well as over the <persName corresp="#p_HH1">Hoppenot</persName> business.<note n="7" xml:id="d238fn7">The reference is to a Franco-South Vietnamese difference of opinion over whether the French representative to the State of Vietnam should be styled Ambassador (as the Vietnamese insisted) or High Commissioner (as the French preferred). The compromise worked out in the end was “Ambassador on Extraordinary Mission, High Commissioner of The French Republic to The State of Vietnam”. (Telegram 338 from Paris, July 22; Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/7–2255)</note> Then the <persName corresp="#p_PVD1">Dong</persName> letter led <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> at this moment to launch into quite a long discussion about elections and consultations. I was surprised by the sensible, practical views he expressed. He made it clear he does not expect elections to be held but felt <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should declare views on really free elections. <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> said France would support him in this. <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> also said that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s repudiation of Geneva was a great asset for us. It was really just a question of tactics in playing this matter so as not to provoke the other side. Therefore he felt <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should make some response or make some contact with the Viet Minh. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> agreed strongly and felt that the three ministers should urge <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> into consultations. The Secretary made two points, all in French. He first pointed out the internal morale problem that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has, as you have reported it. Both <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> seemed to be fully aware of this problem and acknowledged it without reservation. Secondly, the Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should have assurances of support from the three of us if we were going to ask him to make any kind of response to the Viet Minh. <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> both agreed this was an excellent idea and <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> strongly concurred, his only contribution to the hour’s meeting. The ministers then decided instructions should be drafted to their representatives in Saigon. <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> suggested a joint démarche. I suggested to the Secretary that we have been successfully proceeding with individual contacts and that it would be better for us to keep our freedom of action. <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> then agreed that it would be better to leave this up to the three of you in Saigon. During this meeting and in my drafting of the parallel instructions with <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> there was no discussion of the substance or of the timing of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s reply to the Viet Minh. The French were greatly concerned that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would reject the <persName corresp="#p_PVD1">Dong</persName> letter out of hand before the three Western powers could get to him.</p>

<p>5. I had no trouble at all drafting the parallel instructions—<gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 67.<note n="8" xml:id="d238fn8">Printed as telegram 4 to Saigon, <ref target="#d234">Document 234</ref>.</note> <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> wrote it out in French from a list of points I had made and agreed heartily on the paragraph of assurances to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. The ministers concurred in our draft with only one or two minor editorial changes. The Secretary added a couple of sentences about the Communists not winning elections, and off went the telegram. I was somewhat concerned about our joining with the French and British in pressing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to make an answer but from our point of view it seemed we should at least ask this of him. We are worried in Washington about Viet Minh capabilities of subversion and sabotage and the Vietnamese capacities for resisting. At the same time I felt this was a moment in Geneva to obtain the assurances from the French and the British as well as an understanding and sympathy for him and for his position. I hope this will help your handling of this delicate problem with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> and his government. There must be an atmosphere of reciprocal confidence if the extremely delicate operation during the next year is to succeed.</p>
<p>Your telegram 428 of July 27<note n="9" xml:id="d238fn9">Not printed, but see footnote 3, <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi></note> indicates that this matter came off all right in the first instance. We hope that our present line and the formulas to develop will keep the issue of consultations and elections from getting very hot.</p>
<p>6. Berard talked to me in Geneva about the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>. He indicated the French are undecided how far to cut the French forces in Viet-Nam and wondered what our thinking was. They are deliberating over two choices: 1) a reduced force of about 20,000 including air, navy, and ground, instructors and logistic support, or 2) total reduction of all French forces from Viet-Nam all except possibly instructors for the <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss>. He said there was great pressure in Paris particularly in political circles to get all French forces out of Viet-Nam right away. He stated that he and <persName corresp="#p_FE1">Faure</persName> were inclined to the first alternative. If that were the final decision, French forces would be removed from metropolitan areas in any event. I told him that we had no high level opinion of the question but that we would be agreeable to whatever the French and Vietnamese worked out. Our main concern was to insure the retention of enough instructors to help us with the <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> training and to advise the <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss>.</p>
<p>7. I met with the High Commissioner in Paris to assure him we were not talking about Viet-Nam or the Far East in Geneva. I also had several talks with [name deleted] in Geneva. He showed me his files on many subjects. He possesses an earnest set of eyes and ears for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> in Paris and no doubt he sees and hears a lot. <pb xml:id="pg_503" n="503" facs="0533"/>Judging by the correspondence he appears to have with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, he is quite a source of information.</p>

The Embassy questioned the wisdom of such an approach and expressed the fear that unless the United States discussed the matter with the French, it could be accused of assisting and encouraging the Vietnamese.

</list>
<p>Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, Indochina, with the concurrence of the Ambassador and the Director, <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>, has recommended an increase in the authorized strength of Vietnamese armed forces to 150,000 for the balance of the calendar years 1955 and 1956. Such an increase will require substantial additional direct forces and defense support funds for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 56. Accordingly, it is requested that you submit your comments <pb xml:id="pg_504" n="504" facs="0534"/>on and recommendations concerning the Vietnamese force bases proposed by <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Indochina.<note n="8" xml:id="d239fn8">See <ref target="#d247">Document 247</ref>.</note></p>
<p>In so doing, it is requested that you consider and present your views upon the following points:</p>
<list>
<item>a. Any changes in the military situation resulting from the reduction of the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> during the past year and the probable future phase-out of most French Union ground forces.</item>
<item>b. The capability of the Viet Minh for subversive and paramilitary activities in Free Vietnam and the probability of their exercising those capabilities within the next year.</item>
<item>c. The <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> strength required to (1) permit politically-necessary integration of some sect forces; (2) continue military operations against Binh Xuyen and dissident Hoa Hao elements; (3) contain the remaining sect forces; and (4) contain Viet Minh underground capability discussed in response to paragraph b above.</item>
<item>d. The speed with which <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> forces could be demobilized without seriously affecting the efficiency of the army or greatly aggravating the existing internal security problem.</item>
<item>e. The organization and functions of any <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> forces in excess of the presently planned three field and three territorial divisions.</item>
<item>f. The effect of any increase in force levels upon the availability of excess stocks of military equipment for trans-shipment from Indochina.</item>
</list>
<p>In connection with point e it should be noted that existing U.S. national policy calls for supporting Vietnamese forces needed to maintain internal security, but not those designed to check external aggression. Accordingly, while the desirability of building up forces, such as the three existing field divisions, with a potential capability of deterring aggression and delaying any Viet Minh advance is recognized, such a mission must be thoroughly justified in the light of changed military circumstances if it is to be acceptable to U.S. Government authorities.</p>
<p>In order that no time may be lost in arriving at a decision on the size of the Vietnamese forces to be supported, the Department of Defense has already requested<note n="9" xml:id="d239fn9">In telegram <gloss target="#t_Def1">DEF</gloss> 985882 to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>, July 29.

<p>“I consider it most necessary that mission Vietnamese forces include potential capability of deterring aggression and delaying Viet Minh attack for same reasons stated Saigon 186 [<ref target="#d227">Document 227</ref>] and because later implications Manila Pact.

<p>Req early approval of increase in auth strength of Vietnamese armed forces to 150,000 plus 10,000 sect forces for bal of <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 55, 150,000 incl sect forces by 1 Jul 56 and for bal of <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 56.

Justification in order of points contained in referenced <gloss target="#t_DEPTAR1">DEPTAR</gloss> msg follows:</p>
<p>A. Fol changes in mil situation have resulted fm reduction of <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> during past year and the probable future phase out of most French Union ground forces: (<hi rend="italic">Note</hi>: French strength 1 Aug 55—approx 60,000 fol evacuation of 12,500 in Jul. Planned strength for 1 Oct 55—35,000).</p>
<list>
<item>(1) Virtual elimination of the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> as a force to deter and resist aggression. Three major factors support this:
<list>
<item>(a) French lack of incentive is evidenced by repeated statements by French officials to effect that “never again will we fight, on our own, either the Viet Minh or Vietnamese except in self defense.” French can see no future in sacrificing French lives in a country that is outside the French empire. There is a probability that French could and would contribute <pb xml:id="pg_507" n="507" facs="0537"/>air and naval spt to combatting Viet Minh over aggression if subj French forces were committed under <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> auspices.</item>
<item>(b) Increased pressure by Vietnamese govt on French to withdraw all mil forces. It is expecting that for the coming Vietnamese-French negotiations will see the Vietnamese govt requesting a phased French withdrawal of all forces except a tng msn, with all ground forces withdrawn by 1 Apr 56 and air and naval forces by 31 Dec 56.</item>
<item>(c) French need for ground forces elsewhere, primarily N Africa, and the fact that the French govt has given indications of favoring early evacuation of French forces fm IndoChina, limited in time only by mil requirements for properly planned and efficiently implemented mil evacuation. Despite probability French troops would not actively oppose Viet Minh aggression, nevertheless French force constitutes a deterrent to Viet Minh aggression. Elimination of this deterrent would increase possibility of Viet Minh attack unless otherwise offset by compensating deterrent factor associated with Vietnamese forces.</item></list></item>
<item>(2) There will soon be no force in Vietnam capable of blocking external aggression sufficiently long to allow arrival of outside aid and the mobilization of additional Vietnamese forces. It is believed a Vietnamese force of 150,000 properly organized and trained and supported by avail French navy and air would have this blocking and delaying capability.</item>
<item>(3) French withdrawal has resulted in only a token French force manning the NE border of Free Vietnam. If Viet Minh are to be denied free access to S Vietnam and the capability to build up Viet Minh subversive strength almost at will, local forces must be employed to guard the extensive borders.</item>
</list>
<p>B. The capability of the Viet Minh for subversive and paramilitary activities in Free Vietnam and probability of their exercising those capabilities within next year are as fol:</p>
<list>
<item>(1) Viet Minh have capability of
<list>
<item>(a) Small unit to <gloss target="#t_bns1">bn</gloss> size guerrilla raiding and harassing operations and</item>
<item>(b) Clandestine terrorist attacks on installations and persons throughout S Vietnam.</item></list></item>
<item>These capabilities can be exercised on either sporadic or phased and cumulative basis. Reference capability (a), it is impossible to estimate accurate strength but Viet Minh can put armed forces of light battalion strength (250) into the field in rough terrain. Viet Minh can dominate areas in the foot hills and high ground in central Vietnam, hold trails in plateau area, hold trails along Laotian border for forces invading through back door, maintain <gloss target="#t_bns1">bn</gloss> forces along east bank of southern Mekong River and in the Plain des Joncs area. Viet Minh are in the process of organizing an intricate system of para-military and subversive elements throughout Free Vietnam. They have capability of increasing their underground forces three-fold over a six month period and can block all active support of the govt in all areas <pb xml:id="pg_508" n="508" facs="0538"/>except the large cities unless strong counter action is taken by army or police. Ref capability (b), Viet Minh terrorist activities currently directed by psychological, political intimidation, military Viet Minh possess covert orgn and means at any time to step up terrorist activities to point where it could seriously reduce confidence, prestige, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> govt, both at home and abroad. Above two capabilities can be exercised separately or together or in conjunction with overt mil attack.</item>
<item>(2) The Viet Minh will probably confine their para-military activities to resisting efforts of Vietnamese natl army to destroy them until either hope of diplomatic or electoral victory in Jul 56 is denied them or a decision to attack militarily is made. Whenever conditions indicated that Jul 56 will not see a Viet Minh victory, the para-military forces will probably be heavily augmented in preparation for extensive guerrilla activity, and a clandestine terrorist campaign will be initiated.</item></list>
<p>C. The size of the Vietnamese national army necessary to maintain internal security is dependent in large measure on the popular spt given Free Vietnamese government. Popular spt is, in turn, largely dependent on size and capability of Vietnamese natl army. Internal security will never be firmly established until the people are willing to take individual and community action against Viet Minh and dissident elements. People will only act when fear of Viet Minh retaliation by either underground agents or external aggression is replaced by confidence that their govt has power to protect them and ensure their ultimate survival. With early withdrawal of French ground forces and in absence of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> force commitments, Vietnamese must rely on themselves to produce ground forces necessary to delay external aggression. When considered in this realistic manner, the forces required to establish and maintain internal security must incl force for delaying action. A Vietnamese natl army force of 10 divs (4 fld and 6 light) and 13 territorial regts, with a strength of 142,000 and stationed so that all areas of Free Vietnam are covered by military forces, is required to establish and maintain internal security in the true sense of the words. Force will permit planned integration of sect forces, continuance of operations against rebel elements, containment of remaining sect forces and in conjunction with effective civil security or police forces, the suppression and containment of both the para-military and the clandestine terrorist capability.</p>
<p>D. The following factors affect the speed with which Vietnamese natl army forces could reasonably be demobilized:</p>
<list>
<item>(1) Vietnamese Natl Army has already undergone a sizeable reduction since the Geneva truce.</item>
<item>(2) The Viet Minh have increased their forces from 341,000 on 20 Jul 54 to 367,000 at present; with the battle corps increasing from 147,000 to 250,000. (Latest reliable intelligence reports.)</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_509" n="509" facs="0539"/>
<item>(3) Free Vietnam faces a continuing war against the sects and the constant threat of subversive and/or guerrilla activities.</item>
<item>(4) Due to inexperience and lack of necessary machinery for demobilization and need for psychological adjustment of populace, it is considered physically impossible to demobilize below 150,000 and still retain any semblance of an effective force.</item>
<item>(5) Demobilization would add to recruiting potential of Viet Minh and sect elements and aggravate economic and internal security situation. In view of these factors, Vietnamese Natl Army speed of demobilization is considered to be: Reduce fm present strength of 146,000 plus sects to 142,000 including sects by 1 Jul 56. This strength to continue through remainder of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 56. Impossible to estimate beyond 31 Dec 56, but reduction during that period must be considered in light of then existing situation.</item>
</list>
<p>E. The increased strength of Vietnamese Natl Army will add 1 fld and 3 light divs plus 13 territorial regts to presently auth 3 fld and 3 light div force. Functions are as fol:</p>
<list>
<item>(1) The 13 regts will assume basic mission of internal security originally planned for the 3 light divs. They will be trained as both a counter-subversive and a combat force and will form nucleus for 4 add combat divs when a civil police and security orgn is ready to relieve them of msn of ferreting out enemy’s clandestine orgn and to assist in suppression of small size enemy para-military activities.</item>
<item>(2) The add 3 light divs and the 3 original light divs (reld of primary msn of internal security by 13 territorial regts) to have function of augmenting internal security forces in establishing and maintaining internal security. The 6 light divs stationed in key areas throughout S Vietnam, will give the Vietnamese a reasonably strong force that can be moved quickly into any trouble area with the ability to take repressive and retaliatory measures against Viet Minh and/or sect activities and through their presence offer a deterrent to Viet Minh disturbances. In case of external aggression the light divs can augment the delaying forces. The presence of these divs forms a base for favorable political action.</item>
<item>(3) The add fld div gives balance to the Vietnamese Natl Army and will have the function of adding its forces to third echelon of defense against internal aggression and first echelon of defense against external aggression as required and allowed by situation.</item>
</list>
<p>F. Determination of a finite answer is to the effect the requested increase in force levels would have on the availability of excess stocks of mil equip in S Vietnam is affected by the facts that [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] (1): Excess property reports to date have been based on a <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> estimate of a possible Vietnamese troop strength of 150,000 and</p>
<p>(2): There is much salvage or unserviceable property that cannot be applied against requirements of any size force. However it is estimated that the requested force strength increase will raise requirements approximately as fol: Gen purpose vehicles—20%; Weapons (individual)—35%; Ammunition—35%.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_510" n="510" facs="0540"/>
<p>In general, requirements for the requested increase can be met with stocks on hand, with sufficient stocks remaining to satisfy needs of Laos and Cambodia and making available to other Vietnam govt agencies the necessary weapons and equip to provide for a civilian security force of not exceeding 25,000; should such a force be decided upon.</p>
<p>It is my seriously considered view that Free Vietnam is at the critical point in its fight for freedom. The foundation has been laid for a strong government and society which offers opportunity for developing the loyalty of its citizens to the point where partisan warfare or resistance against the internal as well as external invader will be accepted as every man’s duty and obligation. The Vietnamese people are ripe for an active change away from the Viet Minh and toward the Free Vietnamese government. A position of military strength is basic to the attitude necessary for popular support of the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> govt. Present circumstances and attitudes dictate unequivocally that a Free Vietnam armed strength of 150,000 through <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 56 is the minimum for the job to be done.</p>

<p>Lt Gen <persName corresp="#p_OD1">O’Daniel</persName>, perhaps more than any other individual, has a keen understanding and immense appreciation of the situation in Indochina to include an intimate knowledge of the Vietnam will and ability to succeed. I repose the utmost confidence in his judgment and consider that prompt and full support in implementing his recommendations will be in the best US interest. I specifically refer to his closing comments commencing “It is my seriously considered view, etc,”. I endorse this view and urge that this be the overriding consideration in approval action on his recommendations.</p>
<p>Specific comments referring lettered paras referenced <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss> msg fol: Paras A, C, D, and E are adequately covered in my interim reply and <gloss target="#t_ChMAAG1">ChMAAG</gloss> Indochina’s recommendations. . . . Following is also pertinent: The Viet Minh are capable of: A. Undermining the stability of the Vietnam Govt and B. of aiding an overt invasion by Viet Minh military forces, through subversion and para military activities, by instigating large scale disturbances, interdictions, sabotage, espionage, and large scale industrial trouble and uprisings. The back bone of the Viet Minh subversive effort was left behind at time of withdrawal of Viet Minh military forces beyond the 17th parallel. For the foreseeable future, it is estimated that Viet Minh will concentrate on subversion, by creating unrest and sabotage efforts to improve its position and accomplish capability A above and to lay the groundwork for aiding an invasion if and when it comes. There is no Communist party or front group operating overtly in South Vietnam, although Viet Minh political activity is widespread in the rural areas in the form of cells, sport groups, farmers associations, etc. The Viet Minh political apparatus in the south will necessarily undergo some reorganization as the situation changes.</p>
<p>In addition, following details advise as to dissident sects in Vietnam and point up forces necessary for their containment: The Hoa Hao forces in Southwest Vietnam under control of <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName> number approx 2000. This number could be increased to over 6000 if the forces formerly under control of <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> and <persName>Nguyen</persName> were integrated. The <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> is at present employing approx 20000 troops against the Hoa Hao. This number is broken down into 6 groupments, 1 regiment and 2 artillery <gloss target="#t_bns1">bns</gloss>. The Binh Xuyen forces number approx 3000 located south of Saigon in the Long Thanh–Baria area. 1800 of these forces are trained military pers. As many as 11 <gloss target="#t_bns1">bns</gloss> of approx 6000 troops of the <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> have been employed against the Binh Xuyen, but at present there is no organized force being employed. A small number of small naval craft of the <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> navy are available in this area. The <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> originally numbered approx 30000 troops, of whom all but 7000 are reported to have integrated in the <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> is not opposing the <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> at this time. Approx 10000 Viet Minh are reported scattered throughout all of Vietnam.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_512" n="512" facs="0542"/>
<p>Reference para F: Generally speaking, <gloss target="#t_ChMAAG1">ChMAAG</gloss>’s comments are correct in saying that the majority of <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> equipment required for these forces can be provided from excesses. However, it must be recognized that shortages of considerable magnitude will exist in requirements for certain selected line items: Mainly electronics and some individual equipment, some of which are costly items. The dollar total involved, although not insignificant, is relatively minor when considered in relation to the overall cost of <gloss target="#t_MDA1">MDA</gloss> programs for the Associated States and in comparison to the <gloss target="#t_DFS1">DFS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DS1">DS</gloss> costs involved which represent by far the major dollar cost of this force to the US.</p>
<p>The following is also applicable: Additional costs of forces as proposed should be funded without jeopardizing the proposed programs for other countries in the <gloss target="#t_PACOM1">PACOM</gloss>. Magnitude of the cost not clear, however, as Vietnam operating on budget with deficit largely underwritten by US, it appears that total cost of support of all additional forces must be borne by US. Further, value of <gloss target="#t_MDA1">MDA</gloss> material excess to 100,000 man force has been considered as being available to satisfy approved requirements in other countries and entire programming process based on this concept.</p>

<p>The Department of Defense again is attempting to obtain from the Department of State concurrence to the assignment of personnel to <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, Saigon, in excess of the 342 ceiling at the time of the Geneva Settlement.</p>
<p>Defense thinking appears to be as follows:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) The United States should not “gratuitously place restrictions on the manner in which it chooses to carry out the replacement of military personnel under the 342 ceiling.”</item>
<item>(b) Personnel on <gloss target="#t_TDY1">TDY</gloss> to <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> regardless of duration of such duty should not be considered as part of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> strength.</item>

<p>Although a memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName><note n="2" xml:id="d243fn2">A copy of this memorandum to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>, May 23, is attached to a memorandum from Brigadier General J.K. White, Director, Office of Military Assistance Programs, Department of Defense, to Robert C. Hill, Special Assistant to the Secretary of State for Mutual Security Affairs, July 13. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.5–MSP/7–1355)</note> states that our Embassy at Saigon concurs in his recommendations, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRA1">Randolph Kidder</persName>, who was Chargé at that time, states that the position of the Embassy was that it could not concur in the absence of Department policy guidance.</p>
<p>In view of the assurances you gave Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> in Paris last December and our belief that at this time we should not invite criticism from the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and our allies by our disregard for the spirit and intent of the Geneva settlement,<note n="3" xml:id="d243fn3">This was the view of members of the Legal Adviser’s Office of the Department of State, according to a memorandum from Katherine B. Fite and John P. Furman to Purnell of <gloss target="#t_PSA1">PSA</gloss>, July 26, also attached to the memorandum from White to Hill, July 13.</note> I believe we should assume that military personnel assigned to <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and in Viet-Nam, no matter what their designation, should be within the 342 ceiling. In answering the Department of Defense inquiry,<note n="4" xml:id="d243fn4"><p>On August 12, <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> replied to the memorandum by General White, July 13, as follows:</p>
<p>“The Department of State cannot approve in toto the guide lines set forth in the letter from Chief, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, Saigon, attached to Department of Defense Memorandum of July 13, 1955.</p>
<p>“In order to avoid inevitable accusations of purposefully trying to sabotage the Geneva Settlement, it is believed United States policy with regard to <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> personnel should be such that the number of military personnel actually present in Indochina at any given time should not exceed 342 persons, the number called for in the table of organization at the time the Geneva Accord was signed.</p>
<p>“Military personnel, including mobile training teams assigned on temporary duty mentioned in your memorandum of April 25, 1955, would appear to fall within the overall numerical limitation. Military personnel not actually present in Viet-Nam, whether carried on Saigon rolls or not, need not be charged against the 342 maximum. Replacement overlaps which result in personnel excess over the ceiling should not be encouraged. However, overlaps when considered essential to the effectiveness of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> operations and if held to the shortest possible duration might be justified.</p>
<p>“While there may develop some flexibility in the interpretation of the Geneva Accord with respect to United States military personnel, since such personnel is not specifically covered by the Agreement and the United States is not a signatory, it is believed desirable that we pursue at this time a policy which accommodates the spirit of the Geneva Settlement.” (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.5–MSP/7–1355)</p></note> I should appreciate your guidance and comment on our proposed answer which is as follows:</p>
<list>
<item>a) We cannot approve the Department of Defense suggested guide lines in toto.</item>
<item>b) To avoid accusations of purposefully trying to sabotage the Geneva Settlement, military personnel actually present in Viet-Nam should not exceed the 342 ceiling.</item>
<item>c) Military personnel assigned but not actually present need not be counted against the ceiling.</item>
<item>d) Overlaps when essential and of short duration might be justified.</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_514" n="514" facs="0544"/>
<item>e) Some flexibility may later evolve but at this time it appears desirable to pursue a policy which can accommodate the spirit of the Geneva Settlement.</item>

<p rend="center">U.S. POLICY IN THE EVENT OF A RENEWAL OF AGGRESSION IN VIETNAM</p>
<p>1. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action 1415, June 9, 1955 noted that U.S. policy in the event of a renewal of hostilities by the Communists in Vietnam would be governed by the provisions of paragraph 5–d of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5429/5 pending a review of that paragraph by the Planning Board. Paragraph 5–d of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5429/5 reads:</p>
<list><item>“In the event of Communist overt armed attack in the area covered by the Manila Pact prior to the entering into effect of the Pact, take actions necessary to meet the situation, including a request for authority from Congress to use U.S. armed forces, if appropriate and feasible. When the Pact is in effect, be prepared to oppose any Communist attack in the Treaty area with U.S. armed forces if necessary and feasible, consulting the Congress in advance if the emergency permits.”</item></list>
<p>2. There is a possibility that the Vietminh, possibly in connection with the election issue, may embark on a course of more forceful action against South Vietnam. While such action might take the form of infiltration and insurrection within South Vietnam, it could also take the form of overt aggression across the armistice line. In the light of this possibility, and in connection with the review of paragraph 5–d of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5429/5, it is necessary to consider what action the U.S. should take in the specific case of such overt aggression. Key factors bearing on this decision include U.S. capabilities for action in relation to the aggressor’s capabilities, as well as the implications and effects of such action at home and abroad, including the deterrent effect of a U.S. decision to intervene against the aggressor. These key factors should be the subjects of special studies as outlined in greater detail below.</p>
<p>3. The studies should be based on the following assumptions, which are for planning purposes only:</p>
<list>
<item>a. It is the objective of the U.S. to deter possible Vietminh aggression against Vietnam or, in the event such aggression takes place, to intervene swiftly and decisively, in a manner and on a scale best calculated to avoid the hostilities broadening into general war.</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_516" n="516" facs="0546"/>
<item>b. The Vietminh attack is by overt armed forces across the armistice line, of such a character that it can clearly be labeled as aggression and is generally regarded as such by free world opinion.</item>
<item>c. South Vietnam is developing and can continue to develop the necessary strength referred to in paragraph 2 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5519, i.e., strength “to deter or defeat Vietminh insurrections in its territory, to impose and sustain order in its territory, and to win a free election limited to its own zone and held under its own auspices and control.”</item>
<item>d. Although the Manila Pact is invoked, the French Expeditionary Corps takes no part in the fighting aside from such action as may be necessary for its own protection, and other signatories of the Pact provide only minor military contributions, thus leaving the main burden on the forces of South Vietnam and the U.S.</item>
<item>e. South Vietnam forces are of the same strength as at present.</item>
<item>f. Vietminh capabilities are as estimated in <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 63.1–55.<note n="7" xml:id="d244fn7">See <ref target="#d237">Document 237</ref>.</note></item>
<item>g. Communist China does not intervene with military forces, except possibly in the event of para. 4–a(2) below, but provides aid to the Vietminh in the form of supplies.</item>
</list>
<p>4. The following specific but brief studies should be prepared as promptly as possible:</p>
<list>
<item>a. By Defense and <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, a study (to be completed by September 15 or as soon thereafter as practicable) of U.S. military operations required—with the use of nuclear weapons and alternatively without such use—(1) to repulse the aggression and punish the aggressor or (2) to destroy the Vietminh forces and take control of North Vietnam. This study should indicate the nature and duration of operations, the forces and logistic support required and their availability, and the effects upon other U.S. military commitments. Preparatory military steps which might be taken, both as preparation for action and as a deterrent through manifestation of U.S. capability and resolve to intervene swiftly and effectively, should also be indicated.</item>
<item>b. By State, a study of the political and economic measures which would be required in support of the operations in a above, including preparatory steps which might have a deterrent effect.</item>
<item>c. By <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, an estimate of the deterrent effect on the Communists of a known U.S. decision to intervene against Vietminh aggression.</item>
<item>d. By <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss>, a study of the mobilization requirements for support of the actions in a above.</item>
</list>
<p>5. In addition, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> should review and consolidate estimates of the effects of U.S. failure to intervene in the event of overt, armed attack by the Vietminh across the armistice line.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Revision in Force Levels and Costs for Vietnamese Military Forces</item>
</list>
<p>The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> will soon be considering a proposal from the country team Saigon for a force level for the Vietnamese armed forces of 150,000.<note n="2" xml:id="d245fn2">For the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> comments, see <ref target="#d247">Document 247</ref>.</note> This would represent an increase of 50,000 above the level recommended by the <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> Mission.</p>
<p>Several factors point to the need for increased forces for Vietnam:</p>
<list>
<item>1. French forces in Vietnam are being reduced faster and to a lower level than anticipated.</item>
<item>2. Absence of any definite Manila Pact force commitments. However, a force of 150,000 in South Vietnam would increase capabilities to delay any Viet Minh advance in the initial stages of any invasion from the North, and constitute a significant deterrent to such armed invasion.</item>
<item>3. Need for Free Vietnam strength in year ahead. One of the principal supports of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has been the national army. The previous schedule of rapid demobilization in order to bring the force level down to 100,000 proved to be impossible because of the unforeseen open warfare with the sects, the need to integrate additional sect forces into the national army, and the problem of resettling discharged military personnel and their dependents. In addition, an increased force might be able to take care of any Viet Minh armed uprising in the South, and would certainly continue the trend toward a relatively more favorable power ratio in the South.</item>
</list>
<p><gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Saigon estimates that a force level of 150,000 in 1956 will cost $80 to $100 million more than a force of 100,000 was estimated to cost. Provided the original request for 1956 funds for Vietnam was not cut, the additional requirement for funds for the Vietnamese forces could be met from existing appropriations, if the following were earmarked for Vietnam:</p>
<list>
<item>1. $50 million the Administration requested from Congress for the French forces in Indochina. This fund should be transferred to the support of the Vietnamese forces, which will now be performing the function originally envisaged for the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>. At present, <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> is <pb xml:id="pg_518" n="518" facs="0548"/>considering using these funds as part of a reserve fund for Asia as a whole.</item>
<item>2. $25 to $40 million carryover of unspent balances obligated for support of the Vietnamese army in calendar year 1955 (<gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 funds).</item>
<item>3. $3 to $35 million carryover of unspent balances obligated for support of the Vietnamese army in calendar year 1954 (<gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 funds).</item>
</list>
<p>In addition, if necessary, financing the Vietnamese forces could be converted from a calendar year 1956 to a fiscal year 1956 basis. The foundation for such a change was laid in the Congressional testimony, and would reduce the needs for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 funds by approximately $100 million. However, if such a change were made, it would have to be presented in a way not to give the Vietnamese the impression we were planning aid only up to June 30, 1956,—20 days prior to the Geneva date for nation-wide free elections.</p>
<p>If it is decided that sufficient justification exists to reduce aid to the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> below the $100 million figure now obligated for that purpose, those funds could be reprogrammed for other purposes. Therefore, it is not necessary to await a decision on the issue of aid to the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> in 1955 in order to express our support for a higher force level in Vietnam.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation:</p>

<p>The President spoke of the current census and stated that it had a dual purpose: first, the preparation for the anticipated elections in south Viet Nam and, second, for conscription. He said that the Army, which was slightly larger than 150,000, now would be reduced to that number and that there was a need to bring in “fresh blood”, so as to relieve some of the older men who had extensive family obligations. He felt that conscription after the census would make this possible.</p>

Both had extensive financial resources which they had extorted from the peoples. <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said, possesses hundreds of millions of piasters from his revenues in connection with the drug trade, prostitution and other forms of vice. He is still in control of a section of the river somewhat downstream from Saigon.</p>
<p>At the present time <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has some regiments deployed against <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Tran Van Soie</persName>. He feels that as soon as he obtains sufficient naval craft he will be able to eliminate <persName corresp="#p_LVVBV1">Bay Vien</persName>. The naval craft presumably would come from the French.</p>
<p>As for communist strength in the countryside, he believes it has been reduced by some 50 percent.</p>
<p>In connection with the Western provinces previously controlled by <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Tran Van Soie</persName>, that is, the Hoa Hao the Prime Minister said that he had visited these areas and that he was appalled by what he had seen. He said that neither in the north nor the central areas of Viet Nam was there any situation to compare with it—so thoroughly and so completely had the peoples in the Western provinces been exploited. In his view, the dissidents could no longer count on any support to speak of from the indigenous inhabitants of that area.</p>
<p>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> spoke of a French parliamentary mission headed by Ferdinand Dupont (?) who came to Saigon at his invitation to consider the plight of French nationals still in the country. In an oral report the Commission said that there were three types of French residents in Viet Nam at the present time: (1) Those whose business and skills were still needed in Viet Nam and who could make a living. For them the Commission concluded the best thing would be to stay on; (2) the small proprietors, dance hall, bar cabaret and restaurant operators and retailers who had developed out of the colonial economy and who now found themselves without customers. The Commission felt that the answer for them was to pull up stakes and go back home to France. Some were taking the step; others were reluctant to do so; and (3) the petty functionaries who had had jobs in <pb xml:id="pg_520" n="520" facs="0550"/>the French colonial service and who were now without employment. They apparently are reluctant to go home, but the Commission thinks that this is their only answer. They have no particular skills, no particular abilities, at least no trained abilities, and as long as they remain in Viet Nam they are receiving some help from the French Government in the form of social security.</p>
<p>As for the second type discussed above and to some extent the third type, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> felt that the Commission’s conclusion that they should go home was sound. He pointed out that some were taking to illegal practices, getting involved in the drug trade, robbing, etc. and this was likely to increase as time went on. He said that they were already arresting several a week.</p>
<p>As for the French army. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said that it was being phased out in Indochina. He expected that it would be down to 30,000 by next March. He had no objections to the French navy and air forces remaining. On the contrary, he believed they should remain to conduct the training of comparable Vietnamese forces. He pointed out that the French dilemma was that it was a guarantor of the Geneva armistice which made it necessary for them to keep troops in the country to carry out its terms. And yet France was committed to the withdrawal of its troops. This dilemma apparently remained, and he offered no solutions.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s chief concern with the French military forces appeared to center on <gloss target="#t_G1">G</gloss>–2, military intelligence, which he believes is the most detrimental influence of France in the country, because of its tie-up with the opium traffic. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> spoke at length on the nature and degree of the tie-up. He pointed out that the French air force and other forms of transport were involved. There was, he said, a considerable movement and re-deployment of French military forces which in his opinion had no visible military purpose. The implication he left was quite clear: that these movements were connected with the narcotics traffic. He mentioned in this connection the battle of Dienbienphu and the deployment of French troops in Laos which he said was concerned primarily with preventing the opium harvest from falling into communist hands. He said that his war against the sects was really a war against opium.</p>
<p>On the diplomatic side, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said that relations with France were shifting to a diplomatic basis. He pointed out that the Minister for the Associated States in the past will become a Minister of the Army in the French Ministry of Defense. He believed this was a face-saving device to bring about the closing up of the Ministry for the Associated States.</p>
<p>When <persName corresp="#p_HH1">Hoppenot</persName>, the new French Commissioner, was appointed, he raised with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> the question of whether he should take protocol precedence over the rest of the diplomatic corps in Saigon, pointing <pb xml:id="pg_521" n="521" facs="0551"/>out that he did not believe the other countries would object. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> felt, however, that he could not make this arrangement for fear of giving the Vietminh any excuse for claiming that the Saigon government was still under the domination of France.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> stressed that for the past year he has had to deal essentially in negatives. The problem was one of consolidating his authority in rooting out the dissidents and of making the government a going concern. Now he felt Viet Nam was entering a new and a constructive phase. He read from a piece of paper parts of their plans for economic development. He pointed out that in this phase it was necessary to deal with the serious social problems of the country and especially with the problem of the land. The program which he outlined in general followed that of most of the other countries of this area. He mentioned that he had some difficulty with the large French estates which had a considerable number of Vietnamese workers. He was trying to get the general principle accepted of 15% for rent, 85% for the worker of the land who would be settled on plots adequate to support himself and his family. One aspect of the plans involves securing control over the river barges which transport rice in Saigon. At the present time this trade is controlled by the Chinese, and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> apparently desires to have it in Vietnamese hands on the grounds that so long as the Chinese control it they also in effect control the price of rice.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> spoke of a financial problem which seems to be the key difficulty at the present time with the French. Many of the French here apparently are anxious to get their capital out of the country as rapidly as possible. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, on the other hand, does not want any such rapid flight for fear of its inflationary effects.</p>
<p>He pointed out that the French had also a Technical Assistance and Economic Aid Program which he was not adverse to accepting except on the specific terms which the French asked. They offered a certain amount of money for the program with the stipulation that it would be used immediately to permit other French here to remit their capital to France. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> felt that if this were done, his only alternative then would be to issue additional currency with consequent inflationary effects.<note n="3" xml:id="d246fn3"><persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> and Valeo also held conversations on August 18 with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Vu Van Mau</persName> and with both Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> and Counselor <persName corresp="#p_MFEJ1">Meloy</persName>.

<p>3. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have reviewed the comments and recommendations of <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> contained in the message referred to in subparagraph 1 b above concerning this matter. They consider that <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> has correctly assessed the situation in South Vietnam and has adequately answered the six points raised in your memorandum. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that the force bases proposed by the Country Team, Indochina, be supported through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956, with a review of the force bases for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957 to be made at a later date.</p>
<p>4. In view of the presently limited funds available for <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956, the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that approval of the foregoing recommended action should be contingent on obtaining the additional funds required for an increase to South Vietnamese forces from sources other than <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> end-item matériel and Direct Forces Support funds.</p>

<p>900. Reference: <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 411 sent Paris 474.<note n="2" xml:id="d248fn2">In this telegram, August 5, the Department of State noted that the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> in Vietnam was to be reduced to 30,000 by October 1955 and that this could provide justification for the United States reopening the question of the $100 million in U.S. aid for the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>. The Department also asked whether the <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> could maintain internal security in light of rapid French withdrawal, what the Embassy considered to be a desirable level for French forces in Vietnam, and what the status was of <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> equipment in Vietnam. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 851.10/7–3055)</note></p>
<p>1. Re questions raised in paragraph 2 reference telegram, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> believes that providing present plans for reorganization, regrouping and training (under 150,000 force concept) are approved and implemented, <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> has potential for increasing capabilities to extent necessary substantially to replace French ground forces even if latter withdrawn as quickly as is physically possible. By end 1955 <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> estimates <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> should have capability maintaining internal security and constituting mobile blocking force against external aggression, which supported by available French air and navy, would have certain delaying capabilities against Viet Minh aggression. <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>’s position has been and remains that, from military point of view, minimum French force of two combat divisions with balanced combat and service support should be retained in Vietnam at least until end 1955. In light of Vietnamese attitude toward continued presence <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>, however, and French reluctance to fight in Vietnam, we believe U.S. should accept whatever agreement is reached on <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> in Paris in current negotiations between French and Vietnamese. It will probably not be physically possible to withdraw French ground forces before the end of 1955 even if desired by both parties, and it is understood that Vietnamese recognize desirability retaining French air and navy until late 1956.</p>
<p>2. Re questions raised in paragraph 3, reference telegram, there exists adequate inventory <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> equipment showing items in hands French and Vietnamese. Return to U.S. control of <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> matériel no longer required for purposes for which it originally made available is governed by Minutes of Understanding signed December 1, 1954, by Generals <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>. Release of matériel proceeding in accordance capability local forces to take it over, and matériel not required by forces in Indochina, which is being released by French to U.S., is being redistributed outside Indochina. In accordance with above minutes removal <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> matériel from Indochina requires U.S. consent, <pb xml:id="pg_524" n="524" facs="0554"/>and departing <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> units have been taking only equipment belonging to France. In general there are adequate supplies of <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> equipment to equip recommended Vietnamese force of approximately 150,000 as well as forces of Cambodia and Laos as now contemplated.</p>

<list type="participants">
<head>PRESENT</head>
<item>Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> and Valeo</item>
</list>
<p>Tudor said that we were now backing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> solidly. Just prior to the Sect war, however, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> (advised by <persName corresp="#p_SPJ1">Paul Sturm</persName>) reposed complete confidence in <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">General Ely</persName> without giving sufficient regard to the fact that the French general was operating on instructions from Paris. Since French policy was to eliminate <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> tended to play along with that policy and we came close to undermining the Viet Namese premier.</p>
<p>When the Sect war broke out, <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> was in the United States and <persName corresp="#p_KRA1">Randolph Kidder</persName> was in charge. The State Department requested a report from Saigon and a country team meeting under <persName corresp="#p_KRA1">Kidder</persName> recommended support of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>
<p>Since that time support has been consistent for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and he is growing in strength and self-confidence. As for complaints that he cannot tolerate strong leaders in the Government, Tudor pointed out that “strong leaders” particularly military in the past have been unable to refrain from seeking political power. In that context, his position may be understandable.</p>
<p>Barring an invasion from the north, there is a good possibility that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> can consolidate in the south.</p>
<p>On <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s attitude, Tudor says that he is very suspicious but that once he develops confidence and faith in someone, it is very complete. He believes Rhinehart [<hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName></hi>] is cultivating a good relationship with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_525" n="525" facs="0555"/>
<p>As for Laos, Tudor believes it untenable militarily but that there is not likely to be a major Communist Viet Minh attack unless it is part of International Communist strategy. He does not think we should get too deeply committed there. Technical aid and some financial support to keep the present government operative should be the extent of our involvement.</p>
<p>In Cambodia, Tudor believes we may be pushing too hard, and there is a danger that it will produce an anti-American reaction and push the Cambodians into all-out neutralism. The approach there should be to let them take more of the initiative in coming to us. The elections, he says, are a factor in the present attitudes, but there may be something more in the developing of anti-Americanism—our own approach.</p>

<p>664. Joint State–<gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> message. For the Ambassador and Director, <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>.</p>
<p>1. We are concerned with lack of progress in agrarian reform in South Vietnam, as reported Embassy Despatch 453<note n="2" xml:id="d250fn2"><ref target="#d210">Document 210</ref>.</note> and other reports believing agrarian reform one means strengthening government and administration of South Vietnam. Conversely, lack of progress in agrarian reform hinders development sufficient strength by Government in rural areas to gain real control over South Vietnam.</p>
<p>2. Since current rent reduction and land utilization program appears inadequate, even if adequately implemented, what seems to be needed is full scale agrarian reform, involving broad scale improvement of all economic and social institutions connected with farm life. We note Government has announced 300,000 piasters will be spent in each village for community center, to house communal council, secondary school, clinic, and information center. Also that Government is sending medical and social assistance, and is organizing an education campaign to increase literacy and extend knowledge of modem sanitary and hygienic practices. Is this adequate and sufficiently <pb xml:id="pg_526" n="526" facs="0556"/>deep rooted or would further measures be necessary gain support countryside?</p>
<p>3. It is our impression that land ownership and land redistribution program is an essential part of needed agrarian reform program in South Vietnam recognizing that such a program would raise difficult administrative and legal problems and alienate some groups and individuals who at present are supporting Government. Would these disadvantages more than offset gains to be realized from “land for the landless” program sponsored by Government?</p>
<p>4. Admitting agrarian reform could not be carried out in certain insecure areas in South Vietnam could not start be made in areas under Government control? What progress if any has agrarian reform made in areas taken over from Viet Minh administrative control? What role in an agrarian reform program would newly organized General Commissariat for Planning and Reconstruction and Bao An Doan (Security Protection Group) be expected to play? How could an agrarian reform program most effectively assist in refugee resettlement and re-establishment on land of South Vietnamese driven off during long period hostilities?</p>
<p>5. A broad scale agrarian reform program has had some measure success in other Asian countries, e.g., Community Development Program in Philippines, Community Development Program in India, and Chinese-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction in Taiwan. Given current conditions in South Vietnam we would envisage that agrarian reform program in South Vietnam should be sole responsibility of Vietnamese Government, with advice and assistance from agencies of United States Government in Vietnam. Please comment.<note n="3" xml:id="d250fn3">In telegram 1332 from Saigon, September 20, the Embassy provided the following summary comments: (1) lack of enthusiasm for land reform by Vietnamese officialdom and lack of effective government administration were impeding agrarian reform program; (2) refugee resettlement added pressure for reform; (3) redistribution of ownership of land was not politically possible until after July 1956; and (4) security of tenure, rent reduction, and other assistance to tenant farmers could win rural support for the government, but to date such reforms were not being effectively instituted. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/9–2055)</note></p>
<p>6. If your answers to above inquiries indicate your agreement on need for broad scale agrarian reform in South Vietnam, Ambassador may at appropriate time inquire of President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> his present plans and intentions in this regard, and inform him of importance United States Government attaches this question. Ambassador may inform <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that we recall that several months ago in connection with reform program discussed with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> stated that land distribution scheme would be put into effect following rent reduction and land utilization program. If you consider appropriate, an <pb xml:id="pg_527" n="527" facs="0557"/>outline of desirable agrarian reform program could be prepared without indication of source which Ambassador could leave with President.</p>

<p>1. Continuing efforts have been made toward resolution problems of internal security discussed in ref desp. Although some progress achieved, much remains to be accomplished in this critical field. In collaboration with Vietnamese authorities and with assistance Michigan State University team, U.S. agencies Saigon have developed coordinated plan for organizing and training civilian security service. Part of program already underway, and remainder awaits Washington approval. In view of vital importance early establishment effective nationwide civilian security service as key to other civilian and military problems, country team strongly recommends approval of program and granting of funds and specific authorization requested in para 3 (a) and (d) below.</p>
<p>2. Atcs.—Vietnamese plan calls for:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) Establishment single security service under Ministry of Interior. Deputy Minister already designated Director Public Safety as over-all coordinator.</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_528" n="528" facs="0558"/>
<item>(b) National organization to be composed three major subdivisions each with own director: National Police (garde civile)—strength 25,000; semi-autonomous municipal police forces—strength 4,000–6,000; Vietnamese Bureau of Investigation (sûreté)—strength 4,000.</item>
<item>(c) Division of responsibilities as follows:
<list>
<item>National—Normal law enforcement all areas <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, excluding four major municipalities, to include counter-intelligence operation and counter subversive activities and nationwide police communications net.</item>
<item>Municipal—Same for four major cities <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</item>

</list></item></list>
<p>3. In conjunction with this plan, we believe following measures necessary:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) Transfer without charge to any appropriation considerable quantities surplus <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> equipment in Indochina and elsewhere to <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> for use Vietnamese national security services.

Breakdown <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 56 funds is: $545,465 to cover all costs additional U.S. personnel; $308,500 to cover specialized training Malaya, Philippines and employment 12–15 Philippine constabulary advisory group in Vietnam; $270,000 to cover purchase additional transportation not available through <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> surpluses; $704,000 to cover vehicle operation and maintenance costs; $606,500 to purchase riot guns, revolvers, tear gas, ammo, etc., not available through <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> surpluses; $100,000 to purchase criminal laboratory equipment.</item>
</list>
<p>4. To meet these additional expenses <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>/Saigon has reviewed the budget of <gloss target="#t_MSU1">MSU</gloss> project and of public administration program and has found the means of providing eight of the additional personnel and $500,000 toward the other additional expenses outlined above. The proposed necessary adjustments which, if approved by <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>/W, will permit these additions are as follows:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) Recruitment of two additional police specialists already provided for in the <gloss target="#t_MSU1">MSU</gloss> project.</item>
<item>(b) Substitution of police specialists for two public administration staff provided in <gloss target="#t_MSU1">MSU</gloss> project but not yet recruited.</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_529" n="529" facs="0559"/>
<item>(c) Use of savings on transportation and certain local expenses to employ three additional police specialists by increase in personnel ceiling of <gloss target="#t_MSU1">MSU</gloss> project without increase in total funds.</item>
<item>(d) Increase of one in personnel ceiling and increase of approximately $60,000 in budget of <gloss target="#t_MSU1">MSU</gloss> project to compensate for assignment of Lindholm to special tax advisory project proposed in <gloss target="#t_Toica1">Toica</gloss> 199<note n="4" xml:id="d251fn4">Not printed. (Washington National Records Center, <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> Files: Lot W–130, <gloss target="#t_FRC1">FRC</gloss> 57 A 248, Box 104)</note> and use of the additional position to employ a police specialist.</item>
<item>(e) Allotment of $250,000 already earmarked in public administration budget for equipment purchase plus addition of $250,000 from other funds programmed for public administration but not yet committed.</item>
</list>
<p>5. This leaves gap of approximately $1,700,000 between program recommended above and funds available from present allotments. Despite urgency of police problem, we believe that present commitments plus additions recommended above represent maximum charge which should be made against existing economic aid funds. Current military expenditures are less than programmed military aid, and increase in police project could be financed from savings in military budget. (It should be noted, however, that if not used for police program these surplus funds would serve to meet part of anticipated short-fall in 1956 military aid funds.) . . .</p>
<p>6. Pending approval of program and funds, we are proceeding along following lines using present available funds in <gloss target="#t_MSU1">MSU</gloss> contract plus presently available personnel from <gloss target="#t_MSU1">MSU</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and Embassy:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) Improvement effectiveness Saigon–Cholon municipal police;</item>

<item>(c) Maximum possible utilization of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>–sponsored <gloss target="#t_FAVN1">FAVN</gloss> schools for specialist training (use and maintenance of military type communications equipment, vehicles, and weapons) and basic military-refresher training for national police and, where appropriate, weapons instruction for other police elements;</item>

<p>1027. Reference: Department’s telegram 681.<note n="2" xml:id="d252fn2">In this telegram, August 26, the Department asked for information on Viet Minh capabilities in the South, including strength by region, description of political apparatus, and paramilitary organizations. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/8–2655)</note></p>
<p>1. Viet Minh circumspection in limiting post-Geneva activities in south to political action—leaving sabotage, terrorism, and [garble] opposition to disgruntled Nationalist elements—has permitted Viet Minh to operate so covertly and unobtrusively that probably only they themselves can accurately estimate their capabilities. French and non-Government Vietnamese observers usually ascribe omnipresence and great strength to Viet Minh political organization (cf Embassy despatch 55.<note n="3" xml:id="d252fn3">Dated August 24, not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/8–2455)</note>) Vietnamese Government spokesmen (even including <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>) frequently cite Viet Minh political strength as chief factor precluding National Assembly elections within free Vietnam. Government comments are confused, however, by tendency on one hand play down Viet Minh strength in order encourage Americans and themselves; and on other hand lump all anti-Government elements without distinction as “lackeys of Colonialists, Communists and Feudalists.”</p>
<p>2. Viet Minh paramilitary (and stay-behind regular military) organization impossible describe satisfactorily because careful concealment. Army Attaché has transmitted to <gloss target="#t_G1">G</gloss>–2 all reports received on this subject, including indications most provinces <gloss target="#t_CVN1">CVN</gloss>, south of 17th parallel have approximately equivalent one company each of armed personnel in small, dispersed groups, with framework for organizing ASH companies; Binh Dinh–Phu Yen region having equivalent one battalion. Similar armed groups indicated <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> provinces but organizational picture unclear. Attaché officers feel <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss>, despite best efforts, has not to date been able break up <gloss target="#t_VM1">VM</gloss> network of cadres left in place which designed to be filled out into units when and if needed; presumably projected strength is whatever <gloss target="#t_VM1">VM</gloss> feel <pb xml:id="pg_531" n="531" facs="0561"/>will be needed for job. Paucity of information concerning <gloss target="#t_VM1">VM</gloss> strength and activities according this view probably results largely from tightness of <gloss target="#t_VM1">VM</gloss> security and their political influence over population.</p>
<p>3. Political organization has emerged to surface in form “peace” and “mutual aid” front groups, most publicized in Saigon–Cholon but known to exist in other areas. Other reported front groups, particularly in rural areas, include religious-social groups centering around local Buddhist temples (utilized because of relative immunity from close Government supervision) and agricultural associations. Latter may have been used to promote suspicion of and opposition to such government measures as agrarian reform program and invalidation of torn currency; which is example of apparently minor item threatening become focus of anti-Government sentiment among farmers until Government backed down. All these groups are obviously appropriate channels for applying pressure along basic present line of Viet Minh “political struggle,” i.e., demand for consultative conference and 1956 elections.</p>
<p>4. Regions reported most subject to Viet Minh political influence are poor sections Saigon–Cholon, ex-<gloss target="#t_VM1">VM</gloss> regroupment zones particularly Ca Mau and Plaine Des Joncs, foothill region between Annam and Haut Plateau, P.M.S. (reported more important as communications route and possibly resistance base than political action area), Bentre, Mytho, and Tudaumot provinces. However, this may well show only greater frequency of reports rather than actually greater extent of influence. Typical degree of reported influence is that in certain areas Bentre and Mytho local inhabitants refuse participate in anti-<gloss target="#t_VM1">VM</gloss> local government for fear of reprisals.</p>
<p>5. Viet Minh political organization proper is described as clandestine small-cell unit size-up, apparently relatively immune to anti-subversion and penetration efforts of national government agencies. Viet Minh “Politbureau” controlling at least Saigon–Cholon operations is most commonly reported to be located in rural area with easy communications distance of Saigon near Thudaumot or Cailay (according prevailing versions). Location of over all regional control agency (if such exists separately from foregoing) is unknown. Couriers to and from North Vietnam are said to travel by variety of means, crossing 17th parallel in refugee guise, on foot or in small vessels between coastal points.</p>
<p>6. Viet Minh personnel traveling in French aircraft made available <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> in connection Geneva agreements business allegedly also act as couriers.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Events in Viet-Nam, August 15–September 2</item>
</list>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Political:</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> remains in control, with no powerful organized resistance. The Sects remain fairly quiescent. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is now making a tour of Central Viet-Nam where he is being enthusiastically received. The French informed Viet Minh on August 30th that the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> declaration of August 9th<note n="2" xml:id="d253fn2">See <ref target="#d240fn5">footnote 5, Document 240</ref>.</note> (which in effect rejected elections and consultations because of lack of freedom in Communist area) constituted Free Viet-Nam’s reply to the Viet Minh letter of July 19th,<note n="3" xml:id="d253fn3">See <ref target="#d233fn3">footnote 3, Document 233</ref>.</note> which had requested consultations. The initial Communist reaction to the French statement was that the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> declaration did not constitute a response to the Viet Minh letter. Eventual Communist reaction is hard to assess; the British predict vigorous, although undefined, Viet Minh retaliation.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Military:</p>
<p>The Government’s campaign against the Sect forces was successful in destroying them as organized forces. They still have the capability to operate as guerrillas, but have been relatively quiet. A series of anti-American incidents in Saigon, of undetermined origin included: The throwing of a grenade at the Ambassador’s residence (no damage); the wrecking of several American cars by small bombs; the destruction of six American cars on the docks while being unloaded; the distribution of anti-American pamphlets. The United Front Organization composed mainly of the Binh Xuyen, with a Communist tie suspected, has taken credit over its radio for this campaign. Two junior French army officers were caught by the Vietnamese police while unsuccessfully attempting to plant charges to blow up a small sidewalk cafe in Saigon patronized by Europeans and Americans. The two French officers are being held in Vietnamese custody pending the investigation. The French have protested strongly, allegedly threatening to cut off gasoline supplies to the Vietnamese army <pb xml:id="pg_533" n="533" facs="0563"/>unless the officers are released to French control. Recent reports indicate the French actually did cut off gasoline supplies on August 25th but restored service on August 30th. We are investigating this act, as it may involve United States-supplied gasoline.</p>
<p>The Vietnamese have a delegation in Paris prepared to negotiate an agreement on the French Expeditionary Corps force levels. Viet-Nam has consulted <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName> on this and will propose to the French that the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> be pared down to 30,000 by October of 1955 (presently about 45,000) and then withdrawn completely by April 1956, except for small security guards on remaining French naval and air bases. Some four hundred French would be assigned to the Vietnamese army training mission, which will remain under United States command. French Navy and Air would phase out completely by the end of 1956, but certain unspecified ground, naval, and air bases might remain as mutually agreed upon. This proposal seems reasonable to us and we think the French will agree to it, particularly in view of their current need for troops in Africa. Major <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName>, whom you met, is scheduled to take over from <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName> in October or November as <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Chief.</p>
<p>The Secretary has approved the <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> memorandum<note n="4" xml:id="d253fn4"><ref target="#d245">Document 245</ref>.</note> which recommends a force level of 150,000 for Viet-Nam instead of the 100,000 originally scheduled. We understand, informally, that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> has approved such a level and that <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> is working on the details of financial support.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Economic:</p>
<p><gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> is proposing that our grant aid programs to Viet-Nam, Laos, and Cambodia be altered so that $25 million of the Vietnamese program be in the form of a loan instead of a grant. Similarly, they are proposing $10 million of the Cambodian program and $5 million of the Lao program be loans. We are opposing these moves on the grounds that it is not practicable to impose such loans on their shaky economy.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary:</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s continued success is due in large part to the lack of organized opposition to him. He has not, for one reason or another, proceeded to pacify the outlying regions where Viet Minh sympathy, and possibly forces, still remain. He is adamant that he will not deal with the Communists regarding elections and is reinforced in this by the Secretary’s statement of August thirtieth (attached).<note n="5" xml:id="d253fn5"><p>The reference is to an answer which <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> gave at his press conference, August 30, in response to a question as to whether the United States would support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s view that there was no possibility of free elections in the North as long as the Viet Minh were in control there. The statement is not attached to the source text. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> answered as follows:</p>
<p>“We certainly agree that conditions are not ripe for free elections. I have always taken the position, and I think I have taken it publicly, that we see no reason to oppose having elections if there can be produced conditions of genuine freedom. In other words, if you could have conditions in the North so that there would not only be a free choice in the sense of being able to put a ballot of your own selection in the ballot box; but also, conditions where there would not be threats in advance or retaliation afterwards—if you could produce those conditions, then I would feel confident that the non-Communists would win the elections, and it would be very desirable to have elections. Whether or not those conditions can be created, I do not know. They have never yet been created in a Communist-controlled area, and in general the Communists have, as we know, always rejected the establishment of conditions which would enable free elections to be held.” (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/ 8–3055)</p></note> The French <pb xml:id="pg_534" n="534" facs="0564"/>and British are expected to continue their efforts to influence <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to adhere to the Geneva agreement. Communist tactics are still unclear, but there is no evidence of their preparation for aggression. No real progress has been made toward the establishment of an assembly.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> remains the leading anti-Communist nationalist and is gaining in stature. The greatest danger to Free Viet-Nam lies in the lack of constructive programs for pacification and internal consolidation. Our influence on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is probably lessening as he grows in popularity. He remains friendly to the United States but is determined, at the same time, to go his own way.</p>
<p>There are signs of a growing Asian understanding of the problem of Communist aggression in Indochina and the recent establishment of diplomatic relations with the Philippines, and the imminence of such with Korea are noteworthy. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is anxious to conclude a bilateral defense treaty with Viet-Nam, but details are still unknown.</p>
<p>During the reconvening of the United Nations in New York on September 27–28, the three Foreign Ministers agreed to hold talks in preparation for the October Geneva meeting. We are preparing position papers for these talks and will have a list of topics for your approval this week.<note n="6" xml:id="d253fn6">The list is contained in a memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> to Waddell, September 8.

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>U.S. Policy in the Event of a Renewal of Aggression in Vietnam.</item>
</list>
<p>1. This memorandum is in response to a memorandum by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (<gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss>), dated 19 August 1955, subject as above,<note n="9" xml:id="d254fn9">Not printed; filed as enclosure A to a note by the Secretaries to the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> (<gloss target="#t_JCS1">J.C.S.</gloss> 1992/474), August 22. (<gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> Records, CCS 092 Asia (6–25–48))</note> in which he requested the Joint Chiefs of Staff to determine the implications and requirements of U.S. military operations, with and without atomic weapons, (1) to repulse and punish overt <pb xml:id="pg_537" n="537" facs="0567"/>Vietminh aggression, or (2) to destroy Vietminh forces and take control of North Vietnam.</p>
<p>2. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that for the near future, unassisted South Vietnamese forces will be capable of only limited resistance against determined overt aggression by Vietminh forces. Without a warning period in which U.S. preparatory actions were taken, a portion of South Vietnam would probably be overrun, and the integrity of elements of the defending forces would be impaired or lost.</p>
<p>3. Under the foregoing probable conditions, the first task operations to repulse and punish overt Vietminh aggression would include:</p>
<list>
<item>a. Immediate U.S. naval and air attack against Vietminh forces.</item>
<item>b. Initial reliance upon Vietnamese ground forces supported by U.S. naval and air operations to oppose the aggression.</item>
<item>c. Early movement forward of mobile U.S. forces, for the purpose of conducting joint operations for tasks beyond the capabilities of South Vietnamese forces.</item>
<item>d. The provision of direct and increased logistical support to Vietnamese forces.</item>
</list>
<p>4. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that the second task, to destroy Vietminh forces and take control of North Vietnam would require an extension of the operations listed in paragraph 3 above, with the ultimate objective of creating conditions under which the forces of South Vietnam, the Associated States or <gloss target="#t_SEACDT1">SEACDT</gloss> could assume responsibility for accomplishment of the second task. This would require a major campaign of pacification, accompanied by the development of additional indigenous forces for an enlarged mission. Such a campaign would be initiated by joint and combined operations in the Tonkin Delta area to seize bases and other important objectives and to cut supply lines from Communist China.</p>
<p>5. The success of intervention by U.S. forces in a swift and decisive action is believed dependent on the military energy and solidarity of the Vietnamese, the extent of warning and preparations made before an attack, the restriction imposed on U.S. military operations, and the season of the year. It is estimated that operations to carry out the first task could be terminated in a few months to one year to check aggression, but a longer time might be required to clear out all the Vietminh back to the 17th parallel. The time needed for carrying out the second task cannot be accurately estimated. Should employment of atomic weapons not be authorized a longer time would be required. Additionally, although the concepts would not require change, this restriction on the use of atomic weapons would not permit the most effective employment of U.S. armed forces and consequently <pb xml:id="pg_538" n="538" facs="0568"/>might require greater forces than the U.S. would be justified in providing from the over-all point of view.</p>
<p>6. With reference to U.S. force requirements:</p>
<list>
<item>a. Naval forces currently assigned to the Pacific Fleet are ready to accomplish initial naval missions. For the first task one carrier task force, a bombardment force, an appropriate amphibious force, Marine detachments, and logistical resupply forces would be required. For the second task some augmentation in U.S. naval forces would be required.</item>
<item>b. Assuming the use of atomic weapons, Air Force requirements for either task would be two to three tactical Air Force wings and <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> forces as necessary. Assuming no use of atomic weapons, there would be an increase of tactical air requirements, particularly for the second task; however, sufficient air bases are not available to position these larger forces. For both tasks, in addition to the forces above, tactical airlift for one airborne <gloss target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss> and strategic airlift for one division would be required.</item>
<item>c. For the first task, ground forces in the magnitude of two to four U.S. divisions should be available for operations listed in paragraph 3 above. For the second listed task, it is estimated that a total strength of up to eight U.S. divisions would be required. Requirements for U.S. ground forces would be subject to reduction to the extent that effective forces were provided by other Manila Pact countries or by other Allies.</item>
<item>d. Forces available are as shown in Appendix “A”.<note n="10" xml:id="d254fn10">Appendix A, “Availability of U.S. Armed Forces,” is not printed. For text, see <hi rend="italic">United States–Vietnam Relations, 1945–1967</hi>, Book 10, pp. 1007–1011.</note></item>

</list>
<p>7. The effects upon other U.S. military commitments as a result of these operations by U.S. armed forces in Southeast Asia would be significant and in proportion to the amount of diversion of forces to this area and the speed with which these diverted forces are returned or replaced. However, the Fleet Marine Forces and certain Army forces in the Pacific could be deployed to the area temporarily without serious effects on other military commitments and without necessitating partial mobilization or substantial increases in force levels and budgetary support.</p>
<p>8. The strongest deterrent to Vietminh aggression, and, at the same time, the most effective preparatory military step would be the stationing of U.S. forces in South Vietnam. However, this course of action is prohibited, prior to an act of aggression, by the terms of the Geneva agreements. The next most effective deterrent would be to add to the deterrent effect of the forces presently deployed in the Far East by deploying mobile ground forces of approximately corps <pb xml:id="pg_539" n="539" facs="0569"/>strength together with naval and air forces into the Southeast Asia area prepared for rapid commitment to South Vietnam. Nevertheless, the Joint Chiefs of Staff are of the opinion that at this time the major threat to South Vietnam continues to be that of subversion, and until there are more conclusive indications of overt aggression, it is not considered that additional forces should be deployed to the Southeast Asia area.</p>
<p>9. Preparatory military steps which might be taken are:</p>
<list>
<item>a. Continued efforts to increase the effectiveness of the South Vietnamese armed forces for countering external aggression as well as maintaining internal security. In this connection, reference is made to memorandum for the Secretary of Defense, dated 19 August 1955, subject: “Revised Force Bases for Vietnam”.</item>
<item>b. Continued improvement of bases in Thailand and Cambodia for use in support of Vietnamese forces.</item>
<item>c. Special training for selected Vietnamese personnel, outside of Vietnam if necessary, in U.S. methods of exploiting air and naval support in ground operations. Instruction might also be provided in the special tactics and techniques of employing atomic weapons support.</item>
<item>d. Accelerated progress in the military aspects of the Manila Pact including combined training. Exercises could be timed to attain optimum psychological and political impact; for example, joint and combined maneuver type exercises in the Philippines or Thailand could be scheduled immediately prior to the Vietnam elections to indicate progress made by non-Communist nations toward collective security, and readiness on the part of Manila Pact nations to carry out their commitments.</item>
<item>e. Aside from the foregoing, preparations can be made for the rapid movement of tactical air control parties and some ground liaison, logistic and communications personnel to Vietnam, in advance of major U.S. formations, to insure an early capability for U.S. supporting operations. Similarly, preparations can be made for early deployment of special U.S. forces to provide a capability for ground delivery of atomic weapons.</item>
</list>
<p>10. In the early stages, Vietminh aggression would probably be characterized by a fluid situation with dispersed clashes between opposing forces. In such operations, the opportunities for employing atomic weapons would not justify significant reductions in early force requirements. During later stages, however, suitable targets could be expected to develop as a result of friendly efforts to force concentrations or particularly if the Chinese Communists should intervene overtly. Use of atomic weapons should result in a considerable reduction in friendly casualties and in more rapid cessation of hostilities. In any event, no prohibitions should be imposed on the use of atomic weapons, or on other military operations, to the extent of precluding effective military reaction as the situation develops. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that if atomic weapons were not <pb xml:id="pg_540" n="540" facs="0570"/>used, greater forces than the U.S. would be justified in providing would probably be needed.</p>
<p>11. The Joint Chiefs of Staff reiterate the view expressed in their memorandum, dated 11 February 1955, subject: “Concept and Plans for the Implementation, if Necessary, of Article IV, 1, of the Manila Pact,”<note n="12" xml:id="d254fn12">See <ref target="#d38">Document 38</ref>.</note> that the United States cannot guarantee the territorial integrity of any member nation (of the Manila Pact), but at most can help secure the independence of those countries whose peoples desire it and who are willing to undertake the responsibilities of self government. This appears to be particularly applicable to protected, non-member countries.</p>
<p>12. The foregoing is a rough estimate of the requirements. A more definitive answer cannot be made until the Commander in Chief, Pacific, provides a plan which he is presently developing.</p>
<p>13. The Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, did not participate in the action of the Joint Chiefs of Staff outlined in this memorandum.</p>

<p>1350. Reference: <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 937 sent London unnumbered, New Delhi 629, pouched London.<note n="2" xml:id="d255fn2">In this telegram, September 17, the Department of State asked for the Embassy’s estimate of how far the United States could go in pressing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to enter into indirect consultation with the Viet Minh which would not give any commitments regarding elections, but might constitute a minimum response to the Viet Minh. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/9–1655)</note></p>
<p>1. Embassy fully recognizes difficulty of finding effective new approach to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to influence him enter into indirect consultations with Viet Minh which would not be commitment regarding elections, yet would provide minimum satisfaction to <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, Geneva co-chairmen, <pb xml:id="pg_541" n="541" facs="0571"/>French, Viet Minh and meet with approval of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s supporters.</p>
<p>2. Best solution we can propose how is to give convincing impression Vietnamese Government has not rejected possibility of consultations in near future. This might be done by using need for prior creation of National Assembly as a peg for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s reply to <persName corresp="#p_PVD1">Dong</persName>’s message to co-chairman.<note n="3" xml:id="d255fn3">The reference is to a note by <persName corresp="#p_PVD1">Pham Van Dong</persName> of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, September 20, to the cochairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina complaining of delay in implementing reunification of Vietnam through free elections as provided for in the Geneva Accords. Text of the note is in despatch 668 from London, September 22. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/9–2255)</note> <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could announce date for National Assembly elections and State Assembly would speak for people on question of election consultations. Idea is not new as <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> used it at time of Bandung Conference as reason for delaying consultations. We also suggested (without success) he use it more explicitly at time he was preparing his August 9 reply to <persName corresp="#p_PVD1">Dong</persName>’s July 19 message. However, it is a tactic we might now concentrate on for following reasons:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) In our opinion it is device which appears have good chance of satisfying all elements referred to in (1) above, which [<hi rend="italic">with?</hi>] possible exception of Viet Minh. Latter, however, would find it difficult take strong public exception to what <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could easily present as democratic procedure to permit free expression of national will on issue of primary concern to the people.</item>
<item>(b) If <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> agrees use Assembly device to meet requirements on international scene, he would be further committed to fulfill government’s long-standing promise on national scene.</item>
<item>(c) <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s reply to Viet Minh could use to good propaganda advantage fact that <persName corresp="#p_PVD1">Dong</persName>, quoting article seven of final declarationin message to co-chairmen, conspicuously omitted very pertinent passage: “In order to ensure that sufficient progress in restoration of peace has been made, and that all necessary conditions obtain for free expression of the national will . . . .”<note n="4" xml:id="d255fn4">Ellipsis in the source text.</note></item>
</list>
<p>3. Using Assembly as peg for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s reply will, of course, succeed only if reasonably early, yet realistic, date is set for Assembly and if that date is subsequently adhered to by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>.</p>
<p>4. Concerning suitable channel for reply to <persName corresp="#p_PVD1">Dong</persName>’s message, it is possible <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will be willing answer in form of reply to <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> after latter has officially transmitted <persName corresp="#p_PVD1">Dong</persName>’s message to Vietnamese Government. In response our inquiry, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Counselor Etherington-<persName corresp="#p_SWB1">Smith</persName> told us his government has in the past exchanged correspondence with Vietnamese Government on matters for which <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> responsible as co-chairman of Geneva conference (e.g., sharing costs of <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>, reports of <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> to co-chairman), and Vietnamese Government has never <pb xml:id="pg_542" n="542" facs="0572"/>shown reluctance reply to <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> despite fact matters dealt with Geneva agreement. Counselor emphasized, however, that while his government might be willing facilitate initial steps in consultations, he believes it would not wish become continuing channel of communication between Viet Minh and Vietnamese.</p>
<p>5. If Department agrees we should urge <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> answer Viet Minh via letter to <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, question then remains what, if any, pressure we can or should use on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to obtain result desired. Although our ability exert pressure is apparently great because of govemment’s dependence on US support, in actual fact, if we wish our efforts to be effective we can do little more than use ardent persuasion, basing our arguments exclusively on Vietnam’s self-interest.</p>
<p>6. We have reason to believe that possibility Russia may raise election issue at Geneva in October raises hope rather than fear among many Vietnamese Government officials because they anticipate Russia may also insist on subsequent 9-power conference. We suspect Vietnamese Government would like nothing better than to appear as sovereign nation in such a forum to present its own case in hope of getting sympathetic world audience and possible backing for postponement of general elections under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> supervision. They also count on US protection to shield them from possible Viet Minh military reaction to their intransigence.</p>
<p>7. Informal comments from British and French colleagues during past week indicate they consider use of need for National Assembly as possible peg for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s reply.</p>
<p>8. French Counselor <persName corresp="#p_HSF1">Hessel</persName> seems to be thinking along more rigid lines. He suggests <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> might announce a time-table which would specify dates for creation National Assembly, for Assembly discussion of general election issue, and possibly for holding general elections. (We feel it would be inadvisable even to suggest to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> he mention a date for general elections because he would immediately suspect Western powers of attempting gradually push him into actual elections.)</p>
<p>9. <persName corresp="#p_HSF1">Hessel</persName> also seems to be considering possibility of gaining time for Vietnam by having <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> propose <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> commission conduct pre-electoral investigation to determine whether conditions exist for free elections. We see dangers in this approach.</p>

During call on Secretary last night (September 26) <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> raised question of Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said he concerned about attitude of Vietnam Government and feared that if it continued to oppose discussion with Vietminh re elections <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> would throw in the sponge. He was particularly concerned that India would either suggest withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> or request formal meeting of co-chairmen of 1954 Geneva Conference. He said that if <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> withdrew Vietminh might engage in overt military action. He asked the Secretary’s views.</p>
<p>The Secretary said he understood US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and French representatives in Vietnam agreed that best course of action was to urge <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to hold elections in Free Vietnam. If <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> agreed to elections he could then take position he understandably unwilling to enter consultations with Vietminh until he had mandate from Vietnamese people. US was urging <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to follow this course of action. Secretary suggested that if Indians press <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> he should point out that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> does not have authority to speak for Vietnamese people until elections in South Vietnam are held and that <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, US and France all urging <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to hold such elections as soon as practicable.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> agreed and said that he was engaged in a stalling operation with Indians to prevent them from either bringing matters to a crisis re withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> or insisting on a formal meeting of the Geneva co-chairmen which he strongly opposed, particularly since he had “inherited <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> co-chairmanship from <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>.”</p>

A draft preamble to the proposed constitution provided that individual rights would be exercised “to the extent compatible with requirements of independence, public security and general interest.” The two referenda were to be followed by direct elections for a National Assembly. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/9–2855)</note></p>
<p>1. In private conversation Sept 26, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> indicated to me govt planning to proceed along lines described in para 2 <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>.<note n="3" xml:id="d259fn3">This paragraph contained the schedule for the successive elections.</note> No official announcement has yet been made.</p>
<p>2. I took occasion to remind <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> of numerous conversations with him and other <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> officials in which I and members of Embassy had endeavored to explain disadvantages in use of referendum to resolve imperial question. He countered with usual arguments. I said that submission of constitution for adoption by referendum was equally undesirable procedure and asked why he could not simplify process by having constitution dealt with by elected constituent assembly. Essence of his reply was that he feared an assembly would take too long and in the end produce an unacceptable document providing for too much parliamentary authority over the govt. Vietnam could not afford at this step to risk in the instability of parliamentary govt on the French model.</p>
<p>3. The only point he seemed to accept during course of lengthy discussion was my suggestion that if he felt compelled to hand down a constitution ex cathedra he might at least label it “provisional” and permit the assembly to work on the drafting of a definitive organic constitution to be adopted at some later date. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> did not speak to me of substance his proposed constitution. Accordingly, our knowledge of draft reported in <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> remains unofficial.</p>
<p>4. Following is our thinking re above plan:</p>
<list>
<item>a. Program is somewhat cumbersome, involving as it does two referenda and two elections<note n="4" xml:id="d259fn4">Communal and municipal elections were scheduled to be held simultaneously with the second referendum.</note> within three months. Mechanics may prove more difficult than Vietnamese anticipate in view lack experience such matters.</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_548" n="548" facs="0578"/>
<item>b. Undemocratic aspects of program will be apparent both internally and abroad. Referendum procedure clearly less democratic than having elected assembly decide on questions of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and new constitution. Constitution concentrates power heavily in hands of President, who can dissolve house as well as govern through issuance ordinances in emergency. On other hand no presidential veto of legislation passed by house is provided for (although this may be added in later draft).</item>
<item>c. In spite of above shortcomings, implementation of program would result healthier situation than present, and program may very possibly represent greatest measure of democracy possible in Free Vietnam today constituent [<hi rend="italic">consistent?</hi>] with maintenance of strong, stable govt.</item>
<item>d. Govt appears determined to proceed with program, and it is unlikely U.S. could bring about significant modification without exertion of greatest pressure.</item>
<item>e. Believe it essential some action be taken soon, and would therefore consider implementation above program preferable to further procrastination and haggling.</item>
<item>f. Most important that elections for assembly be held. Possibility exists that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> may proceed with referenda and then postpone assembly elections. (It is clear that direct elections will pose many problems and he had, therefore, felt indirect elections safer and probably adequate.)</item>
<item>g. Believe our best plan of ensuring that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> proceed with assembly elections is to make unequivocally clear to him importance we attach to assembly and fact our ability to continue supporting him effectively in such matters as Geneva consultations predicated in large part on his making progress on government programs such as election of National Assembly.</item>

<p>At the request of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board, the intelligence agencies have examined the consequences of certain specified US courses of action with respect to Vietnam and have arrived at the following principal conclusions which were approved by the Intelligence Advisory Committee on September 13, 1955:</p>
<p>1. If the US were to undertake sufficient military, political, and economic steps to clearly convince the Communists that overt aggression by the Viet Minh against South Vietnam will be met by swift and determined US armed intervention, such aggression would be most unlikely.</p>
<p>2. If, after taking the preparatory steps assumed in point 1 above, the US failed to intervene against an open Viet Minh attack, US prestige and influence in Asia would be drastically lowered and the Manila Pact as an effective instrument against Communist aggression would almost certainly be destroyed. The Chinese Communists would probably apply strong pressure against those countries whose determination to resist Communist inroads had been most weakened. As a result, the free nations of mainland Southeast Asia would become increasingly inclined to attempt to maintain their independence through negotiated understandings with Peiping.</p>
<p>3. If the US failed to intervene against an open Viet Minh attack without previously having made its intentions clearer than they are at present, the local reactions in Southeast Asia would be virtually the same as those noted in point 2 above. The Communists, however, would be less inclined to believe that the failure to intervene indicated that the US would not resist Communist aggression elsewhere. They might therefore proceed more cautiously in their efforts to exploit the situation created by the fall of Vietnam.</p>
<p>4. If the US intervened against an open Viet Minh attack, Asian and European approval for such action would be tempered by fear that the fighting could not be limited to Vietnam. Our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies and Japan would exert pressure on the US to limit its objective to restoring the status quo. Only Nationalist China, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, and possibly Thailand and the Philippines, would give unqualified support to a US declaration that its objective was to destroy the Viet Minh regime and extend non-Communist control to all Vietnam.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Vietnamese National Assembly and other Political Reforms</item>
</list>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> has sent in the Vietnamese plans for two referenda and an election for a national assembly. These plans are contained in his 1468<note n="2" xml:id="d261fn2">See <ref target="#d259fn2">footnote 2, Document 259</ref>.</note> and 1483<note n="3" xml:id="d261fn3"><ref target="#d259">Document 259</ref>.</note> attached. U.S. officials have been emphasizing to French, British and others the importance of being able to tell the Communists that a national assembly in Free Viet-Nam is a prerequisite to any Vietnamese consideration of consultations and all-Vietnamese elections. I think that line is a sound one in terms of dealing with the Geneva elections problem.</p>
<p>However, I would like to enter a reservation and possibly a minority dissent regarding elections in South Viet-Nam for a national assembly. I have put a mild reservation in the attached outgoing telegram<note n="4" xml:id="d261fn4">See <ref target="#d264">Document 264</ref>.</note> for your signature commenting on <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName>’s 1483. In that telegram he indicates that “it is most important” that elections be held and that we make “unequivocally clear” to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> the importance we attach to an assembly. I agree with this in theory but I am very worried over how such elections might work out in practice. Democracies in newly independent Asian countries are unpredictable things and first elections like first experiences in anything are utterly unpredictable. I hardly need cite Indonesia as a case in point. As for Viet-Nam, I cannot give you or the Secretary the slightest indication as to what might happen if there were free, secret general elections in South Viet-Nam on December 22 as <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has now scheduled them. Pro-government forces might win a majority or a jumble of complicated parties might so split representation that there would be no single responsible support for the government, or the Viet Minh and their sympathizers might cleverly get a lot of seats. Unless there is pretty good prior political preparation through vigorous political leadership and a political country-wide party, the national assembly and elections in South Viet-Nam might turn out to be a sour experience. I just don’t know and therefore I am reluctant for the United States and its friends to start pressing the Vietnamese down this path <pb xml:id="pg_551" n="551" facs="0581"/>from which there is no return. From all the information I can get from despatches as well as from Americans who have talked with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and his advisers, I am satisfied that they are fully aware of the delicate task of finding adequate balance between the establishment of strong, stable, executive leadership and the widest possible extent of representative institutions. A more constitutional process is needed in Viet-Nam to take care of the <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> problem, and increase <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s authority. On the other hand, premature or excessive popular representation might submerge the still very frail structure we have been able to help <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> put together despite the almost unsurmountable obstacles during the past twelve months. I naturally hesitate to endanger what has been won so hard.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendations:<note n="5" xml:id="d261fn5">This heading and recommendation no. 2 are written in the source text in an unidentified hand, presumably done in the office of the Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs.</note></p>
<p>1. Therefore, I would recommend that the United States Government not press <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to hold elections and form an assembly at any particular time during the next three to six months. I think we should let him be the judge of the adequacy and timeliness of his own preparations.</p>

<dateline><hi rend="italic">[<placeName>Washington</placeName>,] <date when="1955-10-05">October 5, 1955</date></hi>.</dateline>
<p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Fred</persName>: One more matter while it is on my mind. It seems to me that developments have reached the stage in Viet-Nam where we should start to plan and operate on a longer-term basis than we have during the past twelve months. We have jerked from crisis to crisis and there will be more. Yet, it seems to me that despite many weaknesses in Viet-Nam, there are some positive trends in the international, political, economic and military fields that for the first time may allow us to take a longer view.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_552" n="552" facs="0582"/>
<p>On the international plane, it seems to me we can now proceed with the assumption that there will be no all-Vietnamese elections in 1956. Barring major hostilities, the South will remain under a non-Communist regime for some time, despite great difficulties in the South owing largely to the administrative weaknesses of the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government, the unknown capabilities of the Viet Minh and mounting economic deficiencies. A free and united Viet-Nam should be our ultimate objective but, unless force is used which we forswear and which the Communists may forgo, I do not see any immediate prospects for an acceptable political unification. Judging only by such indications as the passing of July 20 without major incident, the rather leisurely pace which all the Communist leaders have so far followed regarding the consultation issue, and the hints from the Viet Minh on zonal “autonomy”, one can now speculate that Communist diplomacy will not put on unbearable pressure regarding this issue of unification by Geneva, although it may be heavy. Moreover, the British and the French have come a long way since last May–July when they were horrified and terrified over our approach. We got over the July 20 hurdle surprisingly well, which may be significant. Perhaps the Vietnamese can persuade the French to see that French interests in Viet-Nam will be better served by falling away from a strict implementation of the Final Declaration at Geneva. All these strains do not add up to international harmony on Viet-Nam, but the high pitch seems to be dropping, for the moment at least.</p>
<p>On the political side, Free Viet-Nam is now undertaking the intricate process of establishing some form of constitutional government. This is going to take months and years to work out successfully. I have just been reading “Representative Government in Southeast Asia” by Prof. Emerson of Harvard and published early this year. A few quotations are particularly pertinent now that we have the Vietnamese proposals to look at:</p>
<list>
<item>“The question may indeed be asked as to the propriety of establishing the ability effectively to manage representative institutions as one of the major criteria in judging the political record and prospects of Southeast Asian countries. . . . No one should come to the study of Southeast Asian political institutions with the fixed preconception that they should conform to established Western models.”<note n="2" xml:id="d262fn2">Ellipsis in the source text. The quotation is from Rupert Emerson, <hi rend="italic">Representative Government in Southeast Asia</hi> (Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 1955), pp. 16, 192.</note></item>
</list>
<p>These Asian countries will have to find their own balance between the values of sufficient authority and effectiveness of executive leadership on the one hand and adequate, responsible expression of the popular will on the other. It will be a delicate and unstable relationship at best. It seems to me the benefit of the doubt at this stage of <pb xml:id="pg_553" n="553" facs="0583"/>the game should be given the need for strong leadership. Our Asian friends should not have too much compunction about copying Western forms intact. Thus Vietnamese proposals sent in your 1468<note n="3" xml:id="d262fn3">Not printed, but see <ref target="#d259fn2">footnote 2, Document 259</ref>.</note> look suitable at first glance and probably as good as can be expected. I should think the Vietnamese would need a strong, centralized form of government with suitable outlets for voicing local and public opinion, including a “responsible” opposition. It is not surprising that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> closely followed the Cambodian elections and political developments.<note n="4" xml:id="d262fn4">In elections held on September 11 for the Cambodian National Assembly, the Sangkum Reastr Niyum (Socialist People’s Community) led by Prince <persName corresp="#p_SN1">Norodom Sihanouk</persName> swept all seats, overwhelming the opposition Democratic Party. The SRN platform called for the abolition of all political parties and the direct election of village representatives. The cabinet was to be responsible to the Crown, which would have veto power over all legislation.</note> Apparently, he is concerned about parliamentary forms that weaken the executive and overcentralization of authority that discourages opposition. The “institutionalizing” of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s regime adds new and long overdue political elements that have been so sorely needed for well founded diplomatic policies which have been necessarily so personalized by the pro- or anti-<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> problem.</p>
<p>There is even more need for long-range economic planning. I touched on this in my other letter but I just want to mention it again since it seems to me and Len Tyson, who handles economic affairs for Southeast Asia, that this is particularly important. The issues were raised in the points made to Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> and in <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s speech of September 17, both reported in your 1113 of September 6,<note n="5" xml:id="d262fn5">Not printed. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.5–MSP/9–655) The most comprehensive account of the economic proposals handed to Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> on August 20 at a meeting with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and his Ministers is in despatch 84 from Saigon, September 19, and its enclosures. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 851G.00/9–1955)</note> and 1361 of September 21.<note n="6" xml:id="d262fn6">In this telegram the Embassy summarized <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s speech. The President had called for enlarging Vietnam’s economic independence through the pursuit of a liberal credit policy which would stimulate domestic investment and through discouragement of additional foreign investment in those sectors essential to national security, such as basic transportation, the marketing of food, and the supply of the army. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> also stressed industrialization, to be confined at first to products presently imported but for which Vietnam had natural resources, such as rice milling and simple textiles. Lastly, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> called for the mechanization of agriculture, to be accomplished by the creation of large tillable units in the form of producer cooperatives. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 851G.00/9–2155)</note> We ought to shift the basis of our planning and programming in Viet-Nam to a longer range basis. We have had to meet emergencies and I think on the whole our agencies have done a good job. But should not we now address ourselves to the basic structure and nature of the economy of Viet-Nam? What about the whole land reform question that has been so disappointing so far. This is all a pretty complicated subject. I do not yet visualize how we can get a grasp of it. That is why I have been thinking of some kind <pb xml:id="pg_554" n="554" facs="0584"/>of a special mission which could take the time to work with <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Leland Barrows</persName> who is doing a splendid job and with the operational people in <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> in order to come up with some well thought out recommendations. The problem is that many of us are so tied down in Saigon and in Washington that we cannot do this kind of job. But I do feel we should change our approach.</p>
<p>On the military side, I merely mention the new Washington agreement to support your recommendation on the 150,000 force level. We never should have gone down to 90,000 or then 100,000 in such a short time. But we all learned—even generals—and I think corrected our error before completely off course. The growing capabilities and the loyalty of the <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> have been the decisive factor, perhaps this year. <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName> and <gloss target="#t_TRIM1">TRIM</gloss> have done a wonderful job. At last we may think there is an anchor in Viet-Nam that gives some promise of holding in some winds at least.</p>
<p>To sum up, I would like now to try to gear United States agencies to using more long-range factors in their planning and operations in Viet-Nam. This means the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> here and the <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> there. I would much appreciate your judgment. Perhaps you could talk to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Howard Jones</persName>, and Ray Moyer about this.<note n="7" xml:id="d262fn7">The reference is to a trip by <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> in October to Tokyo, Seoul, Taipei, Manila, Saigon (October 25–27), Bangkok, Vientiane, Phnom Penh, Rangoon, Jakarta, Singapore, and Hong Kong. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> began the trip with <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> but was forced to leave the tour at Manila to return to Washington because of <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ earlier-than-anticipated departure for the Geneva Conference.

<p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Long-range Planning for the Associated States</p>
<p>The Chairman opened the discussion with a proposal for shifting our approach from a short-term crash basis to more long-range planning and development where feasible. In his opinion it is possible to assume that internal developments in each of the Associated States have reached the point where some long-term planning may be conceivable. On the political side there have been some positive developments in each of these countries which would permit us for the first time to take a longer view. We had begun our aid programs during a period of war and rapid transition circumstances which allowed us to do no more than quickly fill urgent or extraordinary needs for the best available opportunities. In the six months following the Geneva Agreement we had to readjust rapidly to new conditions on a crash basis. This is particularly true in Vietnam, for a year ago the problem was to try to hold Free Vietnam together for at least a year under circumstances which looked bleak and unpromising. Immediate action on all fronts was the insistent requirement. But now all three countries appear to be in a process of settling down to new patterns. There are still many difficulties and grave dangers facing each country and our aid programs, but the Chairman pointed out the situation in each of the Associated States, with a possible exception of Laos, appears to have stabilized enough to look into the possibility of recasting our aid programs on a longer range basis.</p>
<p>In reply to a question from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName>, the Chairman emphasized that the situation in all three countries is just as critical as ever but that there were perhaps greater opportunities for reaching results and for sustaining our efforts than six to twelve months ago when the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ‘55 and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ‘56 programs were readjusted to Geneva. Whereas a year ago we were working on a crash basis to enable the Associated States to survive, today these states appear reasonably established. The Chairman noted that the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government in Vietnam has consolidated its power and authority against non-communist political minorities and is proceeding to reconstitute the form and structure of its government. In Cambodia elections have been held, a single party <pb xml:id="pg_556" n="556" facs="0586"/>now commands authority, and real as well as institutional power is now merged in Prince <persName corresp="#p_SN1">Sihanouk</persName>. In Laos, the problem of communist control in the two northern provinces is a delicate situation, but in the rest of the countries there have been favorable developments. Consequently, the Chairman noted that the State Department has been searching for several weeks for methods of re-examining and recasting our aid programs, if the working group should agree that it would be necessary. In this connection the Chairman called the group’s attention to Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>’s report of October 6,<note n="2" xml:id="d263fn2">For text of <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>’s report of his study mission to Southeast Asia on behalf of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, see “Report by Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mike Mansfield</persName>, Viet Nam, Cambodia, and Laos”, 84th Cong., 1st sess., Committee Print (Washington, Government Printing Office, 1955).</note> recommending a special mission to Vietnam and a careful review of all our programs in Cambodia and Laos.</p>
<p>In the discussion that followed there appeared to be a general consensus that a re-examination and review would be desirable in principle. It was decided that a joint telegram should be sent to Saigon, Vientiane and Phnom Penh<note n="3" xml:id="d263fn3">No telegram as described has been found in Department of State files.</note> outlining the group’s view as to the needs of our aid programs, asking the missions to discuss this matter with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> during their visit. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Price</persName> of State, Mr. Bunting of <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> and Mr. Sandri of Defense were designated to work up a first draft of such a telegram.</p>
<p>The question was raised as to where the costing mission to Vietnam<note n="4" xml:id="d263fn4">On September 9, <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gordon Gray</persName> of the Department of Defense suggested sending a small interagency survey team to Saigon for a month to seek ways to reduce the cost to the United States of supporting Vietnamese armed forces. The Embassy in Saigon, the Department of State, and <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> agreed to the proposal and the team was organized and scheduled to leave at the beginning of November. (Memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> dated October 17 with attached letter dated September 9 from <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>; Department of State, Central Files, 751G.5–MSP/9–955)</note> would fit into a re-examination of the aid programs. For his part, the Chairman stated that the costing mission was extremely important, should be sent out as soon as possible and could be considered as one element in arriving at the over-all picture. Mr. Landon pointed out that an inter-departmental study was being prepared on Pakistan which was somewhat along the line of today’s discussion. It seemed to be the consensus of the group that two studies could be developed for the Associated States. First, a costing mission should be set up to make a sixty-day survey. The findings of this mission could then be incorporated in a broader survey made by a high-level mission over a period of three to six months. The purpose of such studies would be to establish guidelines for U.S. operations in the Associated States during the next few years.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_557" n="557" facs="0587"/>
<p>Mr. Landon then made the suggestion that a plan of operations might be developed for each of the Associated States which would be an advantage over the usual outline plan of operations, which is primarily a description of what things U.S. agencies are planning to do in the immediate future. It was pointed out that an outline plan of operations for each of the Associated States might be part of the development of a longer range plan on extensive field surveys. The sort of long-range operating plans contained in <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> D–23<note n="5" xml:id="d263fn5"><gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> D–23, “U.S. Psychological Strategy Based on Thailand”, September 14, 1953, not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 790.5/9–1453)</note> for Thailand might be an example.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Closure of the Consulate at Hanoi<note n="6" xml:id="d263fn6">The American Consulate in Hanoi was never officially “recognized” by <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> authorities, and after they took control of Hanoi they placed restrictions and limitations on Consulate personnel and engaged in intermittent harassment of the Consulate. On September 26, however, they ordered the Consulate to cease using its radio transmitter and receiver and took the action as described above. Until this time the Consulate had submitted monthly political and economic reports as well as other telegrams which are <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 751G.00 file; documentation relating to harassment and closure of the Consulate is also <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 122.4564 file. The Consulate closed on December 11, 1955.</note></p>
<p>The closure of the U.S. Consulate at Hanoi was discussed, including a proposed press release which had been drafted and was being cleared in the State Department. It was brought out that by attrition the Consulate was running out of supplies. It would be impossible to continue without having the ability to rotate personnel and to replenish supplies, and the communists had refused such permission. Consul <persName corresp="#p_CTJ1">Corcoran</persName> was authorized to work out the closure of the post and the withdrawal of the personnel.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Situation in Laos</p>
<p>Lack of progress in negotiations between the Lao and Pathet Lao was discussed and it was brought out that this subject might be discussed shortly at Geneva. The Defense Department is progressing rapidly in the selection of a military group for Laos. The chief and some of his staff have already been chosen. The total group will number about 20 and they will proceed to Laos as part of the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> staff. The departure of the members already selected is awaiting action by Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>.</p>
<p>The Defense member outlined various air transportation problems for Laos, and during the discussion various alternative solutions were mentioned, recognizing that the problem remained to be solved.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Relations with Cambodia</p>
<p>The problems facing U.S. agencies doing business with the Cambodian Government were explored. It was pointed out that we have <pb xml:id="pg_558" n="558" facs="0588"/>been going along without an economic aid agreement. The question is whether we should continue on that basis, or should press for an agreement. The possibilities of putting pressure on the Cambodian Ambassador in Washington were discussed, recognizing his personal friendship with the new Prime Minister. It was agreed that the U.S. can be expected to have a difficult time with the Cambodian Government, as the Cambodians apparently agree with difficulty to the terms of other nations. At present the Cambodians apparently want the U.S. to turn over dollar support to them, for them to use first and to account for later.</p>
<p>During the discussion it was brought out that the problem of force levels in Cambodia had been referred to the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and a decision is expected within two or three weeks. This study is in accordance with the Ambassador’s request for a review of the subject in Washington.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">5. U.S. Business Interests</p>
<p>The Commerce member indicated that his Department was very much interested in the development of U.S. business with the Associated States; that techniques for trade need to be developed with Cambodia and Laos. He mentioned that U.S. business interests are familiar with the Saigon trade but not with other States.</p>
<p>A word of caution was given by one member of the working group regarding crash-basis planning versus long-range planning, pointing out that Vietnam is still in a critical situation and will be for a year or more. There seemed to be no disagreement with this observation.</p>
<p>Reference was made to the Progress Report on Southeast Asia (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5405)<note n="7" xml:id="d263fn7">Dated December 21, not printed.</note> and it was thought that a first draft might be ready for the next meeting of the working group<note n="8" xml:id="d263fn8">A report of this meeting is in a memorandum of discussion by Landon, October 18.

In view strength Viet Minh organization in North and their unknown capability in South, development strong stable executive leadership in Vietnam should have priority. Such representative and constitutional processes should be developed to extent that they do not weaken central authority.

<p rend="center">POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC MEASURES IN EVENT OF A RENEWAL OF AGGRESSION IN VIET-NAM</p>
<p>The following study is submitted in response to the Planning Board Memorandum of August 16<note n="2" xml:id="d265fn2"><ref target="#d244">Document 244</ref>.</note> which called for a State Department “study of political and economic measures which would be required in support of the operations” which are described in the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense dated 9 September<note n="3" xml:id="d265fn3">Enclosure to Memo for <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>, “U.S. Policy in the Event of a Renewal of Aggression in Vietnam”, September 16, 1955. [Footnote in the source text; see <ref target="#d254">Document 254</ref>.]</note> “including preparatory steps which might have a deterrent effect.”</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Political:</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Deterrent</hi></p>
<p>1. The most important political action which the US could take to deter overt Viet Minh aggression would be a clear reaffirmation in official public statements of US intention to take vigorous action under the protocol to the Manila Pact in the event of such aggression.</p>
<p>2. Similar statements from other members of the Manila Pact would also provide a useful deterrent.</p>
<p>3. Possibilities of securing such statements would be affected by the degree to which the Government of Viet Nam could make it clear that the onus for any such aggression would lie with the Viet Minh. Similarly, demonstration by the Government of Viet Nam of its determination and intent to maintain itself as an independent anti-communist country will assist in securing for it international support and will serve as a deterrent to Viet Minh aggression. Accordingly, the US should continue to prevail upon the Government of Free Viet Nam to follow courses of action which will assist in such developments. In particular it should attempt to persuade the Government of Free Viet Nam to establish a National Assembly as soon as possible which would be endowed with authority to draw up a constitution <pb xml:id="pg_561" n="561" facs="0591"/>to determine the relationship of Viet Nam with France and other countries, and declare the official position of Free Viet Nam with respect to the pre-election consultations with the Viet Minh and the elections called for under the Geneva agreement.</p>
<p>4. The US could also undertake political action to assist in establishing military deterrents to aggression such as arranging facilities for introduction of US mobile ground forces into the Southeast Asian area should such commitment of forces be decided upon. US political action would also be helpful if improvement of bases in Thailand or other areas in Southeast Asia were required.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Action in the Event of Aggression</hi></p>
<p>5. In the event of Viet Minh overt aggression, the US should stimulate an official Viet Namese request to the Manila Pact signatories for assistance under the protocol to the Pact and Article IV of the treaty. The US should strongly support the Viet Namese request and use its influence to secure action by the members of the Pact under their treaty obligation.</p>
<p>6. The US should stimulate and assist a Viet Nam initiative to bring the issue to the Security Council of the United Nations in an effort to secure condemnation of the Viet Minh and a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution calling for a cessation of aggression. The US should consider in the light of the circumstances at the time whether or not it should seek designation as United Nations Commander in an organized <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action.</p>
<p>7. The US would undoubtedly have to insist that a supreme command of any forces contributed either under the Manila Pact or under the United Nations should be vested in the US. The US would have to arrange for such command in a way to avoid derogation of the sovereignty of Free Viet Nam. It should emphasize that Free Viet Nam had formerly called upon its Manila Pact protectors to deploy troops within its territory to repel Viet Minh aggression. It should emphasize the fact that US exercise of supreme command and the presence of foreign forces in Viet Nam were strictly temporary phenomena and should allay any suspicion that the US intended to establish a colonial regime.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Economic:</p>
<p>8. Viet Minh aggression and consequent introduction of foreign troops into Free Viet Nam would seriously upset the Viet Namese economic pattern. The production of paddy and rubber would be further reduced. Support of forces would necessarily come from abroad. Viet Nam would become even more dependent upon foreign aid. Military necessity would require Viet Nam to accept increased foreign control of its economic affairs. Matters such as foreign exchange, <pb xml:id="pg_562" n="562" facs="0592"/>and international trade would have to be delegated to the Supreme Military Command. The US would have to be prepared to extend substantial economic assistance to Viet Nam and to exercise a considerable degree of economic authority.</p>

<p>1. We fully share Department’s concern that central authority of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> govt not be weakened by premature creation unruly Assembly. We believe, however, that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> govt can be depended on not to permit such situation to arise, and that greater danger exists that once government has developed stable executive leadership, it may postpone broadening democratic base of govt beyond point where this both feasible and desirable. Optimum procedure and timetable clearly dependent on a number of variables, many of which we cannot hope to influence, and some of which are not yet fully known.</p>
<p>2. Assessment of when Assembly elections can and should be held depends on type of elections (which not yet decided), evidence (yet to be shown) of govt ability to organize elections, and indication (as yet inconclusive) of general temper of electorate.</p>
<p>3. Present govt program has advantage of proceeding in stages from safest to most risky step, and of permitting thereby progress in implementing subsequent steps to be predicated on results of earlier ones. It can be assumed that govt’s decision regarding both date and type of elections for National Assembly will be dependent on: (a) results of referenda and communal and municipal elections; (b) progress in development efficient party organization with suitable candidates; and (c) general political climate prevailing at time, including internal and external pressures for such elections.</p>
<p>4. Actual method of bringing about National Assembly, choice of which will depend on factors mentioned in para 3, could vary from actually holding direct elections to extreme of appointing one and having it confirmed by third referendum. Plan to hold direct elections in December seems highly unrealistic in view of: (a) time <pb xml:id="pg_563" n="563" facs="0593"/>required to prepare mechanics of elections (including screening of candidates) and government’s lack of experience in field; (b) inadequacy of present organization of government parties in terms waging campaign and presenting suitable candidates; and (c) unstable security conditions still prevailing in parts of south and center. We believe that, if direct elections are held, they will be postponed beyond December, and that if original schedule adhered to, some procedure other than direct elections will be resorted to. Subject to evidence yet to unfold in coming weeks, we continue to view indirect elections as best suited to overall situation, and solution most likely eventually to be adopted.</p>
<p>5. Kind of Assembly which would result from elections at any specified time depends, of course, on factors mentioned in para 2 and on degree to which elections are controlled (i.e. screening of candidates and voters, intimidation of opposition, freedom of electioneering, etc.). As Department is aware, any estimate of actual relative strength of parties and groups in Free Vietnam today is highly speculative in view of absence of any previous free expression of popular will and absence of any legal means for anti-<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> elements to voice their views today. It is highly doubtful, however, that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> supporters would command a majority in South Vietnam today in completely free direct elections for an Assembly. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would presumably fare better in center. As stated above, however, we believe <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> can be counted on to proceed cautiously, and to see to it that Assembly if and when created contains comfortable govt majority. <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> have already indicated that they would like to form focal point of legal opposition to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> within Assembly around which other anti-Communist elements opposed to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could gather. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> himself has indicated a preference for the emergence of a two-party system similiar to US model rather than a plethora of parties along French style. Whether <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would ever permit creation of opposition of type envisaged by <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> is questionable. It would certainly depend, at very least, on his conviction that his own majority would be substantial.</p>

</list>
<p>On October 11, 1955, the Intelligence Advisory Committee approved an estimate of probable developments in Vietnam to July 1956. The principal conclusions of this estimate were:</p>
<p>1. At least until July 1956, the Viet Minh will probably continue to concentrate primarily on a “political struggle” designed to exert pressure for implementation of the Geneva agreements and to bring to power in the south personalities amenable to coalition government with the Viet Minh.</p>
<p>2. The Communists probably recognize, however, that unless they effectively challenge the position of the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government the latter will gradually strengthen and stabilize its position. They might therefore decide to initiate guerrilla warfare in the south, provided such action was consistent with over-all Bloc policies and provided they estimated that such a course would not provoke Manila Pact counteractions.</p>
<p>3. Should the Viet Minh initiate large-scale guerrilla operations, supported by substantial infiltration from the north, the south Vietnamese government could not long survive without military assistance from outside. However, the Vietnamese National Army probably could maintain the government in power against potential Viet Minh opposition now in South Vietnam, and could retain control of major urban centers and lines of communication.</p>
<p>4. If <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> continues to receive wholehearted US support, he will probably be able to cope successfully with non-Communist dissident elements.</p>
<p>5. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will almost certainly not agree to hold national elections for the unification of Vietnam by July 1956. Although <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, under Western pressure, might reluctantly agree to indirect consultations with the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> concerning elections, he would insist on conditions which he felt certain the Communists would be unable to accept. Aware that such a position will probably cause the Viet Minh to increase their efforts to destroy his government, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will probably seek to bind the US more specifically to the defense of Vietnam.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_565" n="565" facs="0595"/>

<p>1846. 1. On basis information available 7 p.m. October 25 <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> referendum characterized by (a) energetic, one-sided pre-election campaign in favor <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, (b) absence of freedom for opposition propaganda, (c) large participation in voting, (d) secrecy of balloting, (e) apparently honest tabulation of votes, (f) orderliness of voting and absence any serious incidents before, during or after voting, and (g) landslide for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> (approximately 98 percent of votes).<note n="2" xml:id="d268fn2">According to telegram 1849 from Saigon, October 26, the final official results were: for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> 5,960,302 (98.2 percent); for <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> 63,017 (1.1 percent); invalid votes 44,155 (0.7 percent). (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/10–2655)</note></p>
<p>2. First conclusion is that referendum proved resounding success for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government. Results do not necessarily prove <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> commands even majority support in Free Vietnam, in view <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> lack of popularity, but show government able to carry out almost unchallenged popular consultation. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s success lay less in victory percentage than in large turnout and fact voting carried out in democratic fashion without significant incidents.</p>
<p>3. Referendum would also seem to indicate Viet Minh potential for creating political disorder has been generally overestimated. Although Communists may not have wished become openly identified with <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> or create open disorder at this juncture, it hard to believe they would have willingly permitted such an impressive show of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government strength (which bound to increase <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> prestige at expense of Communists) go unchallenged. Hanoi Radio had carried strong appeals to voters to boycott referendum. Except in few areas where Hoa Hao fighting taking place, participation generally over 90 percent of registered voters.</p>
<p>4. Anti-Communist nationalists opposed to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in south have attempted belittle referendum and have claimed people irked by one-sided <pb xml:id="pg_566" n="566" facs="0596"/>pro-<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> campaign. Again fact so few persons apparently voted against <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in spite of opportunity would tend to cast serious doubts validity this claim.</p>
<p>5. Finally it would seem to us that results referendum render unlikely <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> will be able to play significant role in future. Fact he so overwhelmingly repudiated in Free Vietnam means not only that he can expect little indigenous support but renders also improbable <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> regime or Communist bloc in general will consider <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> useful tool for their purposes.</p>
<p>6. We have impression that government leaders are pleasantly surprised at their own success, and that electorate, particularly the women, enjoyed new experience.<note n="3" xml:id="d268fn3">More detail and analysis by the Embassy of the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> referendum is in <ref target="#d278">Document 278</ref>.</note></p>

<p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Fred</persName>: The first stage in Viet-Nam’s political transformation has taken place, perhaps with better results and in a more convincing manner than what had been expected, although I am sure we have not heard the last from <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and his entourage. This plebiscite and the rejection of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> in Free Viet-Nam came upon us rather suddenly and obliquely. It turned out all right but it might have run off the tracks. I wish that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and his people had given us a little more forewarning and official notification of their intentions and their program. There were one or two tricky aspects of this plebiscite. For example, it now may mean that the Republic of Viet-Nam is limited de facto to the area south of the 17th parallel, for that is the only territory in which the voting was conducted, while the State of Viet-Nam has covered the entire territory of Viet-Nam juridically speaking. However, this may not be of much real importance since it has clarified <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s status, removed <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s hand, and the Viet Minh control of the north anyway. At this point we are not certain <pb xml:id="pg_567" n="567" facs="0597"/>what, if anything, will happen at the Foreign Ministers talks in Geneva. According to <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Walter Robertson</persName> and Doug MacArthur, the Secretary was adamant against any four power discussion of non-agenda items.<note n="2" xml:id="d269fn2">The formal expression of the Secretary’s view that the Foreign Ministers Conference at Geneva, October 27–November 16, 1955, should limit its discussion to the agenda questions of Germany and European security, disarmament, and developments of contacts between east and west is set forth in telegram 1397 to Paris, October 12. (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.; Central Files, 396.1–GE/10–1255)</note> However, <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> Viet-Nam should be taken up at Geneva,<note n="3" xml:id="d269fn3">A report of <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName>’s discussion with <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> in Moscow, including reference to Indochina, is attached to a memorandum of discussion between <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and the Canadian Ambassador, by Outerbridge Horsey, Director of the Office of British Commonwealth and Northern European Affairs, October 14. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> Secretary’s Memoranda of Conversation: Lot 64 D 199)</note> and the British, somewhat chagrined over their dangling role of co-Chairman, seem resigned and susceptible. Perhaps we can hold off until an assembly is formed in Viet-Nam.</p>
<p>We are now thinking here of what comes next politically in Viet-Nam, but we are not altogether clear about the next two stages as reported in your 1468 of September 28.<note n="4" xml:id="d269fn4">See <ref target="#d259fn2">footnote 2, Document 259</ref>.</note> The second referendum is a little over four weeks away if still held. Again the press will plague us for comments and guidance on the draft constitution as well as elections on the national assembly. I hope that the Embassy can send in copies of the constitution as soon as available. Also we would depend a great deal on the normal reporting of the political thinking and decisions regarding the constitution and the elections.</p>
<p>I was very interested in your 1672 of October 14<note n="5" xml:id="d269fn5"><ref target="#d266">Document 266</ref>.</note> replying to our 1192.<note n="6" xml:id="d269fn6"><ref target="#d264">Document 264</ref>.</note> There certainly are a number of unknown and variable factors which confirm the practical advantage of the government’s program of proceeding in stages from the safest to the most risky step. I am still worried about the complexion and consequences of an assembly, although I appreciate the need for some democratic process. The lads in Policy Planning are also worried about this same thing. So, in my view also, indirect elections would seem best suited at this time, or perhaps the timing could be pushed back. If a national assembly is created in December or January, then political problems as well as economic matters will probably come to a head in the first six months of 1956. We assume here an assembly would oppose the Geneva declaration on elections and also direct consultations with the Viet Minh. What will the latter do then?</p>
<p>In connection with my comment above on the reporting, I wonder if we in the Department were not too critical and stringent when we were talking with you and <persName corresp="#p_ADV1">Dan Anderson</persName> regarding telegraphic volume while <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SPJ1">Sturm</persName> were in Saigon. We spoke <pb xml:id="pg_568" n="568" facs="0598"/>of this so often and with such feeling that we may have inadvertently left the impression that telegraphic correspondence to and from Saigon should be cut to the bone. Perhaps we have gone to the other extreme in our own telegrams to you. I wonder if we are filling you in adequately and quickly enough on the Washington aspects of Vietnamese as well as general problems. If we are not, please let me know. By the same token, I would not be at all adverse to seeing some increase in the political reporting by telegram from the Embassy. I think there are some aspects of the plebiscite that could have been reported to us that would have helped in establishing our general outlook towards it and in our handling of the press. Just for example, it would have helped us if we had had a report on the type of ballot, the organization of the referendum and the conditions under which it would be held. These were all questions which the press began asking us as soon as the announcement was made in Saigon. We were somewhat handicapped in not having a summary from the Embassy. I mention this matter of reporting because there continues to be a very great interest in the future of Viet-Nam in high levels in the United States Government, and we need plenty of background information in dealing with the British and French Governments which we do via the Embassies here. I have discussed this item of reporting with <persName corresp="#p_HRE1">Bob Hoey</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KPM1">Paul Kattenburg</persName> to be sure I have the right perspective.</p>

<p>2157. ReDeptel 1704.<note n="2" xml:id="d270fn2">In this telegram, October 27, the Department informed the Embassy of the gist of a conversation on that same day with French Embassy officials in which Department officers expressed concern that Franco-Vietnamese military discussions were suspended. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/10–2555)</note> <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> seized occasion our visit this morning to raise subject Franco-Vietnamese relations. Speaking personally, he said he aware “equivocal” nature French policy towards Vietnam in March/April period this year, Binh Xuyen role etc, and he wished tell us he had been personally distressed by it (this first time key <pb xml:id="pg_569" n="569" facs="0599"/>French official has made such statement and we would appreciate source not being quoted). However, <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> said, French had adopted different line thereafter as we well knew. But, he said, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s handling of France recently making job French officials concerned with <gloss target="#t_IC1">IC</gloss> affairs almost impossible. <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> said he wanted us to know that it had not been easy obtain French position supporting results referendum and jettisoning <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. French elements traditionally hostile <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and favorable <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> had been overpowered, but not without difficulty. Instead of any gesture on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s part to release two French officers<note n="3" xml:id="d270fn3">The reference is to a Franco-Vietnamese difference over the arrest by Vietnamese authorities of two French military officers charged with bombing electric power stations in Saigon. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> announced his intention of trying these two officers in Vietnamese courts and the French refused to proceed with the military talks until the officers were turned over to their custody. (Telegrams 1460 and 1757 from Paris, September 29 and October 14; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/9–2955 and 751G.00/10–1455, respectively)</note> following referendum as had been hoped, <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> noted that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had only seen fit thus far to renounce Franco-Vietnamese commercial agreement<note n="4" xml:id="d270fn4">According to telegram 1927 from Saigon, November 2, the Vietnamese Government on October 31 denounced the Franco-Vietnamese Monetary and Commercial Agreement which was to come into effect December 31. If not renegotiated, denunciation of this agreement would eliminate the 15 percent French customs tariff preference and the requirement that all foreign exchange, including U.S. dollar aid to Vietnam, pass through the French stabilization fund. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.5–MSP/11–255)</note> (we gathered <persName corresp="#p_HH1">Hoppenot</persName> will approach <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> re opening talks this score).</p>
<p>Re <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> (and we took occasion confirm to <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> substance Dept’s conversation Pelletier contained <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>), <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> made clear that internal French political situation militated against French Govt agreeing talks prior settlement two officer question plus fact it unlikely military talks could take place in favorable atmosphere while this question still in abeyance. <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> reiterated that as soon this question settled, France ready begin talks and continued remain disposed consider Vietnamese request for retention residual force. Re latter consideration, <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> said they under impression training and development <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> thus far had failed come up to expectations, that <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> ability fill gap that would be created by <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> withdrawal questionable, and that <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Saigon shared this view (we declined discuss on basis no info). <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> stressed, however, French political pressures mounting for complete and immediate withdrawal <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> and that if two officer question not resolved soon so that talks could begin, there would be nothing talk about.</p>
<p>(In talking subsequently <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName>’s deputy, latter reiterated impossibility obtaining French Govt agreement open military talks until question two officers resolved, and questioned utility holding such talks until air cleared this regard. We asked what effect complete <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> withdrawal would have on Fr military missions Cambodia, Laos, <pb xml:id="pg_570" n="570" facs="0600"/>and French units Seno. <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName>’s deputy stressed while complete <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> withdrawal from South Vietnam would not affect French military training missions Cambodia and Laos, it likely result in pressure pull French units out of Seno as part policy liquidation all French military bases <gloss target="#t_IC1">IC</gloss>.)</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> With <gloss target="#t_IC1">IC</gloss> affairs now lodged in Quai, <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Jacques Roux</persName> becomes in our opinion key voice as regards <gloss target="#t_IC1">IC</gloss> in French official circles. We have always found him disposed take objective view <gloss target="#t_IC1">IC</gloss> matters and we have gained impression he has always taken lead in French official circles to effect rapprochement between French and United States views when divergences occurred. He in effect this morning admitted that while past hadn’t been all that it might, basis for continued Franco-Vietnamese cooperation can still be found if Vietnamese willing and if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> prepared take into account French position sensibilities and follow more adroit line in dealing with French. <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> conveyed impression he thought question two officers had been allowed assume level out of all proportion merits and that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> might have handled denunciation commercial agreement in manner less likely offend French sensibilities and at least not timed it for morrow referendum.</p>
<p>We feel <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> and Quai disposed try help and cooperate with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> govt; for that reason we feel <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should try strengthen hand this group to extent possible. From here, it looks as though law diminishing returns has long since run its course on two officers and that gesture from <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> this regard only practical hope getting military talks under way. We continue see no way getting French agree to begin talks until question officers resolved.</p>
<p>It not entirely clear to us here, however, exactly what Vietnamese trying achieve in military talks. If Vietnamese feel <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> not ready take over responsibilities now assumed by <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> and really wish see French military presence retained, they must realize that the burden is upon them to convince French military keep residual force South Vietnam since, according our info, French are not prepared pay very high price for privilege retaining troops South Vietnam for prestige reasons with risk possible eventual involvement in hostilities with Vietminh. In fact, all evidence points to early and complete withdrawal <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> unless Vietnamese persuade French remain. We presume that Vietnamese Delegation would not have been willing to pursue and exhaust in course some two months at Paris possibility obtaining French agreement Vietnamese terms for retention residual force South Vietnam if they had not hoped way might be found do so. Otherwise, we presume Vietnamese Delegation on arrival Paris in Aug would have expressed desire to negotiate purely and simply terms withdrawal <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> along lines agreed prior departure and would not have engaged in what was perhaps a useful but unrealistic exercise <pb xml:id="pg_571" n="571" facs="0601"/>to satisfy themselves French not prepared enter into written engagement of nature desired by them as basis retention <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> force South Vietnam. As consequence, we strongly feel that when and if military talks do begin, Vietnamese Delegation come Paris either prepared seek complete withdrawal <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> or if they wish retention <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> force, they reconcile themselves to reaching compromise solution with French on Vietnamese preconditions posed by <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>.</p>

<p>During President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s discussion of his urgent need for village auto-defense units,<note n="2" xml:id="d271fn2">For a memorandum of this portion of the conversation, see <ref target="#d276">Document 276</ref>.</note> I asked him to clarify his long-term intentions with respect to the police organization of Viet-Nam. In reply to my several questions, he said it was his definite purpose to develop in Vietnam a police system along the lines which had been recommended consisting of Metropolitan Police, Garde Civile for the countryside and the National Sûreté. He made it very clear that it was not his intention that the Garde Civile should be an adjunct to the army, but he went on to say that it was inevitable that for some time it would have, in effect, to function in large measure as an auxiliary force to the military. Until the widespread illegal possession of arms had been reduced to manageable proportions and the Viet Minh capability for armed intervention in the countryside had been removed, it made little sense to expose the yet inadequately trained and inadequately armed Garde Civile to the sub-machine gun fire of Viet Minh guerrillas. The process of pacification had still a long way to go before it would be possible for members of the Garde Civile to patrol the countryside in groups of two or three as do the rural police of less disturbed countries. He added that one of the causes of confusion with respect to the development of the Garde Civile was the old-fashioned view of some of the bureaucrats in the Ministry of the Interior who still seemed to think of the Garde Civile as a sort of <pb xml:id="pg_572" n="572" facs="0602"/>honor guard for a Chef de Province. They did not recognize the critical nature of the present emergency and resisted his orders that units of the Garde be assigned to the military in circumstances where this was required. He commented in passing that, in the Philippines, President Magsaysay had apparently not yet reached the point where he felt he could return his Garde Civile to the Ministry of the Interior where it, of course, belonged.</p>

<p>1. The Chairman referred to Soviet efforts in connection with the Geneva provisions for elections to unify North and South Vietnam, and commented that the Soviet Government had suggested a consultative conference between the two zones to encourage the idea of such elections. The Soviets have been talking with the British and <pb xml:id="pg_573" n="573" facs="0603"/>apparently are prepared to exert some pressure to secure the desired elections.<note n="2" xml:id="d272fn2">For an account of such pressure, see the letter from <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</note></p>
<p>2. The Chairman then introduced Col. <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">E.G. Lansdale</persName> and Lt. Rufus Phillips, from Saigon, who have been engaged in special activities in connection with the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government. Their joint observations in substance were:</p>
<p>a. Our work in Vietnam was aimed to bring about unity between the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government and the general population in order to offset any attraction the communist Viet Minh state might have for the people. One problem was how to overcome the suspicions of the various political and religious groups in Vietnam. The political parties tended to act in a clandestine fashion, regardless of whether they were in support of, or in opposition to, the government. They knew no other way to operate as a result of their colonial experience. Our problem, in part, was to develop open politics so that problems could be discussed openly and democratic processes would be possible.</p>
<p>b. The main target of the communists was the army of Vietnam and not directly the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government. Our efforts were aimed to improve the morale of the army, and its relations with the village population. It was a new army and had no code of behavior. In the beginning the soldiers went about with their families like gypsies and would go through a village community like a cloud of locusts, depriving them of their rice and their pigs. As a consequence, the people would welcome Viet Minh soldiers more than the Vietnamese. Our program, in the beginning, concentrated on teaching the soldiers how soldiers should behave. Camps were set up for their families and proper procurement methods were used to feed and care for the soldiers. The methods used proved successful and the population became friendly to the army when they saw that the army behaved properly. This led to improved intelligence on communist activities. Campaigns carried on against the Hoa Hao demonstrated the success of these methods because the Vietnamese Army was dependent upon the villagers for support.</p>
<p>c. There was also a heavy training program to prepare the Vietnamese Army to fight. Their morale was developed to a high point and they became very cocky. Their campaign against the Binh Xuyen gave them experience. Where the French had failed, the Vietnamese succeeded in the swamps of the southern part of the country. The troops marched through swamps and defeated the Binh Xuyen. The leadership of the army was important, as the general officers had advanced rapidly from being lieutenants and captains. They learned obedience, but as generals they had to learn how to think. Leaders were frequently from favored families and had been educated outside <pb xml:id="pg_574" n="574" facs="0604"/>of Vietnam, usually in France. They did not understand the mental attitudes of their own troops. A new course of training was launched to accustom officers and troops to be together. They were put in teams of 100 without distinction of rank, and for five weeks they lived and trained together. Those who showed ability received automatic raises in rank and those who failed were dropped as officers. The Vietnamese Government is cooperating to develop a tough officer staff which can work with the troops. There is a new spirit in the army and the officer corps.</p>
<p>d. Earlier, when the army moved into a Viet Minh area, the communists used scorched-earth tactics. The Vietnamese Army developed a relief system for the stricken population by distributing rice, reconstructing roads, and opening wells. When the people saw the Vietnamese Army behave better than the communist army, the populace gave them their loyalty and every possible support. The reason was the concrete and substantive relief which the army brought to the people.</p>
<p>e. Operation Brotherhood,<note n="3" xml:id="d272fn3">Operation Brotherhood was a program sponsored by the International Junior Chambers of Commerce and strongly endorsed and aided by <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName>. Under the program, Filipino doctors and nurses volunteered for medical duty in free clinics in South Vietnam. For <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName>’s account of the operation, see <hi rend="italic">In the Midst of Wars</hi>, pp. 168–170.</note> supported by the Philippines, gave an added psychological support in convincing the people that they were being considered not only by their own govenment but by foreign governments.</p>
<p>f. Viet Minh promises have been counter-productive as a result of the good treatment provided by the Vietnamese Army. The communists had promised land reform and the fulfillment of all dreams, but, as time dragged on and nothing happened, the people became tired of the communists and in some regions the communists suffered a psychological defeat. This was less true, however, in the South where the communists remained strong. Many people in this area accepted the communists’ promise to return in 1956.</p>
<p>g. A Civic Action Program was started last January by the Vietnamese Government in an effort to teach government officials to serve the people and to convince the people that their officials were interested in them. Groups of bureaucrats were made to dress like peasants and to work in teams with the villagers to get them to understand their own problems. These government employees were drawn from several ministries and attempted to help people solve their own public health problems, their irrigation problems, their educational problems, their legal problems, and others. A team would begin by launching a village council and getting the village council to express its problems, and then to discuss possible solutions. They <pb xml:id="pg_575" n="575" facs="0605"/>erected schools and meeting halls and brought the central government and the villages psychologically closer together. The Prime Minister believes that this program is his main hope for the future. It is still run on a financial shoestring. Civic Action Teams have already been in 10 provinces and the hope is to have them in every district in Vietnam by January 1956. The teams are not tied in with any political parties.</p>
<p>Some <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> money is being devoted to Civic Action programs and it is expected that more will be utilized in 1956. In this connection <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>’s A–256, of October 7,<note n="4" xml:id="d272fn4"><gloss target="#t_Toica1">Toica</gloss> A–256, October 7, was a 22-page despatch consisting of <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName>’s optimistic description of the “Civic Action” program as conceived by its sponsors and <persName corresp="#p_LW1">Wolf Ladejinsky</persName>’s more guarded appraisal based on 3 days of field observation. (Washington National Records Center, <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> Message Files: <gloss target="#t_FRC1">FRC</gloss> 57 A 248, Box 104, Vietnam)</note> provides the first official despatch on this subject. (A draft telegram was distributed during the discussion to query Saigon about Civic Action programs for 1956 in the light of A-256 of October 7.) Considerable <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> material is already being utilized in the various ministries and <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> kits are in evidence in the field. As yet there is no official Vietnamese Government request for aid in the Civic Action Program, as it is not yet regarded as a program separate from the diverse programs in the various ministries. The activities of the various ministries are coordinated by a Mr. Kung who dresses as a villager and mingles with the people. It will probably be necessary to provide him with some additional financial strength but the intention is to avoid building a separate ministry devoted to civic action or community development. This is a program, at any rate, that is strictly Vietnamese and U.S. assistance is peripheral.</p>
<p>Instruction as to civic responsibility is provided by the Ministry of Information. Part of the problem has been to avoid the errors of the communists in promising too much from civic action. Actions speak louder than words and so the Ministry of Information people have been restrained from promising too much. The program is aimed to give practical activation and to help villagers to solve their own problems.</p>
<p>h. In the South, if the communists start terrorist actions of which they are capable, the Vietnamese Army is confident they could defeat them. Politically, communists have capabilities in the government and in the villages so this is a race between our counter-subversives and the communist-subversives. The communists are very tough and difficult to cope with, and they are well-trained. On the government side many political-minded people engage in counter-subversion. A civilian watch group is being developed to help report on the communist groups.

<p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster</persName>: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> called on me, at his own request, on November 4, and spoke about Vietnam, and particularly the message addressed to him and to myself by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> on October 31. The text of this message has already been communicated to your Government, as well as to the remaining Members of the Geneva Conference and the three Supervisory Powers, but I enclose another copy for ease of reference.<note n="2" xml:id="d273fn2">Not found attached. A text of <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>’s letter to the Geneva cochairmen is in <gloss target="#t_Tosec1">Tosec</gloss> 189 to Geneva, November 7. In this letter <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> stated that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> had made numerous efforts to implement the provisions of the Geneva Accords calling for free elections, but was rebuffed by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName>’s government’s refusal, openly supported by the United States, to hold consultations on the issue. <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> went on to charge that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was in fact bound by the Geneva Agreements as a successor government to the French who signed on behalf of South Vietnam. Finally, <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> argued that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s statement that conditions in North Vietnam precluded consultations was untenable because those conditions were precisely what should be discussed at the consultative conference. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>/<gloss>SEA</gloss> Files: Lot 58 D 266, Vietnam—Geneva, Nov. 1955)</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> and I are to meet again on November 10, having agreed that we could not have any useful discussion before the Chinese message had been circulated.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> and I discussed Vietnam in New York at the end of September and I then suggested that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> must be allowed to consolidate his own internal position before he could be expected to move towards elections of the kind envisaged by the Geneva Agreements. On November 4 Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> pointed out that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had still made no such move.</p>
<p>At our meeting on November 10, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> may bring up, in addition to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>’s letter, the Fourth Interim Report of the International Supervisory Commission for Vietnam. Copies of this <pb xml:id="pg_577" n="577" facs="0607"/>will eventually be communicated to your Government in the usual way, but I enclose one for your confidential advance information.<note n="3" xml:id="d273fn3">Not found attached. For text, see Great Britain, Parliamentary Papers by Command, “Fourth Interim Report of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam, April 11, 1955–August 10, 1955”. (London, Her Majesty’s Stationery Office, <hi rend="italic">Cmd. 9654</hi>, 1955)</note> It is severely critical of the Vietnamese attitude towards the Geneva Agreements and in paragraph 45 calls for action by the two Co-Chairmen. A similar suggestion, you will remember, was made some time ago by the Government of India. On top of all this, Vietminh and Chinese propaganda about the Vietnamese evasion of the Geneva Agreements has recently increased and sharpened, while Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> continues to refuse the least gesture towards compliance. It looks as though the Communists are not prepared to acquiesce in our stalling tactics for much longer.</p>
<p>I have certain suggestions for dealing with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>’s likely criticisms which I should like to discuss with you and Monsieur <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> beforehand.<note n="4" xml:id="d273fn4">For a report of that discussion, see <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 279, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</note> I have it in mind to confine discussion to the Chinese message and the commission’s report. If I cannot persuade Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> that discussion of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>’s message should be deferred until all Members of the Conference have commented, I shall make use of such comment as I have received and point out for myself that the Chinese are wrong in suggesting that the Geneva Agreements require a consultative conference. Only “consultations” are specified and these can as well take place by exchange of messages as across a table. I might suggest that the Vietminh should respond to the recent Vietnamese message which reaffirmed their adherence to the principle of unification by elections, provided the elections are genuinely free and democratic;<note n="5" xml:id="d273fn5">The reference apparently is to a letter from South Vietnamese Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Vu Van Mau</persName>, October 7, to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> in which <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Mau</persName> reiterated the Republic of Vietnam position on consultations and elections as stated in its declarations of July 16 and August 9. (Telegram 1564, October 6; Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/10–655; see also Cameron, <hi rend="italic">Viet Nam Crisis</hi>, vol. I, p. 415, footnote 8)</note> let the Vietminh now put forward concrete proposals to this end. As the Chinese message says, the object of the consultations specified by the Geneva Agreements is to reach agreement on this point.</p>
<p>On the Fourth Interim Report I should like to take the initiative, in the hope that my anodyne proposals may forestall—as in the case of the Vietminh message of August 17—Soviet pressure for more drastic and embarrassing action. For this purpose I would propose to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> that the two of us, as Co-Chairmen, should transmit the enclosed message to Members of the Geneva Conference and to <pb xml:id="pg_578" n="578" facs="0608"/>the three Supervisory Powers.<note n="6" xml:id="d273fn6">This proposed reply was attached to a copy of the <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> letter to <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> in Department of State, <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>/<gloss>SEA</gloss> Files: Lot 58 D 266, Vietnam—Geneva, Nov. 1955. In it the Geneva cochairmen “noted with concern” the references in the Fourth Interim Report of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> to inadequate cooperation received from authorities in both zones and expressed the hope that the authorities in the north and south would take steps to ensure full cooperation with the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> in the future.</note> I do not know whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> will let me get away with this, but, if he does, it may help with the Indian Government and British public opinion.</p>
<p>Of course, if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> presses me too hard on Vietnam, I shall tackle him on Laos and point out that his friends are even more in the wrong there than ours in Vietnam.</p>
<p>If there is anything in this that you do not agree with or if you can suggest anything else I might say to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>, I hope you will let me have your views as soon as possible.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Conversation with President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> on Village Defense Units</item>
</list>
<p>Enclosed for the information of the Department is a memorandum of conversation between President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName>, and myself on the subject of village auto-defense units, sometimes referred to as rural militia. The development of a system of village auto-defense units, averaging 10 men each for an estimated 6,000 villages, has been much on the minds of high Vietnamese Government officials in the past few months. Embassy telegram 1497, dated September 30,<note n="2" xml:id="d276fn2">Not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/9–3055)</note> reported President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s previous expression of interest in this subject. The recent regrouping of Vietnamese Army units into new divisional organizations, which has given Viet Minh cadres in many sections of the country greater freedom to commit acts of terrorism, has added an extra note of urgency to this problem.</p>
<p>During the past week, [name and title deleted] expounded on the village defense plan at some length to the joint Defense–<gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> costing team now in Saigon, headed by Major General William Lawton. In addition to repeating the arguments made by President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> as reported in the enclosed memorandum of conversation, [name deleted] emphasized the great advantage of having village security protected by local villagers who would be on call twenty four hours a day, and who were thoroughly familiar with local conditions and therefore more likely to be able to detect Viet Minh and dissident sect elements than either the Army or the Garde Civile, [name deleted] also made much of the relative cheapness of this form of protection, pointing out that the members of the rural militia required neither uniforms nor housing and would be paid only 300 piasters a month by the government, plus a rice ration contributed by the village.</p>
<p>The Embassy expects to receive shortly from the Vietnamese Government a written proposal outlining the organization of a village defense corps and asking for US financial support.<note n="3" xml:id="d276fn3">In telegram 2254 from Saigon, November 26, the Embassy reported that it had received such a proposal and was considering a response.

<p>When <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> and I called on President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> the evening of November 7 to discuss US approval of a 150,000 man force level for the Vietnamese Armed Forces, the President took the occasion to make a strong and lengthy plea for US financial support for the immediate development of a system of village auto-defense units. He expounded on the subject for over an hour. His thesis was the urgent need for the development of an adequate defense against continued Viet Minh terrorism and sabotage at the village level in numerous provincial areas of the country. Although this requirement for village defense was one of long standing, as attested by the Ministry of Defense’s study on the subject last March, two recent developments which had rendered the situation critical were the regrouping of <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> units into the new divisional organization and the imminence of elections for a National Assembly. Some of his associates were now insisting that if such a system were not organized shortly, it would not be possible to hold the elections as planned. In reply to my query whether the village defense system had not already been inaugurated in various areas, he admitted it had, but insisted that it was a makeshift effort and was being done in part with funds which the Governors had diverted from their proper use and in part on credit. Even this limited undertaking could not go on for more than a month or two on such a basis. His plan was for village defense units averaging ten men each for an estimated 6,000 villages. The men would be paid 500 piasters by the National Government, and their rice would be provided by the individual village. At a later stage in his presentation, the President said that if US financial support were only to the amount of 300 piasters per man, it would still be possible for him to establish the desired organization.</p>
<p>The President said that, in general, the Viet Minh retained a considerable capacity for terrorism and sabotage throughout the country. They were, however, unwilling to reveal the exact magnitude of their capability at this time. They were limiting their terroristic acts to methodical isolated forays calculated to terrorize the villages and to disrupt administrative and economic progress in the countryside. Until recently, the wide deployment of <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> battalions <pb xml:id="pg_583" n="583" facs="0613"/>had kept this activity down to a minimum, but the current withdrawal of these units for regrouping into divisional organizations had left many areas uncovered. Both civil and military officials were pressing him for something to fill the gap, and many unit commanders were reluctant for this reason to withdraw their forces from areas occupied at present. He cited as an example of this problem a recent raid carried out by Viet Minh forces during which they burned fifty-seven houses in a village near Long Xuyen the day following the withdrawal of the <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> battalion which had been stationed in the vicinity. The President said that in some areas this methodical Viet Minh action took the form of assassinating one or two notables of a village. This was an effective way of terrorizing their surviving colleagues on the village council.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName> asked whether the territorial battalions were being fully utilized to replace the battalions being moved into the new divisional organizations. The President said they were, and that the civil guard was being used to the maximum. The problem, he said, in its simplest terms, was that the resources available were not adequate to meet the total security requirements.</p>
<p>He mentioned as areas particularly troublesome those which have long been recognized as most subject to Viet Minh influence, namely: the plateau area north of Kontum, the mountains behind Quang Ngai from which a raid had been made against the city by some one hundred armed men at the time of the referendum; the whole area between Baria and Phan Thiet, which he said the French had never been able to occupy nor had his government to date; the Plaine des Joncs where there was collaboration between <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName>’s Hoa Hao remnants and Viet Minh; and finally, the Ca Mau Peninsula. In the course of the foregoing exposé, he mentioned incidentally that there was some evidence that certain Binh Xuyen remnants had succeeded in crossing from Phan Thiet to the Plaine des Joncs where they had joined up with the Hoa Hao and Viet Minh elements operating there. He also mentioned that in their joint operations with sect remnants the Viet Minh had so far used the sects as a cover and had not revealed their own true identity in those exercises.</p>
<p>When asked by <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> why it was not possible to organize village defense units without putting them on the government payroll, the President said that the economic level of the villages as a result of the many years of war was still too low for the villages to support the expense, and that it was necessary to provide a strong nucleus around which to build morale and the will to self-defense in the villages. He agreed with <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName>’ observation that this could only be achieved if the units were properly trained and controlled. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> went on to say that, traditionally, the villages had had a voluntary police system in which the able bodied men of a village <pb xml:id="pg_584" n="584" facs="0614"/>took their turn at serving as night watchmen. This was before the war when there were no firearms in the hands of the people, and the night watchman, who himself was unarmed, had nothing worse to contend with than an occasional sneak thief against whom he could arouse the whole village. During the Indochinese War, on the other hand, a system of auto-defense units in Vietnam had been supported by the French administration. Since they were made up of local personnel who knew the community in which they lived, they had been, in fact, a more effective anti-Communist instrument than the army itself. Unfortunately, these units had been dissolved after Geneva.</p>
<p>I told the President and [title deleted] who was present at the meeting that if they would submit to us a written proposal for US financial support for this project, it would be given the most immediate and sympathetic attention.</p>

</list>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion</p>
<p>1. I believe the United States Government should now shift from a short-term crash basis to a more long-range planning, and development where feasible in Cambodia, Laos and Viet-Nam. Internal developments in each of the Associated States have reached the point <pb xml:id="pg_585" n="585" facs="0615"/>where some long-term planning may be conceivable on political, economic, military, and informational programs. This would apply to all U.S. agencies operating in these countries. U.S. programs in Cambodia, Laos and Viet-Nam arose during the war with the Viet Minh, and we were not permitted by circumstances to do much more than fill urgent needs by the best means we had. The impetus of wartime programming has resulted in a continuation to a large extent of these past practices. Since the Geneva agreements of 1954 we have been operating on an emergency short-term basis. The Special <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> Committee on these three countries has favorably discussed this proposal in general.<note n="2" xml:id="d277fn2">See <ref target="#d272">Document 272</ref>.</note></p>
<p>2. In our long-range planning in Viet-Nam what should be the political targets in terms of political parties and political movements? Should we consider an economic program including investment in capital goods over a two or three year period for Viet-Nam? In Cambodia what should be our thinking on the long-term security and economic development? In Laos, should we gear our plans to recapturing the control of the two provinces through any means including military, or should we gear our plans to holding on to the ten provinces we have? In all three countries what size military and police forces should we plan for after June 1956? In the over-all picture to what extent should we associate Viet-Nam, Cambodia, and Laos with the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> organization and regional economic, political and military plans?</p>
<p>3. Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> is worried over the size and impact of our aid program. In his letter of September 20 to you,<note n="3" xml:id="d277fn3">A copy of <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>’s letter was attached to a memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_MDM1">MacDonald</persName> of <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> to <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName>, December 3. In it, <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> observed that none of the posts in Southeast Asia had had financial audits for several years, pointed out that it might not be an overstatement to say that aid was being forced on Southeast Asian countries, noted that pay level and allowances for local armies supported in whole or part by U.S. aid was “astonishingly high”, and questioned whether many underdeveloped countries in the area were able to absorb requested or appropriated U.S. aid funds. (Washington National Records Center, <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> Director’s Files: <gloss target="#t_FRC1">FRC</gloss> 61 A 32, Box 313, Vietnam)</note> the Senator expressed the opinion that the operation of the aid program warrants careful study, and that there are elements in the current operation of the program which inhibit its effectiveness in serving the foreign policy of the United States. A reply to this letter is being sent,<note n="4" xml:id="d277fn4"><p>This reply had actually been sent on November 17, signed by <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> as Acting Secretary. In it the Department admitted that audit procedures had been deficient and stated that improvements were being actively undertaken. The reply agreed also that it was pointless to force aid upon countries which did not want it, but, citing Cambodia as a possible example, stated that in some cases it had been necessary to endeavor to induce the government concerned to take steps to improve its competence to deal with a Communist threat to its security before it was too late.</p>
<p>Regarding Vietnam, the Department acknowledged “questions as to the type of program. The Vietnamese, as you know, have wished to increase the amount of dollar aid for capital investment. They place less emphasis on the need for imports of local currency producing consumer goods than the situation seems to require. So far as I have been able to ascertain, since the maintenance of the contemplated armed forces of Viet-Nam will continue to require large amounts of local currency assistance, acceding to the desires of Viet-Nam on this question would result in a still larger and more expensive program than we have been willing to provide.”</p>
<p>Concerning troop pay, the latter stated that the level of pay among U.S.-supported countries was high for the area, but pointed out that total military costs in Vietnam had recently been reduced from $2,000 to $1,500 per man year.</p>
<p>The Department agreed that many countries had limited capacity to absorb aid funds. A $40 million aid program to Laos could only be justified “as being one part of an effort to ensure that so strategic an area, vital to the defense of Burma, Thailand, Cambodia and Viet-Nam, does not fall into enemy hands.” (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_FESEA1">FE/SEA</gloss> Files: Lot 58 D 207, Vietnam: Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>)</p></note> including <pb xml:id="pg_586" n="586" facs="0616"/>some of the procedural points included in the attached memo.</p>
<p>4. There is also the question of sending a <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Bell</persName>-type special mission<note n="5" xml:id="d277fn5">In June 1950, the United States at the request of the Philippine Government sent an Economic Survey Mission, headed by Daniel W. Bell, then President of American Security and Trust Company and former Under Secretary of the Treasury, to the Philippines. The task of the <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Bell</persName> Mission was to survey the Philippine economy, to make recommendations to remedy the immediate deterioration of the economic situation, and to formulate long-range plans for future economic viability and progress. For documentation on the work of the mission, see <ref target="frus1950v06"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1950, vol. VI</ref>, pp. 1467 ff.</note> to Viet-Nam as recommended by Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> in his report.<note n="6" xml:id="d277fn6">See <ref target="#d263fn2">footnote 2, Document 263</ref>.</note> Aside from the fact that this is a recommendation of one of the most influential and knowledgeable Senators with respect to Viet-Nam, I believe there would be considerable merit in sending such a mission to Viet-Nam, provided the personnel were carefully selected and the terms of reference well thought out. Prior to the sending of such a mission, we in the United States Government should have a clearer idea of the scope of the proposed study of the mission. This mission could take the time to work with the operational people in <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> Saigon, who are doing a splendid job, in order to come up with some well-thought-out recommendations. Many of us are so tied down in Saigon and Washington in day to day operations that we cannot do this kind of job. Also, recommendations of this type of mission would carry greater political weight and tend to galvanize both the United States and Vietnamese Governments into more effective action.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendations</p>
<p>1. That you discuss the above informally with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> prior to further informal <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> discussions.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_587" n="587" facs="0617"/>
<p>2. That the State Department approve the sending of a <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Bell</persName>-type special economic mission to Viet-Nam, subject to the provisos mentioned above.</p>
<p>3. That after discussions between you and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName>, consideration be given to directing the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> Special Working Group on the Associated States to: (a) prepare a report and recommendations on long-range planning for the Associated States, and (b) draft terms of reference for the U.S. special mission.</p>
<p>4. That this problem also should be considered by the Interagency Committee (Assistant Secretary level) for coordinating military and economic aid.<note n="7" xml:id="d277fn7">The source text contains no indication of approval, but on December 8 <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> sent <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> a letter recommending, inter alia, long-range planning in Indochina by the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> and sending a <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Bell</persName>-type mission to Vietnam. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.5–MSP/12–855) On January 20, 1956, <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> responded agreeing that long-term planning and development was advisable but that consideration of a <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Bell</persName>-type mission should be postponed given the fact that there was already a 16-man <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> Technical Assistance Mission in Vietnam, that <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> was already reevaluating programs in Vietnam, and that the Government of Vietnam, at the urging of the Embassy and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>, had embarked on a program of agrarian reform.

<p>The high cost system for our military aid programs is a heritage from the days when the French hired locals in Viet-Nam for service in the French Army, and then allowed the Vietnamese to constitute an army at the same rate of pay as these Vietnamese serving in the French Army. The system could not be changed suddenly, without serious damage to the morale of the Vietnamese Army. The probable eventual answer is universal conscription, but the Government of Viet-Nam does not now have the power to institute conscription. An interagency team is shortly going to Saigon to study the costs of the Vietnamese forces, and possible means of reducing our contribution thereto.</p>
<p>The Vietnamese have requested that the aid program include more capital goods for economic development, and less consumer goods. This request by the Vietnamese may arise from a misunderstanding of the program, or may be an indirect method of requesting more aid from the United States. A large part of our aid program has as its principal purpose the generation of local currency to pay the <pb xml:id="pg_588" n="588" facs="0618"/>local currency costs of the military, and therefore of necessity must be the type of goods which will sell in Viet-Nam for piastres. In view of the current situation in Viet-Nam, the market demand is for consumer goods, not capital goods, since no one is willing to invest. If Government investment is carried out, this increases the cost of our aid program, for an alternative, the Government could have used these funds to meet part of the cost of the Vietnamese Army. However, it may be time to shift to a program aimed at increased economic development. To the extent that military costs could be reduced, the overall level of our aid program in Viet-Nam might not increase, or might even decline, but there would not be the large reduction that could otherwise be hoped for.</p>
<p>The restudy of our aid program should include a re-examination of aid program commercial import procedures. Much criticism by the Vietnamese and others arises from misunderstanding or an unfamiliarity with such procedures. It is recognized also that the procurement authorization procedure is a means of insuring purchases in the United States using proceeds from our aid programs. However, there is a strong possibility that the procurement authorization procedure may no longer be applicable or necessary for our aid programs in Viet-Nam, or elsewhere. It is time-consuming, the red-tape and paper work involved is intensely disliked by the business and banking community. In some cases, importing under the <gloss target="#t_PA1">PA</gloss> system requires several times as long as ordinary imports.</p>
<p>The procurement authorization procedure is wasteful. Each amendment to a <gloss target="#t_PA1">PA</gloss> requires exchange of correspondence, by cable usually, and much added paper work. More important, dollars are committed long in advance of the receipt of the needed local currency, giving rise to inflated aid pipelines. In some cases, pipelines are necessary, but the larger the pipeline the more waste and inefficiency in handling, since there is a general tendency to make sure that the pipeline is large enough to disgorge sufficient to the largely undetermined needs at some date in the future. There is nothing to overcome this tendency in a pipeline system which converts dollars into goods to be converted into piastres.</p>
<p>We should not allow the otherwise beneficial effects of our aid programs to be dissipated through inapplicable and antiquated procedures. Procedures can probably be worked out to give more protection against wastage of funds than the present <gloss target="#t_PA1">PA</gloss> procedure, without some of the defects of that procedure. If this is impossible, it may be necessary to request of Congress more flexible procedures for these three countries, either in the form of legislative history or request aid for these countries as a special title of the appropriation act not subject to the same procedural requirements as ordinary aid programs.</p>

<p>The <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> referendum of October 23, 1955 has been the subject of various previous Embassy reports.<note n="2" xml:id="d278fn2">The early stages of the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government’s press campaign against <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> leading up to the referendum were described in <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> sent Dept. 1518 dated October 2 and Despatch 123 dated October 18.

<p rend="sectiontitleital">Government Preparations for the Referendum</p>
<p>The Ministries of Interior and Information played the major roles in preparing the people of Free Vietnam for the referendum. A referendum committee led by representatives of these two ministries and including a number of political groups took charge of all information and propaganda activities. The political groups on the committee included such government parties as the Association of Functionaries of the National Revolution, the National Revolutionary Movement, the Association for National Restoration (Cao Daist) and the Movement of Struggle for Freedom. The committee carried on the following activities: 1) sent cadres to virtually every house in Saigon, Cholon and all other principal cities on October 16, 22, and 23 to urge the people to be sure to vote and, of course, to vote for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>; 2) organized meetings in villages and remote country areas to explain the referendum to the people; 3) sent radio cars and film production teams to various village areas to show films on election procedures, 4) sent mobile voting groups to remote areas and hospitals on election day; 5) made provisions to change railway time tables where necessary on October 23 to give travelers time to vote.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_590" n="590" facs="0620"/>
<p>A most intensive propaganda and educational campaign was carried on in Saigon and other cities with the double objective of whipping up hatred of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and of urging all citizens to vote. The government radio devoted hours of broadcasts daily to the referendum; radio cars roamed the streets broadcasting <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> propaganda and exhortations to vote; millions of leaflets, pamphlets, posters and banderoles covered walls, buildings, taxis, and buses; dummies of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> hung on practically every street corner and public square. The most popular dummy caricatured <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> carrying a bag of money on his shoulders, a pack of cards in his hands and pictures of naked women in his pockets. In the square before the central market in the heart of Saigon an enormous twenty foot high dummy of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> was put up depicting him in his yellow royal robes, carrying money bags and playing cards in one hand, a broken dragon scepter in the other, a woman on his knees. Behind him was a Vietnamese, representing the common people, breaking <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s throne with a long pole.</p>
<p>The posters and leaflets which covered all the population centers in Free Vietnam were of two kinds—those intended to show the people how to vote and those intended to inflame them against <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. An excellently done poster which described in easily understood cartoons each step in the voting procedure was the best example of the first type. The number and variety of anti-<persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> and pro-<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> leaflets and posters was virtually limitless. A random sampling of the slogans they contained follows: 1) Beware of the evil king <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>’s preference for gambling, women, wine, milk and butter. Those who vote for him betray their country. 2) <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, puppet king selling his country. 3) To depose <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> is to save Vietnam. 4) <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, master keeper of gambling dens and brothels. 5) <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, head traitor. 6) Drawings of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> offering a map of Vietnam to colonialists in return for millions of piasters; of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> receiving money from Binh Xuyen; of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> embracing French women; of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> on a leash held by a Frenchman; of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> with his foot on the neck of a Vietnamese. 7) Revolutionary <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName>, hero of the people. 8) <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName>, savior of the people. 9) Let us vote for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to build a democratic society. 10) <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName>, father of all children. 11) Not to go to the polls is a crime toward the fatherland.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Conduct of the Referendum</p>
<p>The conduct of the referendum was observed by Embassy, <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>, and USIS officials in various parts of the country. Their reports unanimously agreed that the referendum was conducted in compliance with the procedures laid down in the government proclamation outlining the method of voting. This was also the view expressed by representatives of the British, French, and Australian missions <pb xml:id="pg_591" n="591" facs="0621"/>in Saigon. The secrecy of the ballot was everywhere respected, and no evidence was found of fraud or direct intimidation. The usual procedure was for the voter to present his census registration card as proof of eligibility to vote, pick up a ballot and envelope, enter a curtained voting booth, place the closed envelope in the ballot box and finally have his registration card stamped to show that he had voted.</p>
<p>Some sidelights in connection with the voting may be of interest:</p>
<list>
<item>1) Groups of students went from house to house in Saigon early in the morning of October 23 reminding people to vote.</item>
<item>2) There were large crowds at all the polling booths when they opened at 7:00 a.m. By 9:00 a.m. most of the booths in Saigon, unprepared for the early rush, had temporarily run out of ballots. Two-thirds of the vote was in by 10:00 a.m., although the polls did not close until 5:00 p.m. The great majority of polling places were efficiently organized and voting was expeditiously carried out. In some instances, however, one narrow door served as both entrance and exit. In these cases, to avoid the crush many voters climbed out of windows after depositing their ballots.</item>
<item>3) Ballots contained pictures of both <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>, with a dotted line between them to facilitate separation by the voters. At many booths, those in charge of the voting separated the pictures in advance and handed both pictures to the voters along with an envelope. This was theoretically done to speed up the voting. However, it was noted that care was taken in every instance to see to it that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s picture was on top when the voters received the two pictures.</item>
<item>4) No mention was made in the voting regulations about absentee voting. Some polling places insisted on the physical presence of every voter, while others permitted one individual to vote for others as long as he was able to present their census registration cards as proof of eligibility.</item>
<item>5) After placing the picture of one candidate in the envelope, nearly all the voters simply dropped the other picture on the floor. The floors of polling places soon grew inches thick with discarded <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> pictures, with no <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> pictures to be seen. This sight undoubtedly had its psychological effect on any undecided voters. No attempts were made by officials, however, to observe what picture the voter discarded or whether he discarded any at all.</item>
<item>6) As each voter deposited his ballot, a badge was pinned on his shoulder carrying the legend “I have done my duty as a citizen” as a reminder to those who had not yet voted.</item>
</list>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Significance of the Result</p>
<p>The official result of the referendum was announced by Minister of the Interior Bui Van Thinh in a statement made at Saigon City Hall on the morning of October 26. The final voting figures were: <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>—5,721,735 (98.2%); <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>—63,017 (1.1%); invalid—44,155 (.7%); number of eligible voters not participating—131,395 (2.2%). Bui Van Thinh’s statement announcing the result is attached as Enclosure <pb xml:id="pg_592" n="592" facs="0622"/>1 to this despatch.<note n="3" xml:id="d278fn3">Not printed.</note> The text of the speech made by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> at Saigon City Hall acknowledging the result of the referendum and proclaiming the state of Vietnam to be a republic is attached as Enclosure 2.<note n="4" xml:id="d278fn4">This speech, delivered October 26, is not printed.</note></p>
<p>The result of the referendum is difficult to assess with any degree of confidence because of the questions raised in the minds of impartial observers by the overwhelming vote for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and especially by the enormous percentage (97.8%) voting of those eligible. A sweeping <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> victory was anticipated, but that virtually every citizen south of the 17th parallel would vote for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was not anticipated. Given the high rate of illiteracy, the hundreds of tiny villages without communication facilities and the inevitable factors of ignorance, apathy, and illness, it is difficult to believe that nearly 98% of the eligible population actually cast votes. Other factors working against a virtually unanimous turnout were the instructions issued by various anti-government sect leaders telling their members to abstain from participation in the referendum and the presumed efforts of Vietminh cadres in the South—in line with communist broadcasts from Hanoi—to persuade villagers under their influence to abstain from voting.</p>
<p>A further element of uncertainty is the fact that statistics in Vietnam are notoriously unreliable. The figures of the recent census, which determined the total number of eligible voters, may themselves be questioned in light of the lack of security prevailing in some areas during the census, the feebleness or lack of Government authority in other regions, and the limited machinery available to the Government in carrying out the census.</p>
<p>However, it is by no means impossible that the results announced by the government were approximately correct. The electoral campaign was completely one-sided. No support for <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> or opposition to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was permitted, while the government carried out a most intensive and efficient propaganda campaign for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and against <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. There was a genuine upsurge of national pride at this first opportunity to express the people’s will at the polls, accompanied by a desire on the part of the individual citizen to play a personal role on a historical occasion by casting his ballot. Also helping to swell the vote totals was the widespread fear that failure to vote might mean future difficulties—that an individual who could not produce a registration card stamped to show that he had voted in the referendum might be singled out by the government at some future time for reprisals. All of these factors undoubtedly helped to contribute to the enormous turnout of voters.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_593" n="593" facs="0623"/>
<p>Anti-<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> nationalist elements, whose most vocal spokesman is the clandestine Dai Viet Radio, refused to credit the official referendum results announced by the government. The Dai Viet radio made the following allegations of fraud: 1) The government had the ballots printed in different colors—red for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, blue for <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName><note n="5" xml:id="d278fn5">Actually the <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> half of the ballot was <hi rend="italic">green</hi>. [Footnote in the source text.]</note>—so that its agents could easily spot a discarded <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> ballot. This tended to intimidate those who might have voted for <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName>. 2) The vote counters, who were supposed to be picked at random from the crowd, were all <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> agents who were chosen by prearranged signals. These agents manipulated the voting results as they pleased. 3) Police and security agents received instructions to vote one hundred times each. All of these allegations are unsupported by evidence. Despite a widespread feeling of skepticism among foreign observers about the near unanimity of the vote, no solid evidence has yet turned up to substantiate charges of fraud.</p>
<p>On the assumption that the announced voting figures are reasonably accurate, they seem to call for a revision of heretofore accepted estimates of the political strength of the Vietminh in South Vietnam. It might be argued that the Vietminh deliberately refrained from attempting either to interfere with the conduct of the referendum or to reduce the margin of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s victory on the ground that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s triumph was a foregone conclusion. It seems more logical to assume, however, that the Vietminh cadres in the South would have wished to weaken and discredit <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. Reports that the Vietminh campaigned for <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> have not been substantiated, but it is known that the Vietminh radio in Hanoi repeatedly urged the populace in the South to abstain from voting, and it may be assumed that the Vietminh cadres in the South bent their efforts in that direction. In this they failed utterly, and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> emerged from the referendum with enhanced prestige and a solid vote upon which he could base his claim for backing in carrying out his uncompromising anti-communist policies and his domestic program. Another result of the referendum was to bury <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> so completely under a landslide of votes that it is difficult to see how either his remaining handful of supporters or the Vietminh could or would want to use him as a basis for anti-<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> moves in the future.</p>
<p>It should not be assumed, however, that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s overwhelming victory over <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> is a true measure of his popularity in Vietnam. It must be remembered that the referendum was in one sense a travesty on democratic procedures, since the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> forces maintained absolute control over all avenues of propaganda and did not permit the opposition to make its case. Furthermore, the referendum questions were so designed that in order to depose <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> it was necessary to <pb xml:id="pg_594" n="594" facs="0624"/>vote affirmatively for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. Voters who wished to depose <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao Dai</persName> without voting for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had no way of registering such a vote.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen, therefore, how a <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>-backed slate of candidates will fare in a truly democratic election, in which the opposition is free to oppose and the voters are free to vote for whomever they please. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has repeatedly said that he wishes to hold such an election, and it may be assumed that his resounding triumph in the referendum will add strength to his desire. As the first president of the Republic of Vietnam, he is now more firmly in the saddle than ever before.</p>

<p>1. Following is summary of Vietnamese Government proposal for Self-Defense Corps for which United States financial assistance was recently asked (see reference telegram).</p>
<list>
<item>a. It is essential for government to engage in decisive action against infiltration and subversive tactics of Communists particularly in rural and outlying areas. To have best effects, such action must be carried out at village level and must be both military (armed police) and political.</item>
<item>b. In addition to mobile security organizations (army, Garde Civile), it is necessary to create a fixed organization in each village to serve as base for anti-Communist activities. Self-Defense Corps (Dan-Ve-Doan) meets this need. It has advantage of being composed of local inhabitants, thoroughly familiar with village conditions, who will be on call to police and defend village 24 hours a day. In addition to serving as police force defending against bandit attacks or subversive activities, Self-Defense Corps will serve as political cadre to give needed assistance to villagers and to organize anti-Communist activities among population.</item>
<item>c. Each village to have Corps composed of 10 militiamen, plus chief and assistant chief. Militiamen to receive from National Government 300 piastres a month, assistant chief 500, chief 600, plus certain allowances from village. Total monthly expenditure per village 4100 piastres. Self-Defense Corps for estimated 6000 villages and 1000 village groups would cost 344,400,000 piastres annually for salaries, plus 50 million piastres for weapons and equipment, for total of 400 million piastres. Weapons to be provided include firearms, swords, daggers and hand grenades. (<hi rend="italic">End summary</hi>)</item>
</list>
<p>2. Country team has approved temporary financial support for Self-Defense Corps with mission to protect local communities from intimidation and indoctrination by Vietminh, rebels and bandits threatening local security. Mission of Self-Defense Corps does not necessarily include pacification, as Corps will be established only in villages already cleared of dissident elements. Corps will conduct guard and police patrol duties, promote organized anti-Communist activities in villages, take direct action against perpetrators of civil disturbances, and report regularly through established channel of command on all activities in and around villages.</p>
<p>3. Corps to be activated in each village by military commander of region. All corpsmen to be carefully screened for loyalty, reliability <pb xml:id="pg_597" n="597" facs="0627"/>and aptitude, fingerprinted and photographed before being issued weapons or placed on payroll. Training programs to be instituted in each province.</p>
<p>4. We envisage support of Self-Defense Corps as emergency measure only, and plan to make clear to Vietnamese Government that we do not intend to give long-range support to this type of program. It is our belief that until pacification of country is completed and Vietminh influence in villages substantially eliminated, government supported village defense units are necessary. As government authority is strengthened and country becomes more viable economically, we anticipate Garde Civile will become increasingly more able to fulfill its intended function of maintaining law and order through Vietnam and that villages themselves will be able to provide whatever additional protection needed.</p>
<p>5. With country team approval, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> has included in Vietnamese military budget for <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1956 appropriation of $6,170,400 for payment of 300 piastres monthly to 60,000 members of Self-Defense Corps, averaging 10 men each for 6,000 villages. (This was size of organization originally proposed by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. Current Vietnam proposal for 12 men each for 7,000 villages represents very recent afterthought.) United States financial support runs from January 1, 1956–December 31, 1956. Arms and ammunition to be supplied from non-United States weapons now on hand in Vietnam.</p>
<p>6. Costing team headed by Major <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Lawton</persName>, USA, which just left Saigon for United States has accepted above amount (paragraph 5) for inclusion in <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> budget estimate they will discuss in Washington. We would appreciate earliest possible approval this project.<note n="3" xml:id="d280fn3">In telegram 2420 from Saigon, December 8, the Embassy submitted as an additional reason for early approval of U.S. financial support for village defense corps recent intelligence reports of increased capabilities for Viet Minh infiltration, sabotage, and terrorism at the village level.

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Raising U.S. military personnel ceiling for <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Vietnam.</item>
</list>
<p>1. Military personnel restrictions for <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Vietnam have become an increasingly serious handicap to the attainment of U.S. objectives in Vietnam. Currently, the United States is limited to a ceiling of 342 military personnel for <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Vietnam. This figure resulted from the State Department’s interpretation of Chapter III, Article 16, of the Geneva Agreement of 20 July 1954 to mean that the United States is prohibited from introducing military personnel in excess of the 342 U.S. military personnel actually present in Vietnam on 23 July 1954.</p>
<p>2. The number of 342 military personnel has never been considered adequate by Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, Vietnam or <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> to meet the tasks of the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>. Requests by the Secretary of Defense to the Secretary of State for a more liberal interpretation of personnel ceiling limitations to exclude certain temporary additional training teams, communication personnel and other military personnel not performing <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> functions, have been denied and the Secretary of State has reaffirmed that the limitation of 342 U.S. military personnel in Vietnam must be rigidly adhered to.</p>
<p>3. The <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Vietnam and the French forces have been working together in accomplishing the redistribution of United States furnished <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> material and in training Vietnamese forces. The progressive withdrawal by the French of their military personnel without replacement and the inability of the United States to augment the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> personnel has created a critical situation both in carrying out redistribution of <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> equipment and in the training of Vietnamese forces. <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> has recently reported on the gravity of this <pb xml:id="pg_599" n="599" facs="0629"/>situation. In respect to the redistribution of <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> equipment he states, “It is also foreseeable that present restrictive personnel policy could cause maintenance and redistribution losses of millions of dollars in U.S. Indochina war equipment.” In respect to the over-all accomplishment of U.S. objectives, he states, “We must now balance the mere possibility of criticism (with some technical basis which we can contradict with at least equally plausible contentions) by an enemy who will ‘inevitably criticize’ as loudly without any basis at all, against the grim actuality of an unacceptable shortage of key personnel necessary to keep <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_TRIM1">TRIM</gloss> programs operating effectively in a most critical period which may well determine whether South Vietnam will stand with us or fall to the Communists. I urge that our policy be re-examined on a realistic basis and made sufficiently flexible to meet our vital interests. A second failure in Indochina by the Free World will be exceedingly serious. Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and possibly Burma and Malaya may be at stake. Our effort to avert this disaster should not be made with our hands self-tied behind us because of fear of possible Communist propaganda.”</p>
<p>4. The Joint Chiefs of Staff concur in the views of <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>. They believe that it would be realistic to interpret the provisions of the Geneva Agreement to permit replacement of French military personnel, withdrawn from the Combined Training Organization (<gloss target="#t_TRIM1">TRIM</gloss>) without replacement, by US. military personnel. Similarly, it should be permissible to replace French military technicians, withdrawn without replacement from execution of the <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> equipment redistribution activities, by U.S. military technicians. Accordingly, it is recommended that the Secretary of Defense inform the National Security Council of the gravity of the situation in Vietnam, requesting authority to raise the 342 limitation on U.S. military personnel in Vietnam to replace, as required, French military personnel withdrawn without replacement from the training and <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> equipment redistribution programs.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 17. Bilateral with <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> on <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> December 17 discussion only in general terms covering following topics:</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Vietnam</p>
<p>(a) <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> began by describing difficulties particularly economic in French-Vietnamese relations. He said he still intended to visit Saigon but could not go until latter part of January because of elections and formation of new government. His mission would be to assure <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> France recognizes only Republic of Vietnam headed by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> also hopes to gain <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s confidence and persuade him improve relations with France. <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> hoped US could use its influence help bring this about. Secretary stressed importance <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> mission and urged desirability France and Vietnam rapidly reaching fundamental understanding which would permit basis for better relations.</p>
<p>(b) <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> stressed need for common French-US line toward Vietnam to prevent Vietnamese from playing French off against Americans and vice versa which he believes they are now doing. Secretary reiterated necessity for Franco-Vietnamese understanding and pointed out limitations of exercise of US influence on Vietnamese.</p>
<p>(c) In reply to Secretary’s question re <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sainteny</persName> mission, <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> replied French must have some officials in Hanoi to protect remaining French cultural and economic interests. However <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> assured Secretary that this did not constitute diplomatic or consular mission in Hanoi. Secretary pointed out <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and Vietnamese are extremely mistrustful of French relationships with Viet Minh. <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> fully acknowledged this and said one of his purposes in going to Saigon would be to convince <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> on need for some French official representation of a limited nature in the north without any political connotation and without prejudice French recognition Republic Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> then made curious suggestion he hoped also to persuade <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> he should have an observer in the north and that there might be some value in economic exchanges between north and south in terms of rice and coal. (Embassy will try find out what French mean and why.)</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_601" n="601" facs="0631"/>
<p>(d) <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> noted experts had already covered economic and financial subjects<note n="2" xml:id="d283fn2">Reports of these meetings are in telegrams 2886 and 2889 from Paris, December 16 and 17. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 851G.131/12–1655 and 651.51G/12–1755)</note> but he wished to stress great difficulties French are having because of Vietnamese denunciation of monetary accord and inability of French concerns repatriate profits and capital. He said <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> must understand necessity of respecting accords with France. He hoped US aid procedures could be made a little more flexible to help alleviate franc shortage. Secretary replied he did not wish to go into details which had already been fully discussed at working level. <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> replied so-called details could be block solution economic and financial problems. Secretary indicated we would look into question of flexibility with interested agencies in Washington but in light of discussions in Paris at expert level.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Laos</p>
<p>Secretary raised dangerous situation caused by Pathet Lao threat but <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> had no comment other than to agree. Secretary urged France strengthen training mission and base personnel since US forbidden by Geneva accord instruct Lao forces which must be improved in view of threat. No reaction from French side.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">3. <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss></p>
<p>Secretary stressed need strengthen <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> at March meeting. <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> agreed in principle. No details discussed.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Trade with Communist China</p>
<p>Secretary informed <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> US had protested British unilateral intention change list. Secretary said US not necessarily adverse to some liberalization but felt strongly any changes should result from consultation and common action. <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> completely agreed need common action since it would be most unfortunate if individual countries took unilateral action. He stated cohesion among western powers is becoming increasingly important and necessary.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">5. Security Council</p>
<p>Secretary informed <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> his agreement with <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> re proposal split tenure between Philippines and Yugoslavia. <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> doubted its legality.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">6. Press</p>
<p>Secretary pointed out <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> sensitivity and mistrust regarding bilateral talks on Vietnam. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> agreed not to mention to <pb xml:id="pg_602" n="602" facs="0632"/>press any discussion of Vietnam but to describe talks as general discussion common problems in South East Asia and Middle East.</p>
<p>Following meeting French Foreign Office officials said they would inform Vietnamese officials in Paris and Saigon gist of talk re Vietnam. We said we would probably do likewise. French thought desirable give Vietnamese authorities full account of discussion.</p>
<p>(<persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> did not raise Geneva accords or question consultations and all-Vietnam elections. He did refer briefly but inconclusively question military accords and <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>.)</p>

<p>1) On <hi rend="italic">28 December 1955</hi> <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> met with President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, at the request of the President to discuss matters of military import. The President had returned on 27 December 1955 from a trip to Hue and information he had received there had apparently prompted the meeting.</p>
<p>2) Present at the meeting were:</p>

<item>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName></item>
<item><persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Lt. Gen. Williams</persName></item>
<item>Colonel Finn</item>
<item>Lt. Col. Croizat, USMC (Interpreter)</item>
</list>
<p>3) After greetings, <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> read a message of holiday greetings that <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName> had sent to the President. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> gave the President a paper<note n="2" xml:id="d284fn2">Not found attached, but printed <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</note> he had prepared on guerrilla fighting and remarked that he hoped the President would read it carefully and that it would be of some assistance in forming plans to combat the Viet Minh.</p>
<p>4) President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> stated that he had several points of military interest to discuss as a result of his recent trip to Hue. The first point was that it was now apparent that the Viet Minh had failed to realize their political aims through propaganda and other means of indoctrination and were now employing open military action. The activities <pb xml:id="pg_603" n="603" facs="0633"/>in the Plaine des Joncs were mentioned as an example. The danger areas in Central Vietnam are Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and the 17th Parallel area. The Viet Minh have regrouped their cadres for concerted action in key areas.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> stated that he had spent all of Tuesday, 27 December 1955 being briefed in detail by <gloss target="#t_TRIM1">TRIM</gloss> Field Advisors and no one had mentioned such Viet Minh activity.</p>
<p>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said that such information does not normally come through military channels, but Viet Minh units have begun holding maneuvers in the mountain and other out of the way areas. To combat the Viet Minh, many localities of Central Vietnam have formed village guards. (The President referred to those units as Self-Defense Corps Units, Village Guards and Popular Forces.) The President mentioned that these units were being formed even though there was no money available as yet. The Self-Defense Corps units in the South would remain within the confines of the village but this is not possible in Central Vietnam because the villages are more widely separated. Units will be required to maneuver outside of villages and have already had a few skirmishes with the Viet Minh. The Viet Minh cadres moved into Quang Tri about three months ago and several prisoners have been taken. At first the prisoners would not talk but the good treatment they are receiving is beginning to have the intended effect and they are commencing to talk. They say that the Viet Minh depend more on their Popular Forces than on the Regular Army and that in case of an invasion of South Vietnam, the Popular Forces would be cast loose and with the cooperation of the already present fifth column would spread throughout Vietnam. Our own Popular Forces of the villages have had good success against the Viet Minh; much better than the Garde Civile (National Police) because they know the terrain and have more initiative. The Garde Civile is held back because of administrative red tape and cannot act quickly. I have had to advise the Garde Civile authorities in the South to exercise caution in their recruiting because they are getting men with various political leanings. The entire Garde Civile needs a strong political indoctrination.</p>
<p>5) The President described his visit to the troops west of Long Xuyen for Christmas. He spent one afternoon at Long Xuyen discussing the political party, “Movement of National Revolution.”</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> asked if the President had received word that <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> was available to accompany him on his trip.</p>
<p>[Apparent omission in the source text.]</p>
<p>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> replied that it definitely would support him, a few people got out of line now and then but any such tendencies were easily checked. The Army is glad to see this new party take charge of the Long Xuyen area and establish loyal control. The Secretary <pb xml:id="pg_604" n="604" facs="0634"/>of Interior does not have the full support of all the Province Chiefs and Police Chiefs. Some of them are actually Communists even though I have prohibited government leaders from joining specific political parties.</p>
<p>6) President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> stated that General <persName>Minh</persName> of the 1st Military Region was in the process of reviewing the military situation in the West. A good bit of news is that Hunh Fu Cho, the father of the Hoa Hao movement has rallied to the government. The situation is beginning to improve. The operations of the Viet Minh and dissident sects is [<hi rend="italic">are</hi>] now generally concentrated in the Plaine des Joncs and in Camau. The Viet Minh have reorganized the cadres in Camau and have picked up some rebels that have been split away from <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName>’s main force.</p>
<p>7) The President stated that to be successful against the Viet Minh you must use the same tactics they employ. There are a great number of ex-Viet Minh who have rallied to the government but the ceiling on the strength of the Army makes it impossible to integrate them. However, many have been placed in the Garde Civile and they will be very helpful in the Popular Forces. They are definitely the troops that should be used to fight the Viet Minh; as they know how best to fight them. There is another part to this problem and “I hope you can help me solve it.” General <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName> is against the ex-Viet Minh personally and his staff and commanders in most cases mimic him. Colonel Oai and Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NTP1">Phuong</persName> are two very capable officers who are ex-Viet Minh but no one will listen to them. Colonel Duc has defended them but rather weakly. In the South the local commanders, who are favorites of General <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Ty</persName>, do just what they want. The situation is better in Central Vietnam. I have directed that maximum use be made of the ex-Viet Minh officers but this order is obeyed with reluctance and in many cases the reluctance is almost sabotage. In general it would not be good to have the National Army coordinate the activities of the Popular Forces. In Central Vietnam there could be some collaboration between the Popular Forces and the Army if the Army Officers utilized were carefully selected. We should start Guerrilla Warfare of our own. The Army does not understand, as it sees only the classic military solution. A number of things will have to be changed; including the manner in which the Secretary of Interior<note n="3" xml:id="d284fn3">Bui Van Thinh was Minister of the Interior.</note> handles his responsibilities. The intellectuals of Vietnam view democracy with a French background and think that instead of cooperating with the government, they must oppose it and force it to grant these concessions.</p>
<p>8) The President stated that he had seen several plans for the defense of Vietnam and that the General Staff was in the process of <pb xml:id="pg_605" n="605" facs="0635"/>preparing a new one. But they are considering only Vietnam and not the overall situation that would include all of Indochina at least. Vietnam would only be a part of an overall plan. In view of <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>’s visit I am interested in what you think about a <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Defense Plan. Would it be a static defense plan or would the war be carried to Haiphong or some other place. The General Staff lacks sufficient information to prepare an accurate plan for Vietnam. We must know all of the external [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] that would influence the defense of our country.</p>
<p>9) <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> [said?] that he had been in Vietnam for two months and had learned a lot. I know most of the things of which you have spoken. Many of them are covered in the paper I gave you and if the suggestions in that paper are implemented, many of your problems will be solved. It was very difficult to obtain local approval of the Self-Defense Corps and I am awaiting approval from Washington. I consider the Self-Defense Corps to be necessary and you might ask <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> when an answer to our request can be expected. Also, I consider it proper for you to request strong support for your Garde Civile and to ask the <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral</persName> for information concerning what action <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> will take in case of aggression. As for the Army, I have repeatedly spoken of the danger of Officers having difficulties and jealousies among themselves. Such things will surely destroy the very thing you are trying to build. The <gloss target="#t_FAVN1">FAVN</gloss> General Staff must be made to move faster, think more quickly, and to plan ahead. I have found that, with the end of the year only three days away, the General Staff has not provided the paper targets for range firing; although the money is available. I have given up trying to get the targets through <gloss target="#t_FAVN1">FAVN</gloss> and have used my own money with which to purchase them. The Viet Minh will attack only when Moscow tells them to and that means international war which the Communists do not want. The real danger lies in the local Viet Minh cadres and they must be destroyed like vermin. The greatest trouble in the Army lies with the completely inadequate logistical system.</p>
<p>10) At this point the meeting came to a close as President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had another engagement. The possibility of a later meeting was discussed briefly but no definite date or time was established.</p>

<dateline><hi rend="italic"><placeName>Saigon</placeName>, <date when="1955-12-28">December 28, 1955</date></hi>.</dateline>
<p>There follow herewith certain remarks on the subject of “Guerrilla Operations”. I am sure you are familiar with these matters but some of your officers may not be.</p>
<p>1. Communist guerrillas can be destroyed if early, aggressive action is taken and relentless pressure if [<hi rend="italic">is</hi>] vigorously applied. The political, psychological, economic and military actions should all be coordinated for successful results.</p>
<p>2. All should remember that Communist guerrillas have been destroyed in Greece, Korea, the Philippines and Iran. They can be destroyed in Vietnam.</p>
<p>3. A guerrilla force, to survive, must enjoy the support of at least part of the civil population in which it operates. Further, it must have access to supplies from friendly bases of the sponsoring power or powers.</p>
<p>4. Communist guerrilla strategy is simple. By using a small amount of arms, equipment and food and a few good military leaders a new government is forced to utilize relatively large military forces to a campaign that is costly in time, money and men. The population is terrorized into passive inaction. They give to the people as their reason for their operations, revolt against Colonialism, opposition to a corrupt government, resistance to oppression, or any other reason they think the local inhabitants will believe.</p>
<p>5. In Korea in 1950 the South Koreans were using three (3) Divisions to fight less than 7000 guerrillas in the South East. When the North Koreans attack [<hi rend="italic">attacked</hi>] on 25 June of that year the South Korean Army suffered from this diversion as their Army was not strategically nor tactically deployed to meet the North Korean attack.</p>
<p>6. It is possible the Communist guerrillas are attempting the same tactics in Vietnam, i.e. pull large military forces into the South and West so that they will not be trained and be in proper position to fight against an invasion from the North. For this reason any regular Army troops sent into the area to combat guerrillas should complete their task with speed, then turn the area over to the Civil Guard and Village Defense Corps and move back into their tactical and strategic locations. Great speed in operations are [<hi rend="italic">is</hi>] necessary.</p>
<p>7. Communist guerrillas follow the teachings of Mao Tse-tung which can be stated briefly as follows:</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_607" n="607" facs="0637"/>
<list>
<item>a. Guerrillas recognize the superior strength of the enemy. Therefore they must avoid large battles, seek for local superiority, select objectives for attack that will assure success.</item>
<item>b. Adjust their operations to suit political requirements.</item>
<item>c. Wage a war of extermination, seize arms and expand their forces.</item>
<item>d. Fight a war of movement. Positional warfare to be avoided except to defend permanent guerrilla bases.</item>
<item>e. Retain the initiative in both attack and retreat and maintain great flexibility in massing, dispersing and shifting forces.</item>
<item>f. Gain local superiority by concentrating small groups into large groups for a particular battle.</item>
<item>g. Maintain close control of the civilian population and close coordination with Communist Party Workers in the area in regard to propaganda, agitation and give help to needy local people.</item>
</list>
<p>8. In Korea quick action by small guerrilla forces was employed, followed by rapid withdrawal, dispersal and subsequent reassembly and redeployment as a unit. These tactics were also used by the Confederate guerrilla during the “War between the States” in the United States in 1860–65 and by the American Indians against U.S. troops in 1870–80. Such tactics enable the guerrilla to attract large bodies of troops to their area. Troops that are needed elsewhere against a hostile Army.</p>
<p>9. Tactical operations by guerrillas in all countries include ambushes, raids on Army and police out-posts, small villages, hit and run terror raids, agitation and propaganda. They also attempt infiltration into Government Forces. The bulk of guerrilla incidents will be raids and ambushes. Ambushes of vehicles are usually laid at road bends or bridges. Small size friendly patrols will frequently be ambushed from hiding at close range. Patrols in column are particularly vulnerable on their flanks when cover is dense.</p>
<p>10. Raids against towns or villages are to loot for food, clothing, and money, and to terrorize the local population. They will usually occur at night. Withdrawal from these raids may be by a different route from the route of attack. Police boxes erected on approaches to towns are of little value for they can be avoided or surprised and destroyed by attacking guerrillas.</p>
<p>11. In Korea the following guerrilla operations were necessary.</p>
<list>
<item>Operation Rat Killer—Dec 51 to Mar 52—two Divisions</item>
<item>Operation Ferret—Mar 52 to Jun 52—one Division</item>
<item>Operation Mongoose—Jul 52—two Divisions</item>
<item>Operation Bloodhound—Aug 52 to Nov 53—one Division</item>
<item>Operation Trample—Dec 53 to Jun 54—two Divisions</item>
</list>
<p>12. It is believed that extermination of guerrillas in Korea could have been done in 1951 if the campaign had been pressed hard and relentlessly at the very start. Time is always in favor of the guerrillas.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_608" n="608" facs="0638"/>
<p>13. Military operations alone are not sufficient for success as there are really two objectives: the destruction of the guerrilla force and the elimination of the Communist influence on the civil population. An over-all plan at Government level embracing political, psychological, economic, administrative and military action is necessary for success.</p>
<p>14. Purely defensive measures will permit a guerrilla force to grow and become strong. Continuous, unrelenting pressure on the guerrilla must be maintained.</p>
<p>15. Government troops or police must not sit in camp waiting until they hear a guerrilla raid and then go to the attack. They must continue to sweep the area and screen the population and hunt down the guerrilla. In this way the Government forces maintain the offensive and do not allow the guerrilla to decide when and where the fight will be.</p>
<p>16. The major political and psychological mission is to win the active and willing support of the people and to deprive the guerrilla of that support. The old principle of reward and punishment is applicable. Reward those that help the Government, punish those that support the guerrillas. The attitude of Government officials, police and Army toward the people should be good. Harsh, unjust, arbitrary action or mass punishment of innocent people, for the misdeeds of a few, will drive more people into the guerrilla ranks.</p>
<p>17. The military campaign should be in harmony with the political, psychological and economic policies. Isolate the enemy from the people, break them into small groups. Cut them off from contact and supplies. In Vietnam it would be best to cut them away from the Cambodian border. This to prevent them from going into Cambodia to rest and recuperate and build up forces.</p>
<p>18. A good intelligence system is necessary so that information can come in with great speed. Money spent for this purpose will usually be well spent. Good personality files should be developed. Special effort should be made to kill the guerrilla leaders.</p>
<p>19. The guerrilla will have a good intelligence system also so great care must be taken to preserve secrecy of operational plans. If this is not done the guerrilla will escape before the trap is sprung. The Communist guerrilla will attempt to infiltrate Communist agents into the Government forces. All civilians that have access to the Military Headquarters should be checked by the military or the police or both. All operational plans should be closely guarded and never discussed in public.</p>
<p>20. Combat operations should follow this sequence:</p>
<p>The commander establishes his headquarters in or near the guerrilla area, moves his troops in, establishes bases of operation, takes proper security measures, obtains essential intelligence, prepares <pb xml:id="pg_609" n="609" facs="0639"/>operational plans and then launches his combat operations. Continuous pressure is maintained to seek out, gain contact with and utterly destroy the enemy.</p>
<p>21. At no time should be [<hi rend="italic">the</hi>] guerrillas be given opportunity to rest, reorganize, rehabilitate, recruit or prepare for future operations.</p>
<p>22. The operation is over when there are no guerrillas remaining—not when the guerrillas have merely been disorganized and dispersed.</p>
<p>23. Deception, speed, ruses, ingenuity, and aggressive leadership are needed for success.</p>
<p>24. If Government forces can’t surround the guerrilla area another maneuver is to drive across the area. This takes fewer troops. The guerrillas should be driven toward a blocking force which will destroy them as they seek to escape. The objective must always be the same—kill or capture the entire guerrilla force. Never allow any to escape.</p>
<p>25. “Special anti-guerrilla forces” can often have more success than “conventional” forces many times their size. The mobility of anti-guerrilla forces should be given priority over heavy fire support. Light mortars should be able to provide all the fire support needed for the riflemen and the automatic riflemen. Sometimes recoilless rifles or rockets are needed but they are heavy and slow down the troops.</p>
<p>26. Leadership, tactical ingenuity, perseverance in the face of repeated frustrations, professional skill, physical endurance and high morale under conditions of great hardship are needed in fighting guerrillas. The longer the guerrilla bands are allowed to exist, the more difficult the tasks become.</p>
<p>27. The unskilled, lazy commander will be ambushed, defeated and fail. Enough failures can place the Government in danger.</p>
<p>28. One may expect the guerrilla to attempt to cause friction between the police and the Army and between the police and Army on one side and the Government on the other. They will promote jealousy wherever they can. Whenever they see American Advisors with Vietnamese Units they will tell the population and the Vietnamese soldier that they are pawns of the Americans. Probably they have already done this.</p>
<p>29. In conclusion:</p>
<list>
<item>a. Communist guerrillas can be destroyed if fast, aggressive action is taken.</item>
<item>b. The plan should coordinate political, economic, psychological and military action.</item>
<item>c. Government forces should seize the initiative and apply relentless pressure. Never letting up.</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_610" n="610" facs="0640"/>
<item>d. Active cooperation of the civilian population is necessary if the Government is to succeed.</item>
<item>e. The guerrillas will not be defeated and destroyed until cut off from supply from their sponsoring power.</item>
<item>f. Adequate incentives to support the Government and oppose the guerrillas should be provided.</item>
<item>g. A good Government intelligence net is necessary.</item>
<item>h. Tactics should emphasize surprise, deception, speed of movement, thorough reconnaissance, aggressive fighting when contact is gained, vigorous pursuit. All this maintained until the enemy is utterly destroyed.</item>
<item>i. All commanders should know that to combat guerrillas and merely disperse them is like an operation for cancer that only takes out a small part of the growth.</item>
<item>j. The Communist guerrilla leader in Vietnam will consider himself successful as long as he can keep large numbers of Army troops away from their strategic and tactical locations and untrained for fighting against an invading army. In doing this the enemy is using a very few inexpensive troops to neutralize a large percent of the Vietnamese Armed Forces. In addition he is providing the thought to weak minded citizens throughout the entire land that the existing Government is weak and without strength.</item>

<p>From 1700 until 1915, Wednesday, 28 December 1955, I met with President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in the Presidential Palace in Saigon. Present at the meeting were Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">George F. Reinhardt</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Lt. General Samuel T. Williams</persName>, USA, Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, Maj. General Robert N. Cannon, Colonel Leroy H. Watson, Jr., and an interpreter. During most of this two and one quarter hour meeting, President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> talked steadily. Some of what he said was repetitious, so I will attempt to outline below only the main themes that were covered during this meeting.<note n="2" xml:id="d286fn2">One of the themes not covered by <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> was <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s mention of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. In his report of the same meeting, <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> stated in part: “<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> . . . voiced earnest hope that <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> could become ‘more organic’ and provide <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> with some concrete guaranty and specific information regarding kind of assistance <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> could provide in event of emergency . . . <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> explained nature of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and expressed personal view that overt <gloss target="#t_VM1">VM</gloss> aggression improbable in foreseeable future but that if it should take place would almost surely involve other <gloss>SEA</gloss> countries . . . It was his view that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s primary problem was that of internal security. This he did have capability of solving and he should devote all his efforts to this end.” (Telegram 2638 from Saigon, December 30; Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/12–3055)</note></p>
<pb xml:id="pg_611" n="611" facs="0641"/>
<p>The President started the meeting by describing the conditions within South Vietnam as he saw them. He said that since the inception of his government the Viet Minh had been carrying out a strategy in South Vietnam of staying under cover and attempting to undermine his government by political subversion and propaganda. The recently completed elections had made it quite clear to the world, and to the Viet Minh, that these tactics had failed. Since that time, therefore, Viet Minh tactics had changed. They had come out of hiding, and had begun to engage in a widespread campaign of terrorism which was aimed at creating such chaotic conditions in South Viet Nam as might bring the fall of the government. The President said that in the central portion of his country these efforts had not been too successful. He attributed this lack of success to the relatively high level of political education possessed by the population in the central region. This portion of the population, according to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, were well aware of the stakes involved in this political battle, and were solidly behind him and his government. The situation in the North and South of the country, he described as much more serious. In these areas (and particularly in the South), the people were more thinly spread geographically and more naive politically. They were not fully aware of the issues involved in the struggle, and were more susceptible to Communist propaganda and more amenable to Communist terrorist pressures. He went on to say that although the dissident sects had suffered severe defeats in the recently completed fighting in and around Saigon, the remnants of one of the sects was firmly entrenched along the Southwest border of the country in the vicinity of Tran Chau. The Viet Minh had succeeded largely in taking over this organization, and in providing the leadership for the fighting which is presently going on in this area. Everything which the President said about the internal situation indicated to me that he was much more worried about the task of preserving internal order than I had thought possible.</p>
<p>The President said he had three major plans of action in mind to attempt to control this new and vigorous Viet Minh campaign in the country. First, he intended to step up the tempo of operations against the organized dissidents in the South of the country. One Vietnamese division was engaged in this action, and two more were due to join in the near future. Secondly, he intended to conduct a widespread campaign of political education in order to try to convince the population that their best interests lay in support of his government. Lastly, he hoped to form in each of some 6,000 Vietnamese villages a small village militia of about ten men. He hoped to have U.S. support in order to arm these militiamen and to finance the effort. His thought was that these militiamen would devote their full time to the security job. He felt that the presence in each village of an armed <pb xml:id="pg_612" n="612" facs="0642"/>and organized group would provide the surest means available of combating the widespread terrorist activities of small Viet Minh groups. I interrupted at this point to tell the President that I was very surprised at what he had told me. I said that the election results seemed to indicate that he had a wide basis of population support within the country. It seemed to me that such public support of the government would make very difficult Viet Minh terrorist activities of the type he had described, since the operation of small Viet Minh groups within Vietnam required both acquiescence and active support on the part of the population. I mentioned, for example, that one of the things that made Viet Minh guerrilla activities so difficult to combat during the Indo-China War had been the fact that the Viet Minh were able to disappear into the villages, where to the French they were indistinguishable from the other villagers. The Viet Minh had also been able to subsist from the countryside during these operations. I said I did not understand how they were able to operate in a similar situation in Viet Nam today. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said that the elections had demonstrated widespread support for his government, but that the political naivete of the people made them incapable of effectively opposing Viet Minh terrorist activities. He said that neither the Army nor the police were able to cover every village and hamlet in Vietnam, and that only the formation of a militia group in each village would insure effective opposition. (I noted, but did not comment on the fact, that it would be most difficult to select proper individuals to arm from amongst a population whose loyalties were as uncertain as the President’s conversation seemed to indicate.)</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> then went on with a description of the threat of overt Viet Minh aggression with which he felt his country was faced. A summation of his description is as follows. Viet Minh forces could easily cross the 17th parallel, and rapidly overrun the Northern section of the country. They also had considerable capability to infiltrate through mountain trails on the Northwest borders of the country. Such infiltration would involve transit through Laos, but, according to the President, this route was being widely used by the Viet Minh to infiltrate agents into his country. He also said that the Communists had a great capability for landing forces along the Viet Namese Coast from junks, and indicated that he did not feel that the Viet Namese presently had sufficient capability to effectively spot and oppose these landings. Throughout his discussion of the Viet Namese capabilities, the President indicated that in his opinion these forces could move rapidly over areas containing few if any roads, and that they could make these movements in sufficient force to overcome the resistance with which they would be faced. On the other hand in discussing the Viet Namese capabilities to oppose such overt action, the President stressed the present lack of motor transportation in the <pb xml:id="pg_613" n="613" facs="0643"/>Viet Namese forces which, he said, would seriously handicap their resistance. I pointed out to the President the inconsistency of his views with regard to Viet Minh capabilities as opposed to his own, and said that I did not understand how he expected the Viet Minh to move such large forces rapidly without large motor transport. In replying to this question, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> simply restated his previous opinion that the Viet Minh could do it because of their organization and training, but that his forces were organized to utilize motor transportation and needed it to carry out their plans. I then said that I felt the Vietnamese Navy should be able to do a better job than they had done of interrupting or interfering with Communist seaborne infiltration along the Viet Namese Coast. I said that I believed an aggressive campaign on the part of the Viet Namese Navy to capture or sink Communist junks seemed within the capabilities of the Navy. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> then launched into a description of the French lack of cooperation in this regard. The summation of his remarks can be made in two points. First, he felt that the French refused to assist with naval forces in stopping Communist traffic into Viet Nam. Secondly, he believed that the French were actually assisting and cooperating with the Viet Minh in bringing personnel and supplies by sea into Viet Nam. The President did not believe that the efforts of the Viet Namese Navy could be successful until or unless an end were put to the duplicity of the French Naval Forces in Viet Nam.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> then returned to the subject of organized dissident activity in the South. He pointed out that a considerable part of the Viet Namese Military Establishment had to be devoted to combating this type of activity and to preserving order within the country. While engaged in such tasks, he said, these forces were unable to carry out the training which was necessary in order to prepare them for their primary job of being able to resist overt aggression from the Viet Minh. For this reason, he felt it most important that he receive U.S. support of his plan to arm a militia in order that he could return the regular forces to their primary job of training. The President then described at some length the overall Viet Namese plan for defense of the country. This plan is based upon a division of the country into four sectors, each under an overall Army commander. The supply system is being built in such a fashion so as to be able to support these sector commanders in their operations. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> pointed out one of the great lacks in the supply system was the lack of adequate transportation nets to support and serve the system. He said that he hoped the United States would be able to furnish the financial aid and heavy machinery necessary to build an adequate road net to support this logistic system. Throughout this portion of the discussion, I was struck by the fact that the President considered the chief danger to his country lay in the possibility of overt aggression from <pb xml:id="pg_614" n="614" facs="0644"/>the North. To this end, he was very concerned with freeing the Armed Forces from their internal security tasks so that they could train and prepare to resist such an invasion. On the other hand, the conditions he described were primarily dangerous because of the lack of internal stability within the country. In point of fact, these conditions seem to me very like those which existed in the Philippines in 1950 and 1951. I mentioned this similarity to the President, and suggested he might study the methods used by President Magsaysay to restore internal stability to the Philippines during this period.<note n="3" xml:id="d286fn3">President Magsaysay was Minister of Defense during this period.</note> <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> indicated that this might be worthwhile, but immediately thereafter returned to his theme of preparing the Armed Forces to resist Viet Minh overt aggression. Although I made several attempts to point out the desirability of using the Armed Forces for internal security, I do not believe that President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> changed any of the preconceived ideas he had at the beginning of our meeting.</p>
<p>This meeting with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was both surprising and, in some ways, disappointing to me. He was much more pessimistic concerning the conditions in South Viet Nam than I had supposed that he would be. He quite evidently feels that the French are not only failing to cooperate with his government, but are actually working against him in cooperating with the Viet Minh. From the amount of interest which he showed in the military situation and the great detail in which he discussed it, I would surmise that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> himself is actually functioning as the Minister of Defense of his country. If this is so, I would say that his grasp of the problem which faces him is defective and will not be corrected unless it be through the medium of U.S. advice to him.</p>
<p>Throughout our conversation, I was impressed by the seriousness with which the President tackles his job, and by the obvious honesty of purpose which inspires him.<note n="4" xml:id="d286fn4"><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> included a briefer summary of this conversation in his trip report to the Secretary of Defense dated February 7, 1956. At the end of the Vietnam section of that report he stated: “All of my meetings at Viet Nam clearly pointed up the fact that the size of our <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> must be increased if we are to make an effective fighting force out of the Viet Namese military establishment. The present self-imposed limitation under the Geneva Accords puts a ceiling upon our <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> personnel which is far short of our present requirements in Viet Nam. If and when further withdrawals or reductions of the French forces in Viet Nam occur, the shortage of U.S. personnel will become even more acute.” (Naval Historical Center, <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> Papers, 333.1 (Trip 9) 12/12/55–1/19/56)</note></p>

<p>3.

<item>Report of Defense–State–<gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> Special Mission to Free Viet-Nam (November–December 1955)</item>
</list>
<p>You will recall that a Special Survey Mission was sent to Saigon in November 1955 to collect and evaluate information on which to base decisions regarding the amount of funds to be allocated in support of the Vietnamese forces in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 and to seek from Congress for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957. The Mission was headed by Major <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Lawton</persName>, Chief of the Budget, Department of the Army.</p>
<p>The Mission has now presented its report.<note n="2" xml:id="d288fn2">Not found.</note> A summary of this report is attached which you may wish to distribute to other officials <pb xml:id="pg_617" n="617" facs="0647"/>in the Department. I believe it would also be useful if you could talk with <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Lawton</persName>, for he feels very strongly about the conditions he found in Viet-Nam.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation</p>
<p>That the attached summary be sent to the Under Secretary, to Mr. Hill, Special Assistant to the Under Secretary for Mutual Security Affairs, and to Mr. Prochnow, Deputy Under Secretary for Economic Affairs.<note n="3" xml:id="d288fn3">A marginal note indicates that this recommendation was carried out on January 23.</note></p>
<p><hi rend="strong">[Attachment]</hi></p>
<p rend="center">SUMMARY OF THE <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">LAWTON</persName> MISSION REPORT</p>
<p>The cost of maintaining the Vietnamese forces in 1955 was substantially less than anticipated. In early 1955 it had been anticipated that the cost would be $315 million of which the U.S. would contribute $235 million. Present estimates are that when the accounting period is completed costs will total $223 million of which $143 million will be contributed by the U.S. It is anticipated that the balance of funds allocated for support in 1955 will be carried over to help meet costs in 1956.</p>
<p><gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Saigon estimated that costs in 1956 would be $218 million, which the Survey Team recommends be reduced to $184 million. Principal recommended reductions are in construction and matériel. Both <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Saigon and the Survey Team recommended inclusion in the military budget for military support of $6 million for the village militia in which President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is very interested. The estimated Vietnamese contribution would be $20 million, leaving costs of $170 million to be covered by the U.S.</p>
<p><gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Saigon estimates that total costs in 1957 would be $220 million which the Survey Team recommends be reduced to $185 million. Again, principal reductions are in construction and materiel and both recommend $6 million for the village militia. The Vietnamese contribution is again estimated at $20 million leaving $171 million to be covered by the U.S.</p>
<p>Up to the present time <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Saigon has placed principal emphasis on training and remarkable progress has been made in the last eighteen months. However, due to lack of progress in logistics and administration, the Mission doubts that the Vietnamese Army could <pb xml:id="pg_618" n="618" facs="0648"/>conduct sustained combat because of its inability to supply and distribute. The Mission considers it impossible to give proper attention to the problem of logistics and administrative training within the existing <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> personnel ceiling of 342.</p>
<p>With regard to <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> supplies shipped in, the French followed the practice of opening all packing cases upon receipt thereby often losing the means of identifying the items received. As a consequence, there are large quantities of supplies and equipment now in Viet-Nam which cannot be identified and the process of identification, sorting, and warehousing these items will be almost endless given the present French personnel. The situation might be even worse if the items were dumped on the Vietnamese, in view of their lack of training, or dumped on the U.S., in view of an even more acute shortage of personnel. A correction of this condition would result in considerable savings to the U.S., since some equipment is now exposed to the elements and is deteriorating, and due to lack of information the U.S. is probably shipping in, or will be called upon to ship in, supplies which already exist in Viet-Nam.</p>
<p>The French have been selling supplies and matériel to the Vietnamese and will shortly begin negotiations to sell fixed installations in South Viet-Nam to the Vietnamese. Presumably these supplies and matériel are of French origin but some cases have already been found where these items were of U.S. origin and given to the French by the U.S. Also, the U.S., through the aid program to the French budget, may have contributed to the construction of the fixed installations. Since we are now supporting the Vietnamese budget the U.S. may be paying for some items a second time.</p>
<p>The Mission believes that the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> controller needs additional staff in order to control expenditures of U.S. funds and train the Vietnamese in budget, fiscal, and auditing procedures.</p>

<item>Problem of the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Ceiling in Vietnam</item>
</list>
<pb xml:id="pg_619" n="619" facs="0649"/>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Problem</p>
<p>1. The Secretary of Defense and the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> have strongly recommended in the attached letter to you (Tab A<note n="2" xml:id="d289fn2">This letter from <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, December 13, is not attached to the source text. See <ref target="#d287fn3">footnote 3, Document 287</ref>.</note>) that we allow <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Viet-Nam to exceed the ceiling of 342 under which they have been operating since the coming into force of the Armistice Agreement in July 1954, by authorizing the replacement of withdrawing French military training and technical personnel by American military training and technical personnel. The Director of Central Intelligence supports the position of Defense and <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> (Tab B<note n="3" xml:id="d289fn3">This support was in the form of a memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">John Foster Dulles</persName>, December 16, not attached to the source text. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.5/12–1655)</note>).</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion</p>
<p>2. On December 17, 1954, you affirmed to <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> that we had no intention of increasing <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Viet-Nam beyond the level obtaining when the Geneva Armistice entered into force. You stated this raised a real problem with respect to training the Vietnamese and would require continuing use of French military personnel (Tab C<note n="4" xml:id="d289fn4">Tab C, <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 11 from Paris, December 17, 1954 is not attached to the source text; for text, see <ref target="frus1952-54v13p2"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, vol. XIII, Part 2</ref>, p. 2385.</note>). This position has subsequently been reaffirmed privately from time to time to Indian and French officials.</p>
<p>3. The withdrawal of French forces from Viet-Nam has taken place at a far more rapid rate than was anticipated. French troop strength prior to Geneva, in 1954, was on the order of 185,000, whereas only about 30,000 French troops now remain, of whom only 122 are engaged in the combined training activity (as against 268 in April, 1955).</p>
<p>4. Defense and <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> have advised you that unless they can exceed the 342 ceiling in the immediate future, the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> military objective for Viet-Nam will have to be revised downward so as to reflect a lesser mission which might reasonably be accomplished by <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Viet-Nam with personnel not exceeding 342.</p>
<p>5. <gloss target="#t_L1">L</gloss> considers the first paragraph of Article 16 of the Armistice Agreement obscure. One possible interpretation permits the substitution of U.S. training and technical personnel for similar departed French personnel, since this would not result in any “additional military personnel” in Viet-Nam (Tab D<note n="5" xml:id="d289fn5">Tab D, a memorandum from <gloss target="#t_L1">L</gloss>, December 6, is not attached to the source text and has not been found. The argument referred to here, however, is repeated verbatim in a later memorandum from <gloss target="#t_LFE1">L/FE</gloss> to <persName corresp="#p_HRE1">Hoey</persName>, December 21. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.5–MSP/12–1355)</note>). However, it can be argued <pb xml:id="pg_620" n="620" facs="0650"/>with equal force that U.S. military personnel is restricted to the number in Viet-Nam at the time of the armistice. This is the view taken by the British in November 1954 (Tab E<note n="6" xml:id="d289fn6">Tab E, described in the list of attachments as “British legal interpretation, November, <hi rend="italic">1955</hi>” (italics added) is not attached to the source text and has not been found.</note>). <gloss target="#t_L1">L</gloss> points out that the International Commission is responsible for supervision of the introduction of military personnel (Article 36), and will probably interpret the Agreement to limit U.S. military personnel to the number in Viet-Nam at the time of the armistice.</p>
<p>6. The Embassy at Saigon “fully realizes the need for additional <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_TRIM1">TRIM</gloss> (training) personnel and does not challenge the military arguments for wishing to disregard restrictions resulting from the Armistice Agreement”. However, it points out that the political repercussions of a possible change of policy prior to July 1956 might be very serious and might afford other parties involved the opportunity of placing the onus for collapse of the Geneva settlement on the U.S. doorstep.</p>
<p>7. The Embassy’s political objections to a change of policy are spelled out in fuller detail in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the attached staff study which also details some of the legal aspects of this question (Tab F<note n="7" xml:id="d289fn7">This staff study, also drafted by <persName corresp="#p_KPM1">Kattenburg</persName>, is not attached to the source text. Text of the study, which is essentially the same as this memorandum but in greater detail, is in Department of State, Central Files, 751G.5–MSP/1–1655.</note>).</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Courses of Action</p>
<p>8A. If you determine that we should inform the Secretary of Defense and Director of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> that we consider permissible the replacement of withdrawn French training and technical personnel by American military personnel in similar functions, it is recommended:</p>
<list>
<item>(1) That you inform <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Sir Anthony Eden</persName> during his forthcoming visit<note n="8" xml:id="d289fn8">The reference is to British Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony Eden</persName>’s visit to Washington, January 30–February 1, 1956.

<item>(2) That you inform the Secretary of Defense that, in the additional staffing of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Viet-Nam over 342, Defense should not exceed, without prior concurrence by State, a number to be jointly determined by State and Defense.</item>
<item>8B. If, on the other hand, you determine that it is preferable at this time not to depart from the 342 ceiling, it is recommended that <pb xml:id="pg_621" n="621" facs="0651"/>you inform the Secretary of Defense that our policy will be kept under constant review for the next few months and that we will interpose no objection to Defense personnel practices designed to keep the full effective strength of the military component of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Viet-Nam at 342 on duty in Viet-Nam at all times.<note n="9" xml:id="d289fn9">There is no indication on the source text of approval or disapproval of these two courses of action, but the instructions in telegram 2503 to Saigon, <ref target="#d291">Document 291</ref>, make it clear that 8B was approved.</note></item>

I urged him, as I have on previous occasions, that we consider it important that National Assembly be elected and established as soon as possible and particularly in time to meet whatever problems the new year might bring forth.” The telegram concludes as follows:</p>
<p>“As I was leaving, a person close to the President whispered in my ear his hope that Washington would press <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> not to postpone further the date of elections; he said there was quite a heaving and hauling on this point with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in the middle.

<p>1. Following are Embassy comments, from political viewpoint, on possibilities suggested by Department. This message has not been coordinated with <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>.</p>
<list>
<item>a. Civilian personnel. No objection introduction additional US civilian personnel. However if such personnel subject military law <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> would presumably consider their entry in same terms as entry military personnel. <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> position on this point taken August 25 (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1880<note n="3" xml:id="d292fn3">Not printed.</note>) but we believe it might be subject revision and suggest Department may wish sound out Canadians and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> on possibility. Pertinent to note that entry into North Vietnam of Chinese and satellite civilian technicians and advisors (of which <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> is of course aware) has not become an issue.</item>
<item>b. Military in civilian status would be obviously less desirable than civilians since there would always be possibility their military connection would become known and subject of complaint.</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_624" n="624" facs="0654"/>
<item>c. Contracts with business firms for <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> redistribution assistance would present no apparent problems. However, we believe US should continue to insist French furnish adequate elements to meet their commitments toward US with respect <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> turnovers.</item>
<item>d. <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> elements attached to <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>. Considered probable Vietnamese and US military would be reluctant to go along with such procedure. French would probably also be reluctant unless this part of arrangement for French military mission.</item>
<item>e. Attaching additional French to <gloss target="#t_TRIM1">TRIM</gloss> would not be politically desirable in view of Vietnamese distrust of French and distaste of Vietnamese troops for French instructors. Trend is in opposite direction and we understand Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> favors further reduction, specifically with respect to French <gloss target="#t_TRIM1">TRIM</gloss> field advisors.</item>
<item>f. Theoretical excess of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> ceiling. Current <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> personnel practices allow for such excess which we consider reasonable and doubt <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> would view as violation Geneva Agreement.</item>

<p>On January 26, 1956, the National Security Council held its 274th meeting which was primarily concerned with the questions of United States policy in the control of armaments and export controls with the Communist bloc.

The following extract from that briefing deals with Vietnam:</p>
<list>
<item>“The Director of Central Intelligence indicated that in deferenoe to the importance and urgency of the other agenda items, he would restrict his intelligence briefing to comments on two situations where he perceived worrisome trends, namely, South Vietnam and Indonesia.</item>
<item>“<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was having serious troubles in Vietnam. Infiltration by the Vietminh from the north was increasing. At home, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s government was not sufficiently broad-based and elections were coming up in a few weeks. While on the whole <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had made a good record, the military situation in South Vietnam was not as good as might be hoped.</item>
<item>“<persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> interrupted at this point to say that in the course of his recent visit to the Far East he had talked to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> for two hours, and had derived from his talk a much worse picture of the situation in Vietnam than he had had when he left Washington. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had not singled out the military situation as being a particular worry, but had warned <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> about the dangers of Vietminh <pb xml:id="pg_625" n="625" facs="0655"/>penetration. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had indicated to <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> that he wished the village militia to be enlarged in order to cope more effectively with Vietminh penetration. Moreover, he had complained bitterly about the lack of French cooperation in preventing Vietminh infiltration, especially from the sea. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> added that he had spoken to the French <persName corresp="#p_JVAEA1">Admiral</persName> subsequently about this point, and the <persName corresp="#p_JVAEA1">Admiral</persName> had replied by stating that the Vietnam Navy itself was capable of preventing this infiltration; besides which, it was doubtful if the French Navy could assist <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, because such assistance would be contrary to the terms of the Geneva Convention. In any event, <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> stated that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> firmly believed that the French, at least those in the lower echelons, were actually assisting dissident groups in South Vietnam.

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Observations on Recent Far East Visit—Vietnam</item>
</list>
<p>Two serious problems in Vietnam require attention. The most urgent of these is the necessity to achieve an agreed upon plan (France–U.S.–Vietnam) for withdrawal of French forces. The present basis of action is an unplanned and unpredictable reduction of French forces, of ten at a rate exceeding the capacity of the Vietnamese to fill the resulting military vacuum. French forces are now maintained in Vietnam on an almost month-to-month authority. Funds for the continuance of French elements in Vietnam extend only to 20 March 1956. The Vietnamese are impatient about French withdrawal, want them out regardless. The French feel the Vietnamese are incompetent to take over and carry on. An objective plan that faced the realities and submerged animosities for the time being is badly needed and our mission should be encouraged to use its good offices <pb xml:id="pg_626" n="626" facs="0656"/>to this end. It may exceed the present authority which Paris has given <persName corresp="#p_JGPE1">General Jacquot</persName>, the local commander.</p>
<p>The second problem is produced by the present U.S. interpretation of the Geneva agreements. Our State Department holds that no more U.S. military personnel may be maintained in Vietnam than were there at the time of the Geneva truce. This has the effect of limiting the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Chief to about half the personnel needed for his training missions. Two solutions suggest themselves. One is to press for a more liberal interpretation of the Geneva Agreement that recognizes that U.S. forces might increase as French forces decrease. The other is to reach agreement with the Vietnamese and the French to the end that the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> may have the services of French technicians in the number needed. <persName corresp="#p_JGPE1">General Jacquot</persName> viewed this concept favorably, and President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would accede to it as a last resort, although much preferring U.S. personnel.</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Secretary: Since my letter to you of the 13th of December<note n="2" xml:id="d295fn2">See <ref target="#d287fn3">footnote 3, Document 287</ref>.</note> regarding the Viet-Nam situation, the Interagency Costing Team<note n="3" xml:id="d295fn3">See <ref target="#d263fn4">footnote 4, Document 263</ref>.</note> sent to Saigon to study military finance and related matters, has returned and submitted its report.<note n="4" xml:id="d295fn4">For a summary, see <ref target="#d288">Document 288</ref>.</note> The recommendations of the Team will lead to substantial improvements in budgeting, including savings of millions of dollars during the calendar year 1956. Steps have already been initiated to realize these savings.</p>
<p>The Team also studied the logistic situation in Free Viet-Nam and has reported deficiencies which are of greatest concern to me. Only by prompt action at highest departmental levels will it be possible to correct the problems.</p>
<p>Since the recent heavy phasedown in French forces, an adequate logistic capability in Free Viet-Nam no longer exists. The Team reported that “. . . the capability of supply of forces in the field in the <pb xml:id="pg_627" n="627" facs="0657"/>event hostilities should be resumed in mid-1956 would be virtually non-existent.”<note n="5" xml:id="d295fn5">Ellipsis in the source text.</note> From the standpoint of preservation of U.S. assets, the situation is also most unsatisfactory. Adequate control of <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> spares and supplies has, in large part, been lost.</p>
<p>We have concluded that not less than $100,000,000 worth of <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> material can be saved if prompt corrective action can be taken. Such action includes the availability in Viet-Nam in the immediate future of 150 to 200 Americans skilled in supply management and logistics.</p>
<p>A further essential factor in achieving effective supply control is the implementation of the <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> Minute of Understanding of 1 December 1954.<note n="6" xml:id="d295fn6">The text of the minute of understanding on the recovery of excess <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> equipment, as signed by <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> on December 1, 1954, is contained in telegram 1793 from Saigon as modified by telegram 2023 to Saigon, November 10 and 18, 1954. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.5–MSP/11–1054)</note> This Agreement provides for the return by the French of U.S. equipment no longer required for the purposes for which originally made available. The Agreement further states that decisions on what is to be returned should be made jointly by French and U.S. representatives. Nevertheless, the French are making these decisions unilaterally; it appears that they are carefully sorting out the useful, serviceable items for their own use, and returning the excess and salvage. We know of no valid reason why U.S. personnel should not be allowed to enter French military storage areas to participate in these determinations.</p>
<p>Your assistance in (a) making it somehow possible to bring in additional personnel, and (b) arranging with the French for effective implementation of the <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> Minute of Understanding is requested on an urgent basis. I recognize that in reaching your conclusions, you must also weigh other factors not discussed in this letter. To enable the Department of Defense to carry out its responsibilities in Free Viet-Nam, however, a solution along the lines discussed above is essential.</p>

<p>The subject of the Chinese Communist request for a new Geneva Conference on Indochina was discussed.<note n="2" xml:id="d296fn2">Text of <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>’s note of January 26 to the British (as cochairman of the Geneva Conference) condemning South Vietnam’s failure to abide by the terms of the Geneva Agreements and demanding convocation of the Conference is in telegram 2563 to Saigon, January 27. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> Central Files, 751G.00/1-2756)</note> The Secretary and Mr. Lloyd both opposed the idea.</p>
<p>The Secretary said that it was his understanding that President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> wished to wait until the South Viet-Nam elections on March 4 were held before proceeding any further on the question of consultations on all-Viet-Nam elections. The Secretary hoped that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would then take a new look at this whole question. In answer to Mr. Lloyd’s question as to whether <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had ever given any verbal indication that he would consider the question of free elections in Viet-Nam, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> replied that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had so indicated on several occasions but had insisted that conditions must exist which would insure that they would be genuinely free. He suggested <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> supervision.</p>
<p>The Secretary continued that he would discuss with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in mid-March if he visited Viet-Nam after the local elections with a view to try to persuade him to take a position regarding elections which could be construed as conforming to Geneva Agreement. However, the Secretary made clear he had no desire to push the Vietnamese <pb xml:id="pg_629" n="629" facs="0659"/>into rigged elections and assumed that the British would not do likewise. Mr. Lloyd agreed. The Secretary had in mind the concept of free elections such as <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Sir Anthony</persName> had proposed for Germany. For tactical reasons the Secretary felt that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should not oppose this concept. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> stressed the fact that the Vietnamese people were violently opposed to the Geneva Accords and that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> apparently felt he had to liquidate the rebellion of the sects and strengthen his internal position before risking an adverse public opinion in appearing to accept the Geneva Agreements.</p>
<p>In commenting on how to handle the Chinese Communist note regarding a new conference, Mr. Lloyd suggested the following procedure: (1) wait for the Soviet Government to get in touch with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> on the note; (2) then wait for the comments of the other participating members of the Geneva Conference which would take some time; and (3) then wait for the outcome of the March 4 elections in Free Viet-Nam if they have not already occurred and the replies of the Geneva Powers are not yet available. The Secretary said then he would talk with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> about the middle of March to try to get him to ease the situation. Mr. Lloyd indicated approval.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> made the point that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has already started to carry out consultations by an exchange of letters and radio announcements. Since this in effect amounts to consultations in the sense of the Geneva Agreement we should not accept allegations in the Chinese Communist letter that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has failed to consult. We can point to these exchanges as the reason for not needing a conference on Viet-Nam. <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Sir Harold Caccia</persName> stated his complete agreement with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>’s point and <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Sir Harold</persName> said he thought this was a very good line to take in handling the request for a new conference. It would be said that the Geneva Agreement was being carried out because <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has been exchanging views with the North.</p>
<p>Mr. Lloyd asked if the US believes the Communists desire elections in 1956 in Viet-Nam. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> replied that on the basis of available evidence . . . the Communists are becoming reconciled to a postponement of elections. Mr. Lloyd recalled that he had recently seen a paper which suggested that the Viet Minh would now like to have two or three years to undermine South Viet-Nam. <persName corresp="#p_GSHA1">Sir Hubert Graves</persName> confirmed that there had been an intimation from the Viet Minh of a three to five year postponement.</p>
<p>The Secretary in summary expressed his view that the Communists are anxious for a resumption of the Geneva Conference for broader purposes than just the question of elections on Viet-Nam. They will use that question as a pretext for urging for another conference to bring <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> into contact with the Western powers and as an excuse to set the stage for a major conference where both <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> could trot out proposals for a regional <pb xml:id="pg_630" n="630" facs="0660"/>pact, neutralization, etc. This would also give them a contact with the neutrals and a propaganda forum which would probably be their primary purpose in any conference. Mr. Lloyd agreed.</p>

Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he would talk to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> during his visit to the Far East in a month or so. It might be possible, after elections in Viet-Nam are held which are expected to give a legal basis to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s regime, that something can be done on this matter. If <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> still opposed elections, his opposition could be based upon the impracticability of holding free elections in the Viet-Minh area.</p>
<p>The situation in Laos was also discussed during the morning, with recognition that the Communists had not complied with the terms of the Geneva agreement. This non-compliance could be used as a basis for criticism of the Communists.</p>
<p>[Here follows discussion primarily on the off-shore islands question and Chinese representation in the United Nations.]</p>

<item>Logistics and Training Problems in Viet-Nam in Relation to <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Personnel Ceiling (Your meeting with Defense 5 p.m., February 2<note n="2" xml:id="d298fn2">For a report of that meeting, see <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</note>)</item>
</list>
<p>1. There are three distinct but related problems on this subject: a) training of the Vietnamese Army (Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s letter of December 13<note n="3" xml:id="d298fn3">See <ref target="#d287fn3">footnote 3, Document 287</ref>.</note>); b) implementation of the <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> Minute of Understanding of 1 December 1954<note n="4" xml:id="d298fn4">See <ref target="#d295fn6">footnote 6, Document 295</ref>.</note> providing for full return by French of U.S. equipment no longer required for purposes for which made available; and c) logistical support and training of the Vietnamese Army. <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> suggestions on solutions for these problems are contained in paragraph 6 of this memorandum.</p>
<p>2. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> has followed up his letter of December 13 regarding the handicaps faced by Defense in accomplishing its mission of training the Vietnamese Army under the 342 U.S. military personnel limitation (Tab A) by a new letter dated January 31<note n="5" xml:id="d298fn5"><ref target="#d295">Document 295</ref>.</note> on the <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> redistribution and logistical support problems raised in Viet-Nam by the recent heavy phase-down of French forces (Tab B). An Interagency Costing Team under <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General Lawton</persName> has recently studied this problem in Saigon and in submitting its conclusions and recommendations has reported logistical deficiencies which are of the greatest concern to Defense<note n="6" xml:id="d298fn6">See <ref target="#d288">Document 288</ref>.</note> (Tab C). Our assistance is requested on an urgent basis: a) to make possible the bringing in of additional personnel and b) to arrange with the French for effective implementation of the <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> Minute of Understanding.</p>
<p>3. The Secretary on January 19 decided we should not now authorize Defense to raise the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> ceiling by allowing substitution of U.S. for French military training and technical personnel.<note n="7" xml:id="d298fn7">See <ref target="#d289fn9">footnote 9, Document 289</ref>.</note> We should, however, study other ways and means of achieving our vital objectives despite assumed limitations on the number of U.S. military personnel. Greater use of civilian personnel, including military in civilian status if feasible (Suez Canal Base Formula<note n="8" xml:id="d298fn8">The reference is to an Anglo-Egyptian Agreement of October 19, 1954.</note>), contracts with <pb xml:id="pg_632" n="632" facs="0662"/>business firms for <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> redistribution assistance, exploration with French of possibility attaching <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> elements or individuals to <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and additional French to <gloss target="#t_TRIM1">TRIM</gloss> for specified period were suggested. We would also not object to personnel practices designed to keep the full effective strength of the military component of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Viet-Nam to 342 on duty in Viet-Nam at all times thus allowing theoretical excess of ceiling by average daily number of military personnel not on duty because of medical, leave, travel or other reasons.</p>
<p>4. Neither the Secretary’s decision of January 19 nor the suggestions above have yet been formally communicated to Defense. Our Ambassador at Saigon has concurred in general with the possibilities suggested.<note n="9" xml:id="d298fn9">See <ref target="#d292">Document 292</ref>.</note> (Tab D)</p>
<p>5. On January 24 the Vietnamese Government handed us a formal note<note n="10" xml:id="d298fn10">Text of this note is in telegram 2977 from Saigon, January 24. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.5/1–2456)</note> requesting that the U.S. send to Viet-Nam additional military instructions [<hi rend="italic">instructors?</hi>] to offset the evacuations of the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>. We have told Saigon not to respond to this request, but merely acknowledge it for the time being.<note n="11" xml:id="d298fn11">Telegram 2610 to Saigon, January 31, not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.5/1–1956)</note> At the same time, the Vietnamese Government has given a note to the French Government expressing “agreement” of the Viet-Nam Government to complete withdrawal of the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> from Viet-Nam. The French have not yet answered the note but have let it be known to our Embassy in Paris that they are in fact disposed and would be prepared to retain some <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> force in Viet-Nam provided Viet-Nam requests them to do so and does not pose preconditions no French Government is likely be able to meet.<note n="12" xml:id="d298fn12"><p>The Embassy had reported on the French reaction to the Vietnamese note in telegram 3327 from Paris, January 25:</p>
<p>“In sum <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> conveyed distinct impression French consider retention French force South Vietnam desirable.</p>
<p>“In response question, <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Roux</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_JGPE1">Jacquot</persName> estimated 12 to 15,000 <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> residual force could carry out training responsibilities Cambodia, Laos (including base complement Seno) and South Vietnam, as well [as] armistice responsibilities, protection <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> personnel et cetera South Vietnam.”</p>
<p>The Embassy commented that this information was in accordance with its previous view that France would be willing to maintain the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> around the 15,000-man level “provided Vietnam requests them do so and does not pose pre-conditions no French government likely be able meet.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.5/1–2556)</p></note></p>
<p>6. a) We believe solution of the <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> redistribution problem (<persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> Minute) lies mainly in getting the French to perform and we should consider a diplomatic approach to the French at the Washington and Paris level, if necessary. In regard to the logistics support of the Viet-Nam Army, we believe that in addition to <pb xml:id="pg_633" n="633" facs="0663"/>present <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and French capabilities in this respect, a possible solution might be the hiring of Japanese, Chinese, and Filipino personnel who were previously employed by the U.S. forces in their own countries and have been trained in U.S. supply procedures, as recommended on page 10 of the Interagency Costing Team Report. As regards both these problems, we think civilians on a contract basis and possibly soldiers out of uniform would also relieve the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>. In regard to training of the Army, the best present solution would seem to be to devote maximum number of spaces within <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> to that vital operation, including theoretical excess of ceiling as described in paragraph 3 above, b) Embassy Saigon states in telegram 3130, February 2<note n="13" xml:id="d298fn13">Not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.5/2–256)</note> (Tab E), that if present limitations on <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> personnel remain in effect, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> estimates approximately 1000 French troops would be required for period of about one year to implement <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> Minute effectively and another several hundred for indefinite period to continue training of the Army and Navy. The Embassy believes the Vietnamese could continue to demand withdrawal of the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> and at the same time agree to retention of such a residual force if these troops were given specific missions and a different label, such as French Military (or Liaison) Mission. The Embassy believes the Vietnamese Government might be induced to agree to retention of French personnel on this basis, and both Embassies Paris and Saigon believe the French might agree if requested by the Vietnamese and U.S.</p>

</list>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> indicated the meeting had been called to explore possible solutions to the urgent problems of logistics and training that we confront in Viet-Nam as a result of the 342 limitations on <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> personnel, which State had continued to be unwilling to lift. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> did not feel that this was an <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> problem at this stage but that we should for the present continue to seek mutually acceptable solutions.</p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_FLGAP1">Fox</persName> indicated that Defense needed twice the present number of its personnel in Saigon, or at least 636 personnel in the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>. If we could not do this there might be serious embarrassment for all of us, as the French were taking out all kinds of equipment, some of it was rotting away because of poor handling and neglect, and U.S. assets were being totally dissipated. Mr. McGuire underlined what <persName corresp="#p_FLGAP1">General Fox</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> had stated.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> asked whether the additional personnel to be sent in must be U.S. military in uniform. The Defense side stated that in their view they should be. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> again asked why it was necessary to have a sergeant wearing stripes. Could he not be a sergeant in civilian clothes? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> emphasized that we were in complete agreement as to the basic objectives, but that the Secretary and our lawyers felt only that we should not do this in such a way as to flaunt the Armistice openly and possibly bring about a highly dangerous Viet-Minh reaction. Could we not show more ingenuity in achieving this vital task of training the Army and retrieving our equipment?</p>
<p>The Defense legal representative stated that he saw no legal bar to sending additional military personnel; even if the first provision of Article 16 of the Armistice Agreement could not be interpreted as allowing U.S. military personnel to replace the French, it was a fact that <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> operated as part of the diplomatic mission and consequently did not have to be considered as military personnel, even though uniformed. Mr. Raymond replied that from the State legal <pb xml:id="pg_635" n="635" facs="0665"/>point of view several interpretations (in fact six of them) were possible and that it was not at all clear which was the right one.</p>
<p>Speaking for the Military Executive Agency in the area (Navy), Admiral Wilkins indicated that 636 personnel in <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> would achieve only the training objective. In order to realize all <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> needs, including the urgent task of retrieving U.S. equipment, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> needed a total of 1700–1800 personnel. . . . Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> indicated that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> had suggested in a very recent telegram that a French military Mission of about 1,000 might be left in Viet-Nam to perform on the <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> redistribution problem.<note n="3" xml:id="d299fn3">Telegram 3130 from Saigon, February 2, partially summarized <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> asked whether Defense would agree to this solution if the French and Vietnamese were willing to leave enough French in the field to do this.</p>
<p>Admiral Wilkins gave a highly tentative approval to this idea, provided in addition we could introduce 200 supervisory personnel to direct the operation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> asked whether these could be civilians, i.e. soldiers not in uniform. General Brown and the Defense legal representatives agreed to look into this matter, to explore it further, and to let us have their views.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> agreed that Defense should undertake further exploration of various suggested solutions and that they would communicate further with us on the entire problem.<note n="4" xml:id="d299fn4">See the memorandum of discussion at the State–<gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> meeting, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</note></p>

<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> mentioned yesterday’s [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] meeting<note n="2" xml:id="d300fn2">See the memorandum of conversation, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> between officers of the Department and a Defense Department group headed by <pb xml:id="pg_636" n="636" facs="0666"/>Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gordon Gray</persName> on the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> problem in Vietnam and the deterioration of U.S. equipment furnished earlier to the French in Indochina and now virtually abandoned in Vietnam. He continued that the matter had been brought to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ attention this morning and that the Secretary had directed immediate discussions with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Canada to enable us to send a sufficient number of personnel to salvage and maintain the U.S.-supplied equipment. The Secretary had reiterated his view that with sufficient ingenuity of approach we should be able to work ourselves out of the difficulty caused by the ceiling on the number of officers to be assigned to the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> for training purposes.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> observed that the sooner the French are out of Vietnam, as well as Laos and Cambodia, and the sooner we take over all training the better. He declared that French training is entirely inadequate and that the French presence now causes more trouble than it is worth. He suggested that perhaps the Thais could assist in replacing the French in Laos, for instance. He agreed with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName>’s recently expressed views that it is unrealistic to plan on strengthening the <gloss target="#t_TRIM1">TRIM</gloss> organization, and he remarked incidentally that he had not yet received the memorandum promised him by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> on his and the Ambassador’s conversation in December with French <persName corresp="#p_JVAEA1">Admiral Jozan</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d300fn3">Not found. A brief summary of this conversation, held December 29, is in <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>’s trip report to the Secretary of Defense dated February 7.

In response to an inquiry from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> as to the present role of the French navy in Vietnam and as to why it is not cooperating more fully with the Vietnamese, <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> stated that <persName corresp="#p_JVAEA1">Jozan</persName>’s ultimate aim is to arrange matters so that eventually France would have bases in Indochina similar to U.S. rights in the Philippines. However, he said, the French are unwilling now to give the Vietnamese proper assistance even in patrol activities, and there is suspicion that they are not above winking at Vietminh infiltration along the coast of Vietnam. The <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral</persName> declared that the whole situation out there is not going well, and he fears it will not get any better. In connection with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ view as to our problems under the Geneva agreement, <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> stressed that he would strongly recommend sending out people into Vietnam in uniform.

<p rend="center">THE GENERAL SITUATION IN SOUTH VIETNAM</p>
<p>The position of the government of South Vietnam is appreciably stronger than it was a year, or even six months ago. Within the past several weeks, however, signs of new political stresses have appeared, and the Communists are apparently stepping up their campaign against the South Vietnamese Government.</p>
<p>The coming months are likely to see new crises, in view of: 1) the Chinese Communist request on January 26 for a reconvening of the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina; 2) the absence of any real prospect that the nation-wide election, stipulated in the Final Declaration of the 1954 Geneva Conference, will be held by July; and 3) the reported increase in opposition to President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> and <pb xml:id="pg_638" n="638" facs="0668"/>the Communist attack on programs strengthening the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government, specifically, the March 4 election for a national constituent assembly.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Internal Security</p>
<p>Since the virtual elimination of the Binh Xuyen as a military force and the neutralization of a major portion of the <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> units, the principal threats to internal security in South Vietnam come from the clandestine Communist apparatus and from the remnants of the Hoa Hao sect. The Communists have an estimated 10,000 guerrillas in South Vietnam, scattered in small groups in rural areas but presumably still responsive to control from Hanoi. The principal infested areas are the plateau region of northern South Vietnam, the southern peninsula (Camau), and the canal-woven area southwest of Saigon where the Vietnamese National Army (<gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss>) is currently engaged in operations against Hoa Hao. Communist agents reportedly have been successful in infiltrating remaining Hoa Hao groups—chiefly <persName corresp="#p_BCGLQV1">Ba Cut</persName>’s organization. The latter’s increasingly effective defensive tactics have made recent <gloss target="#t_VNA1">VNA</gloss> operations relatively costly.</p>
<p>In addition to the continuing presence of these guerrilla elements, the Communists have presumably tried to penetrate all branches of the government. The most frequent reports suggest heavy penetrations of the Information Ministry. The absence of reliable information does not disprove some probable penetration of police and military services, particularly at lower levels. The Communists have a surviving capability to disrupt governmental operations, and perhaps to immobilize the regime, through a coordinated campaign of terror and assassination—a capability they have thus far chosen not to exercise.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Political Problems</p>
<p>The March 4 election will, in all probability, produce a national assembly that will overwhelmingly support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and approve the constitution that a pro-<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> commission has prepared. The constitution will establish a presidential system with separation of powers. Balloting will not indicate accurately the extent of anti-<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> sentiment, for a number of nationalist leaders, particularly refugees from the north, appear disinclined to risk censure or repression by contesting the election as opposition candidates.</p>
<p>It will be essential, in the immediate future, that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> have effective control over the administration and the national assembly. He has the support of the National Revolutionary Movement (<gloss target="#t_NRM1">NRM</gloss>), which has become, in effect his political party. There is some question, nevertheless, whether at present <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is unnecessarily antagonizing elements which might add strength to the future government. <pb xml:id="pg_639" n="639" facs="0669"/>He remains almost pathologically sensitive to criticism and potential opposition, with the result that the regime is becoming increasingly autocratic despite his democratic principles. In view of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s skill in dealing with dissident elements over the past year, it will perhaps be wise to give him the benefit of the doubt during the pre-election period.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Economic Conditions</p>
<p>There has been little recent change in the economic picture in South Vietnam. Rice prices, which rose precipitously during the summer and fall due largely to poor distribution, have now returned to normal. A major program for resettlement in southwest Vietnam of up to 100,000 of the refugees from the north is now developing, with US and other foreign support. If successful, it would simultaneously reduce the problems of 1) the refugees, 2) increased agricultural production, and 3) internal security in rural areas.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">International Aspects</p>
<p>The Chinese Communist request for a reconvening of the Geneva Conference broadened to include the International Control Commission members, probably indicates that the Communists will continue to drive for “reunification” of Vietnam by political and diplomatic means rather than by a resort to large-scale violence—at least until their proposal is definitively rejected. The Indians, as well as the Communist countries, will probably approve the call for a new conference. They apparently wish to see the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> continue in operation, which would require the Vietnamese to assume some of the function assigned to the French by the 1954 agreements.</p>
<p>The French are likely to continue the withdrawal of their forces (now reduced to about 15,000) in South Vietnam, to avoid formal termination of its informal mission to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> headed by <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">M. Sainteny</persName>, and—despite current opposition—may come to favor a new conference as a means of relief from their obligations under the 1954 agreements. The British have become increasingly reconciled to an extended partition of Vietnam, now have greater confidence in <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s strength, and would prefer to avoid or at least postpone a new Geneva Conference. The British, however, still hope that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> can be brought to accept some form of north-south consultation, even without prospect of success.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>General Donovan’s Letter of February 5 Concerning Elections in Vietnam.<note n="2" xml:id="d303fn2">In this letter, attached to the source text, retired General William J. Donovan, former Chief of the Office of Strategic Services, wrote to <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> in his role as honorary Chairman of the American Friends of Vietnam, an organization which described itself as “a non-partisan group organized in support of a free and democratic Republic of Vietnam.” Donovan asked <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> to reject <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>’s demand for a reconvocation of the Geneva Conference to implement provisions for elections in Vietnam in July 1956. Donovan urged that these elections be postponed until safeguards could be established under a new international supervising commission distinct from the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>.</note></item>
</list>
<p>I am in agreement with the views in General Donovan’s letter that elections in Vietnam should be deferred beyond the July date. His suggestion for the establishment of a new International Commission capable of insuring the necessary safeguards for free elections is under urgent consideration in the Department.</p>
<p>As you are aware, we reached agreement with the British in our recent talks that <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>’s demand for a reconvocation of the 1954 Geneva Conference should be rejected and that at a minimum we should await the outcome of the elections which President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will hold in South Vietnam on March 4 before undertaking further action on the diplomatic front with respect to the future of Vietnam.<note n="3" xml:id="d303fn3">See <ref target="#d296">Documents 296</ref> and <ref target="#d297">297</ref>.</note></p>

<item>2) the preservation of peace and security under some new arrangement which would permit gradual termination of the old Geneva Accords; and</item>

<p>1. <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> sees two separate and distinct problems in protecting <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> material assets: (1) processing Indo-China excesses; (2) preserving and instruction in use of equipment turned over to Vietnamese. Latter is much the greater and longer range problem. Best solution to (1) would be obtain effective French implementation of <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> minute of 1 December 1954. If French withdraw completely in near future estimate 232 US military supervisory personnel augmented by indigenous labor would be required solely to process Indo-China excesses. Best solution to (2) is to implement <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> table distribution plan Y supplemented by 1000 foreign technicians. If plan Y personnel requirements cannot be met in full, deletion of about 319 US personnel would be acceptable from logistic viewpoint only. Total plan Y thus reduced is 740, only 48 above total of present organization and proposed temporary mission. This 740 does not include 232 which would be needed if French do not implement <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> minute. These solutions provide most effective use of limited personnel and are most economical. It should be understood the <pb xml:id="pg_643" n="643" facs="0673"/>above figures need be augmented in event French Air Force and Naval Missions are discontinued.</p>
<p>2. <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> is less desirable than augmentation of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> because of its temporary nature.</p>
<p>3. If French could fully implement <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName> minute, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> estimates that after arrival of <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> personnel and technicians not less than 12 months would be required to overcome most critical deficiencies in Vietnamese logistics system. <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss>, if established, should be established initially with this minimum time requirement in mind.</p>
<p>Embassy views.</p>
<p>4. Embassy believes that if <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> proposal is for temporary mission to remove excess <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> equipment, it is ingenious idea which might well be acceptable to French, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Canadians. However, it is not clear to Embassy exactly what would be mission of proposed 350 man military logistic group. Paragraph 1 speaks of sending in additional US military personnel “solely for purpose recovering and preserving equipment now being lost due French withdrawal and lack <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> logistical capability”. <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> interprets this to mean that group would have dual mission of (a) supervising recovery and out-shipment of excess <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> equipment and (b) assisting in improvement of <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> logistical capabilities so as to preserve <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> equipment now in hands of <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> armed forces.<note n="3" xml:id="d304fn3">In telegram 2790 to Saigon, February 15, the Department stated that the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> interpretation was correct. “State informed by Defense these two tasks inseparable. . . Safeguarding U.S.-provided equipment also means showing Vietnamese how to maintain and protect it. Whether or not this has subsidiary effect increasing Vietnamese logistical capability (in itself desirable) essential purpose exercise is protect and preserve U.S. assets in matériel and equipment. . . We agree your para 7 that, regardless mission intended for <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss>, case should be presented to <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Canadians and French as a mission for the recovery and maintenance of equipment. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.5/2–1356)</note></p>
<p>It is also <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> interpretation that 1000 Filipino and/or Japanese technicians mentioned in <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> would have sole function of increasing logistical capability of <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> armed forces by giving on-the-job training to utilize and preserve their present equipment.</p>
<p>5. This interpretation placed somewhat in question by name suggested in paragraph 4 <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> for additional military group. “Temporary equipment recovery mission” (<gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss>) suggests recovery and not logistical training as mission of group.</p>
<p>6. If <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> interpretation correct, even after arrival of <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> there would still remain need for approximately 1000 French troops or their equivalent to process excess <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> equipment. In event of French failure to implement <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> minute, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> estimates that if 232 additional US military were assigned to supervise outshipment of excess <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss>, job could be done in about a year with help <pb xml:id="pg_644" n="644" facs="0674"/>of local Vietnamese labor (assuming proposed 1000 Filipino/Japanese techicians not assigned to this task).</p>
<p>7. Regardless of mission actually intended for <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss>, it seems clear that case for sending in such a group would be more likely acceptance by <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Canadians and French if it could be presented as solely an equipment recovery mission with a definite termination date. It is certainly arguable that a mission whose only purpose is to remove military equipment from Vietnam does not violate spirit of articles 16 and 17, which are aimed at preventing increase in military potential. Any indication that proposal included mission to increase logistical capabilities of <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> armed forces—in other words, training—would weaken case. French may be expected to have opinion based on own experience as to number of personnel required to complete removal of excess equipment.</p>
<p>8. In order for second proposal to have chance of obtaining concurrence of <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> majority (Canadians and Indians), it would seem necessary for US to agree to provide full information about movements and activities of <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> personnel.</p>
<p>9. <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> government would undoubtedly prefer Filipino to Japanese technicians but would probably be willing to accept Japanese if their numbers kept to minimum and it were clear that they were here under US, not Vietnamese auspices.</p>

<item>3. <hi rend="italic">Text of Note</hi>: “The Department of State informs the Embassy of the French Republic that the rapid withdrawal of French forces from Viet-Nam in recent months has created a situation of extraordinary concern to the Government of the United States with respect to the recovery, maintenance, and protection of Mutual Defense Assistance Program equipment in Viet-Nam. Under the <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> Minute of Understanding of December 1, 1954, the French Government has carried out obligations for the return of equipment no longer required for the purposes for which originally made available. While this task is well under way, it is not yet completed. Furthermore, vast amounts of equipment which are about to be or have already been turned over by the French forces in Viet-Nam are not now being adequately maintained and protected. Under these conditions, the Government of the United States is threatened by the possibility of losing tens of millions of dollars worth of equipment.</item>
<item>In view of these facts, the Government of the United States now feels itself obliged to dispatch to Viet-Nam, subject to Vietnamese agreement, and for a temporary period, a small number of additional United States military technical personnel whose sole function will be to supervise the recovery and maintenance of Mutual Defense Assistance Program equipment in Viet-Nam. This personnel will operate as a group known as the ‘Temporary Equipment Recovery Mission’ (<gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss>) and will not form an immediate part of the United States Military Advisory Aid Group in Viet-Nam.</item>
<item>The Government of the United States continues to depend upon the assistance of the French Government in completing the implementation of the <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> Minute of Understanding of December 1, 1954. For this specific purpose, and subject to an agreement between France and Viet-Nam, the Government of the United States would appreciate it if the French Government would retain in Viet-Nam for another year approximately 1,000 French military personnel to continue to participate in the task of processing Mutual Defense Assistance Program equipment.</item>
<item>If the French Government can accede, subject to Vietnamese agreement, to the assignment of approximately 1,000 French military personnel in Viet-Nam for the aforementioned purpose, the Government of the United States would be prepared to ask the Vietnamese Government to request the French Government to retain a French Military Mission in Viet-Nam. This mission could include the French <pb xml:id="pg_646" n="646" facs="0676"/>military personnel involved in equipment redistribution as well as that engaged in training the Vietnamese Air Force and Navy.</item>

<p>The French Ambassador called on the Secretary this afternoon to hand him the attached French reply<note n="2" xml:id="d307fn2">The French aide-mémoire, February 28, is attached to the source text in both original French and Department of State translation. It is summarized in this memorandum of conversation and is therefore not printed.</note> to the U.S. Aide-Mémoire of February 25<note n="3" xml:id="d307fn3">The text of this note is contained in <ref target="#d305">Document 305</ref>.</note> on the same subject.</p>
<p>The Ambassador informed the Secretary that the French Foreign Minister would like to talk this subject over with the Secretary in Karachi. The Ambassador explained that the American request for additional military personnel would be very difficult for France to accept because in the French view it would mean a violation by the United States of the Geneva Accord and French acquiescence thereto if France agreed to this temporary military mission. The Ambassador also pointed out that the whole question of Viet-Nam is now an acute problem for France because of the Vietnamese demand for the withdrawal of French forces. France must adhere to this demand in the light of its commitments in Geneva in 1954. If the French forces are to be withdrawn from Viet-Nam it also means dissolution of the French High Command. The Ambassador said that France would not retain any responsibilities under the High Command if French forces are withdrawn. The Ambassador pointed out that the fundamental question is who will have responsibility under the Armistice in carrying out the Agreement? France does not desire this responsibility after the French High Command is dissolved. However, it might be possible for France to retain some responsibilities in Viet-Nam if that would not imply arty large commitment under the Armistice.</p>
<p>The Secretary stated that the United States could not leave such a huge amount of equipment in such unprotected condition in Viet-Nam.</p>
<p>The Secretary also stated that the United States does not believe that a temporary group of technical personnel would violate the <pb xml:id="pg_649" n="649" facs="0679"/>Cease-Fire Accord. He informed the Ambassador that he would obtain the views of the Defense Department on the French note so that he would be in a position to discuss this with Foreign Minister Pineau in Karachi.</p>

<head>308. Editorial Note</head>
<p>On March 4, South Vietnam held elections for its National Constituent Assembly, the first task of which was to be the formulation of a new constitution for Vietnam based on a draft prepared by the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government. The results of the election were announced on March 8 as follows: National Revolutionary Movement 47 seats, Independents 39, Citizens Community 18, Movement for Freedom 11, and 5 small parties won a total of 8 seats. According to telegram 3655 from Saigon, March 8, it was the view of the Embassy in Saigon that party lines in the new assembly were likely to be subordinate to the overwhelmingly pro-<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> orientation of the body as a whole. Only 33 of the 123 seats were won by people who had run against candidates unofficially favored by the government. Consequently, the Embassy did not foresee much opposition to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s draft constitution. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/3–856)</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Various Issues in Europe, North Africa, Middle East, and Far East</item>
</list>
<p>[Here follow Pineau’s remarks on Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.]</p>
<p>With respect to Vietnam, Mr. Pineau also regretted that there was no common policy. There is the impression, perhaps a wrong one, that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is being encouraged in an anti-French policy. This is highly embarrassing to France. He admitted that the French Government had perhaps been wrong in not proposing a different solution than the policy of backing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. He also said that the French Government had been wrong in not being frank enough with the U.S. and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> even after they agreed to support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. The net result has left France in an inferior position vis-à-vis the U.S. in Vietnam. Now the situation is becoming critical. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has not established a national union which he should have. The Vietminh can bring about an extremely dangerous situation by subversion.</p>
<p>Then there is another difficult situation caused by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s demand for the withdrawal of French troops. Although the Geneva Accords are contradictory, they do compel France to comply with such a demand. The French do not regret the withdrawal of French troops from Vietnam since they are needed in North Africa. However, the withdrawal does present the French with some difficult legal complications. If the troops are withdrawn that will mean abolition of the French High Command. Then it will be difficult for France to carry out its obligations under the Geneva Accords.</p>
<p>Another problem in Vietnam arises out of the presence of a considerable amount of American military matériel. Mr. Pineau supposed that most of this had been turned over to the Vietnamese as this was the American desire, but he did not know what the Vietnamese had done with it. In any event, he said that the U.S. ought to have control over this matériel and see to its upkeep. Unfortunately, the sending of U.S. military personnel seemed to be contrary to the Geneva Accords. That left only two ways of meeting the problem. The U.S. could send civilian personnel or <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could ask to retain French military personnel to control this equipment.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_651" n="651" facs="0681"/>
<p>Mr. Pineau said that he had had a talk with Selwyn Lloyd who told him of the proposed meeting of the co-chairmen.<note n="2" xml:id="d309fn2">On February 25, the British Ambassador in Saigon handed an aide-mémoire to U.S. Embassy officials asking for U.S. views on an Indian proposal that the cochairmen of the Geneva Conference discuss the situation in Vietnam, as an alternative to the demand of the People’s Republic of China, supported by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Soviet Union, for reconvocation of the Geneva Conference. The British suggested that the mid-April 1956 visit of Soviet leaders to Great Britain would provide a convenient time for such a meeting. The Department of State was not opposed to such a meeting, which it considered “vastly preferable” to a conference. (Telegram 2914 from Saigon, February 27; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> Central Files, 751G.00/2–2456) Text of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> aide-mémoire is <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/2–2556.</note> Pineau remarked that such a meeting would be useful.</p>
<p>Mr. Pineau brought up the French mission in North Vietnam. He said that his government wished to maintain a cultural and economic mission there under Mr. Sainteney. By the same token, the Vietnamese want to establish a mission in Paris which, in fact, they already have there.</p>
<p>As to Communist China, Mr. Pineau stated that the position of the Socialist Party is to recognize the Communist regime. However, the present French Government have firmly decided against taking any action under present circumstances. France would have only a commercial mission in Peiping which would be limited to commercial matters and have no diplomatic status. If the Chinese Communists wanted to, they might send a small commercial mission to Paris. Mr. Pineau said that the question of trade with Communist China was in a different category than recognition.</p>
<p>[Here follow <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ remarks on Europe, North Africa, and the Near East.]</p>
<p>Turning to the Far East, the Secretary said that he would see President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in Saigon to urge him to adopt a more conciliatory attitude towards the International Control Commission and to favor nationwide elections on the basis of genuinely free conditions. The Secretary thought that on a psychological basis, it would be wise for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to come out strongly in favor of free elections. The Secretary pointed out that there was no more than a remote likelihood that free elections would ever be accepted in North Vietnam. In any event, we should not press <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to hold elections unless and until conditions existed which would insure that elections would in reality be free. Mr. Pineau indicated his full agreement.</p>
<p>Regarding U.S. military equipment in Vietnam covered by the <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> Agreement, the Secretary explained that the United States attaches great importance to examining this equipment, determining its condition, and salvaging as much as possible. He said that it might amount to as much as five hundred million dollars’ worth of matériel, although this might be an exaggeration. The United States <pb xml:id="pg_652" n="652" facs="0682"/>believed it would be consistent with the armistice to send 350 military personnel on a temporary basis in civilian clothes. They would work under Department of Defense. Their job would be to make an inventory of this equipment and save it from being exposed to the weather and other conditions. The Vietnamese have no facilities for controlling this equipment which they can use. Moreover, the United States is under some pressure to send the types of matériel which may already be in Vietnam. The Secretary also emphasized that the United States is entitled to do this under the agreement with the French. It seems consistent with the cease-fire accord so long as the United States is not adding to the fighting strength in Vietnam. The Secretary said he expected to discuss this with <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName><note n="3" xml:id="d309fn3">See <ref target="#d311">Document 311</ref>.</note> and hoped to satisfy him that it would be consistent with the armistice. Unless <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> takes a strong stand, the Secretary indicated the United States would proceed with the recovery mission. He expressed the hope that the French would help us. However if <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> should strongly oppose this project, then the United States would have to reconsider what line to take.</p>
<p>Concerning the training of Vietnamese forces, the Secretary told Mr. Pineau that the United States would consider it a contribution to the common cause if France would maintain training personnel for the Vietnamese air force and navy (220 and 70 men, respectively). French instructors are necessary in view of the severe limitation of approximately 342 American instructors. If the French trainers are removed and can not be replaced by Americans, there would be a serious loss in the Vietnamese military build-up.</p>
<p>Regarding the responsibilities for carrying out the armistice, the Secretary said that the cease-fire accords were loosely drawn and constitute an incoherent area. Vietnam has the right to request French withdrawal, but France and not Vietnam has the responsibility for executing the accord. Pineau replied that if the United States desires to have French military personnel remain in Vietnam, then <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> must request it from France since it is not up to the United States. The Secretary agreed. Mr. Pineau also pointed out the French view that there has developed in Vietnam an atmosphere so hostile to the French that it is almost impossible for them to stay on. As illustration he said that <persName corresp="#p_JGPE1">General Jacquot</persName> had been arrested and “nearly assassinated” in Saigon by a Vietnamese army patrol a few days ago. This underlined the necessity for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to request the French to stay and to make it possible.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> explained that of some billion two hundred million worth of equipment, about five hundred million has been turned over to the Vietnamese. Much of it is lying out in open spaces. It <pb xml:id="pg_653" n="653" facs="0683"/>includes quantities of spare parts needed by the Vietnamese. As a result of the sudden and rapid withdrawal of the French forces, this equipment had been turned over to the Vietnamese without inventory—nobody knows how much. In order to continue the <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> Agreement, 1,000 French personnel would be needed in addition to 350 Americans. The job of recovery and control would probably take from 6 to 12 months.</p>

<p>After Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> had briefed the Council on the highlights of the subject Progress Report, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> requested permission to point up more recent developments since the cut-off date of the Progress Report. Before doing so, he stated that our present policies with respect to Southeast Asia needed to be brought up to date, though many of them remain generally valid. Moreover, he pointed out, the news from Southeast Asia was by no means all bad.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> then commented on the closing of the U.S. Consulate at Hanoi on December 11, 1955. He referred to the happy results of the recent election in Free Vietnam, which had resulted in strong support of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s government. It was estimated that 83% of those eligible to vote had actually voted. This was very heartening in view of the threats made by the Vietminh to disrupt this election. It was also pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName> was just back from Vietnam, and reported the situation there to be very encouraging.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> then said he would like to review with the Council the proposals which will be presented to Congress in connection with the request for appropriations for assistance to the several countries of Southeast Asia. We would be asking for an increase in funds earmarked for Vietnam. About the same amount as for the present fiscal year would be requested for Laos. There would be a slight increase in funds requested for Cambodia, and a marked increase in requests for assistance to Thailand. Whereas the total amount requested for assistance to these countries for the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 programs had amounted to $386 million, we would be asking for $491 million for the programs for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> concluded with the expressed judgment that within the above programming the Administration was doing everything possible that could be done to achieve the objectives of the United States in the area of Southeast Asia. He furthermore predicted an interesting report when the Secretary of State returned from his current trip to the Far East.</p>
<p>The President inquired as to the date of the return of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> replied that he would return about March 22. The President said he was glad to hear this. He had had a recent request that the subject of the Bricker Amendment in its latest version should be the subject of discussion at a Congressional leaders <pb xml:id="pg_655" n="655" facs="0685"/>meeting at The White House in the immediate future.<note n="3" xml:id="d310fn3">For documentation on the issue, see <ref target="frus1952-54v01p2"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, vol. I, Part 2</ref>, pp. 1768 ff.</note> He had preferred to wait until the Secretary of State got back. Meanwhile, said the President, he wished to heck he could get the whole Bricker Amendment blown to kingdom come.</p>
<p>Governor Brucker, the Acting Secretary of Defense, then referred to the desire of the Defense Department to augment the size of the Military Assistance Advisory Group in Vietnam. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> replied that he sympathized with this objective, and that the State Department had been working very hard to achieve it. Unfortunately this was a complex and difficult problem. The President interrupted to say, let’s keep pegging at it, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> went on to say that even the sending in of U.S. forces to constitute salvage teams to bring back U.S. military equipment no longer useful in Free Vietnam, had been protested by the British, the French, the Indians, and the Canadians. All of them thought that such a move would constitute a provocation under the terms of the Geneva Armistice Agreement.</p>
<p>Secretary Brucker again pointed out that U.S. equipment to the value of between $50 million and $75 million was going unused in Vietnam. It would be very desirable if we could get this equipment back home through an increase in the size of our <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>. The President asked whether we could not get even the British and Canadians to let us go in and salvage our own military matériel.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> replied by stating his belief that such a move would be possible only if the U.S. personnel sent in to salvage the matériel were civilians. The British strongly objected to any increase in U.S. uniformed personnel in the present circumstances. After further discussion, the President suggested that Secretary Brucker investigate the possibility of salvaging this matériel by recourse to civilian contract arrangements.</p>

<item>1. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> on basis of information available did not consider operation inconsistent with Geneva Agreement, if its purpose was to reduce volume armament.</item>
<item>2. Operations should take place under supervision or with cognizance of <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>, and not outside its jurisdiction. Within this principle, there was precedent for introduction of personnel for limited time and purpose, in that <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> group had entered North Vietnam for short time, after giving notice to <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>.</item>
<item>3. United States Ambassador Saigon should ask French as recipients of armament to notify <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> of term, purposes, number of personnel, approximate dates entry and exit.</item>
<item>4. <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> would perform following functions:
<list>
<item>(a) <hi rend="italic">As to personnel</hi>.</item>
<item>Check on entry and exit.</item>
<item>(b) <hi rend="italic">As to equipment</hi>.</item>
<item><gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> should be notified as to exit dates and inventory of equipment. <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> would have no reason to inspect equipment in exit against inventories, except in case of equipment which was to be replaced.</item></list></item></list>
<p><persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">Desai</persName> noted that Polish member would probably question operation but he repeated there was precedent. He also said Polish might want to check all equipment in exit, but he would be overruled except as to that to be replaced.

<p><gloss target="#t_Dulte1">Dulte</gloss> 29. Eyes only Acting Secretary from Secretary for President.</p>
<p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
<p>I leave Saigon greatly impressed by the immense improvement which has occurred over the past year. The sect armies which seemed to constitute an almost insurmountable obstacle have been almost wholly liquidated and what remains is a mopping-up operation. The elections were healthy and will bring touch of opposition into the open which is good. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has increased self-confidence and his stature has grown. Stubbornness and reluctance to delegate authority still remain, but Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> is free to admit in the past his stubbornness has usually justified itself.</p>
<p>Considerable problems remain as the French complete their withdrawal and the French armistice undertakings are left hanging in the air. Their solution is complicated by continuing distrust and prejudice between the French and Vietnamese, stemming from old colonial relationship. However, I believe I persuaded <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to make a constructive and responsible statement as to his attitude toward the armistice.</p>
<p>This visit with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> repeating my visit of last year has consolidated our personal relations. He feels grateful for the confidence which I expressed in him a year ago which he says helped to carry him through this difficult year.</p>
<p>There is in Vietnam as last year tremendous interest and confidence in you and gratification at your recovery.</p>
<p>Faithfully yours, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster</persName>.</p>

<p>3759. Tokyo <gloss target="#t_USDel1">USDel</gloss><note n="2" xml:id="d314fn2">The reference is to the delegation to the forthcoming meeting of the U.S. Chiefs of Mission in the Far East at Tokyo, March 19–21, under the chairmanship of <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> and attended by <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>. For the text of the communiqué issued after the final session, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, April 2, 1956, pp. 543–544.</note> for Macomber.</p>
<p>1. Secretary had two-hour discussion with President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> March 14, covering many matters. MacArthur, <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Mau</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName><note n="3" xml:id="d314fn3"><persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Nguyen Huu Chau</persName>, Minister of State.</note> also present. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> who seemed confident and reposed gave brief summary of Vietnamese situation in encouraging terms and with expression of great appreciation for U.S. support and assistance. Secretary described highlights <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> meeting, his talks Karachi and visits en route. He suggested discussion of French training mission, Vietnamese attitude toward armistice and <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>, and July election problem.</p>
<p>2. On training, Secretary stressed he had no opinion on solution Franco-Vietnamese military problem, preferring to leave details to technical and military people, but spoke in general on probable need for some French instructors for air and navy services. He said US Government attitude would be to go along with Vietnam on this issue as it seemed raise emotional factors. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> replied Vietnam envisaged retention some French personnel but pointed out French had been delaying negotiations. He said they had indicated they would withdraw all <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> by March and balance military personnel by June. He expressed concern French delay in turning over military buildings, camps, etc., for Vietnamese use. Whenever conversation touched on French, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> launched into bitter criticism of their behavior using many illustrations. In his opinion, retention of French military personnel depends on their changing their “bad attitude”. Secretary informed <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that Pineau said in Karachi French would keep trainers if requested by Vietnam. There was some discussion of problem posed by unprocessed <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> matériel. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> indicated he would accept French and US personnel for this purpose.</p>
<p>3. Armistice question was described by Secretary as most important of issues to be discussed. In order to forestall new Geneva conference, which US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> did not want and to assist British in talks with Russians, he suggested primary concern should be to find formula by which Vietnam could give some indications of practical compliance with armistice. Secretary also pointed out Vietnam had <pb xml:id="pg_660" n="660" facs="0690"/>duty to friends to make known its intentions before co-chairmen talks in London.<note n="4" xml:id="d314fn4">See <ref target="#d309fn2">footnote 2, Document 309</ref>.</note> Later summarizing views of Lloyd and <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>, he urged <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> give sympathetic consideration to something along lines of suggested British declaration.<note n="5" xml:id="d314fn5">In telegram 3612 from Saigon, March 7, the Embassy sent a summary of a suggested declaration which the British wanted <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to make. It was along the following lines: While not bound by the Geneva Agreements, South Vietnam would declare its intention of respecting the existing cease-fire, of cooperating with the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>, of not seeking unification of Vietnam by force but rather looking to the day when conditions in the North would permit genuinely free elections, and of avoiding military alliances or foreign military bases on Vietnam’s soil. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/3–656)</note> <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> stated Vietnam is and would continue in fact to cooperate with <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> to keep the peace and that Vietnam had no intention resort to force; permit establishment foreign bases, or enter military alliances. Secretary cautioned <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> against assuming commitments for indefinite period, pointing out Vietnam might wish to enter <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> later although it not feasible now. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> referred to <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> as a safeguard for Vietnam. He acknowledged correctness of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SSHS1">Stephenson</persName>’s view that a declaration on part Vietnam would facilitate status quo but did not commit himself any further at this point.</p>
<p>4. As to all-Vietnam elections, Secretary stated time would come when it would be useful for Vietnam to take positive stand on principle of free elections. This would entail no danger to Vietnam since free elections could never take place in Communist-dominated territories. Such a declaration by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> on free elections would be helpful to Vietnam and its friends. Secretary cited examples “Germany and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> which had profited by such stands”. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> did not reject suggestion. He stated Viet Minh would never respect results of elections where majority voted for free Vietnam. An index of Viet Minh good faith would be their establishment of enclaves where people in north would be permitted freely to take refuge in order eventually move south.</p>
<p>5. At conclusion <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> brought up necessity increase armed forces and garde civile. He also said assistance would be needed for civic action program. <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName> then cited increasing fiscal requirements and estimated Vietnamese overall needs at about 300–350 hundred million dollars US aid. Secretary suggested this subject be taken up with Embassy.</p>
<p>6. After dinner Secretary emphasized to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> great importance his making declaration on armistice. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> categorically assured Secretary he would make one and that government was working on text which they would discuss with me. Secretary also emphasized to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that Vietnam, though small, had now joined family of nations <pb xml:id="pg_661" n="661" facs="0691"/>and must accept related international responsibilities. Vietnam could exercise much influence in free world.</p>

<p>1. Accompanied <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> when he called on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> March 16. Long conversation during which President reviewed internal and economic situation. Following up his comments to the Secretary on the need to increase the armed forces and garde civile (<gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 3759 March 15, paragraph 5<note n="3" xml:id="d315fn3"><hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note>) <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> referred specifically to the weakness of the navy and his desire to increase the garde civile by 15 to 20,000 (above the 40,000 programmed for fiscal year 1957).</p>
<p>2. In the economic sphere the President emphasized his fear that the Viet Minh would use the increased cost of living to promote strikes that might bring on a vicious spiral of wage increases. Such a development would in turn cause discontent in the armed forces because of their relatively low pay.</p>
<p>3. Regarding proposed declaration on armistice and <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName> had briefed him on conversation with <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> afternoon March 15 (<gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 3767 March 16<note n="4" xml:id="d315fn4">In this telegram <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> reported that he and <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> had discussed with <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName> the language of a possible public declaration by Vietnam on the armistice. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/3–1656)</note>). <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s principal comment was to the effect that Vietnam should not undertake long-term formal commitments and that any declaration would have to be drafted with that in mind. (Note that this is in line with Secretary’s caveat to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>—<gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 3759 paragraph 3.) <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> pointed out problem was a practical rather than juridical one and expressed hope Vietnamese would take the initiative with the French on this. He said that Vietnam’s international standing would be strengthened and the Communists perhaps put on the defensive if the Vietnamese Government would work out a satisfactory formula. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> seemed to accept this point of view, stating that the whole question was a matter of “prudence”.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_662" n="662" facs="0692"/>
<p>4. <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> referred to Secretary’s view on the desirability of a statement regarding Vietnamese support for genuine free elections. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> mentioned that the idea was contained in the suggested declaration. However, he then spent several minutes outlining how such a statement might confuse and upset the people in Vietnam and perhaps lead them to believe the Viet Minh were playing predominant role here. In fact, he seemed cool to the idea of a statement on free elections.</p>
<p>5. It will be recalled that various public bodies, political parties, and the [garble] have recently expressed firm opposition to Geneva agreement (Weekas 10 and 11<note n="5" xml:id="d315fn5">Dated March 10 and 17, neither printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00(W)/3–1056 and 751G.00(W)/3–1756)</note>). This indicates <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> anxious to reassure his countrymen that he is not considering any dealings with the Viet Minh—though French are expanding theirs—before symbolic July date for general elections.</p>

<item>Vietnamese Elections: The Political Campaigns</item>
</list>
<p>In the two despatches under reference the Embassy had discussed the methods used by the Vietnamese Government to bring about the greatest possible public participation in the March 4 elections to the National Assembly, the scope of these activities, and some of their potential effects on the outcome of the voting. This despatch will treat solely with some general aspects of the political campaigns of the candidates and their parties as influenced by the electoral regulations and the implementation thereof.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_663" n="663" facs="0693"/>
<p>The official Election Propaganda Committees described in Embassy despatch No. 306 of March 19 [<hi rend="italic">17</hi>], 1956, which had as their function the execution of the government’s “get out the vote” drive have been confused in foreign press reports with the Candidates’ Campaign Committees, which, as their name indicates, were charged in each constituency with the conduct of the political campaigns of the approximately 405 candidates. Under the provisions of Ordinance 9 of January 23, 1956, these committees were composed of a representative of each political party running candidates and a representative of all independent candidates per district. The committees’ responsibilities included the selection and printing of posters; the determination of places where they might be displayed; the regulation of the number, size, and types of handbills to be distributed; the organization of public meetings; the apportionment of sound truck and radio time where such facilities exist, etc.</p>
<p>In order to insure equal treatment for all candidates, the electoral laws forbade the use of private funds or materials and provided instead that campaign expenses should be paid out of the national budget on the basis of one piaster per voter. While this appears to have been an honest attempt to insure fairness, the result was that the apportionment of funds (i.e., materials) was completely divorced from any relationship to the amount of campaigning that needed to be done or the size of the opposition to overcome, for it is obvious that in two constituencies of equal size a candidate with only one opponent would receive five times as much in the way of supplies as one opposed by nine others. Since the average number of contenders per district was somewhat larger in Saigon than elsewhere, the per capita expenditure per candidate was also lower and ranged from a low of .083 piasters (U.S. $0.0237) in Ward 6 (45,902 voters, 12 candidates) to a high of .25 piasters (U.S. $0.0714) in Ward 5 (36,614 voters, 4 candidates).</p>
<p>It must be admitted, however, that the electoral laws did remove almost all question of private means from the campaigns. Furthermore, since the required deposit of 2,000 P would be forfeited only by those who received less than 5% of the votes cast in their district, the element of financial risk was quite small.</p>
<p>By American standards the campaigns themselves were exceedingly dull. Slated to begin on February 20 for a twelve day period, no activity was noticeable in Saigon until February 25, although the local press had carried a few pictures and biographic notices before that date. Even during the few days that marked the peak of political activities, the most visible and audible signs that an election was about to take place were those which constituted part of the government’s propaganda drive (Embassy’s despatch 306 of March 17). Such attempts as there were by candidates to make themselves seen or <pb xml:id="pg_664" n="664" facs="0694"/>heard seemed by comparison to be unimportant, and the public remained largely uninterested. The political campaigns themselves consisted of the display of posters; the distribution of handbills; publication of pictures, biographies, and programs of action, if any, in the newspapers; attendance and talks at meetings; personal house to house calls; and a limited number of radio speeches. Forbidden were entertainments, promises, favors such as transportation on election day, threats, bribery, and coercion.</p>
<p>Although the campaign regulations as set forth in the electoral laws claimed a basis of complete equality for all candidates, in actual practice those who were unofficially favored by the Vietnamese government, its party, the National Revolutionary Movement, or any of the latter’s affiliates, had many advantages. For example, when it came to the printing and distribution of posters and documents, a candidate whom the government or the <gloss target="#t_NRM1">NRM</gloss> did not want to win might find that his posters were the last to be printed and therefore might not be available until just before the election. Or, once posted, they might be torn down by “goon squads”, as occasionally happened. As will be seen below, there were other ways by which special advantages went to preferred individuals.</p>
<p>The use of press facilities for the exposition of platforms, etc., was not covered in the electoral ordinances, and they were by no means shared equally. It is estimated that of the 400-odd candidates, less than 100 received any mention at all—incidental, derogatory, or otherwise, and the number of those who actually had their pictures, programs, and biographies printed probably did not exceed 50. Of this number the most prominent figures, i.e., Mr. and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName>; [name and title deleted]; Delegate for South Vietnam Tran Van Lam; Secretary of Youth and Information Tran Chanh Thanh, etc., appeared repeatedly in most papers.</p>
<p>Press treatment of the political campaigns was allegedly facilitated by the suspension on February 20 of censorship controls over the Vietnamese press then in existence. However, this relaxation was more than counteracted by the signature of a new decree that same day providing heavy penalties for the “distribution or reproduction by any means whatsoever of tendentious news or commentaries favorable to communist or anti-national activities”. Being more invidious, the new law was effective in making journalists much more careful about what they printed than had been the case under censorship, where responsibility for the deletion of contentious points rested with the censors. It is little surprising, then, that the role of the press in the electoral campaigns was a noncontroversial one.</p>
<p>Like the newspaper columns, public rallies were used to bring candidates before their constituencies. At such meetings all candidates were assembled together and each in turn was given an opportunity <pb xml:id="pg_665" n="665" facs="0695"/>to outline “his biography, his political past, and his course of action” and to answer such questions as might be posed. In many cases the speakers took occasion to praise their opponents, especially if they included a well known figure, and all candidates were dutifully and politely applauded. As an example of the effectiveness of such gatherings might be cited one that took place in Saigon, where, before an audience composed almost entirely of government workers, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Nguyen Huu Chau</persName>, Secretary of State at the Presidency, spoke for some forty-five minutes—longer than all other speakers combined. In the next day’s official <hi rend="italic">Vietnam Presse</hi> he received a page and a half as against the brief paragraph allotted all his opponents.</p>
<p>Radio (in the form of the Vietnamese National Broadcasting Company) was also used as a campaign medium, but the limited facilities permitted only a small number of candidates to make use of them. Sound trucks and public address devices were also sometimes available, but most of them were taken up by the Ministry of Information’s own election-boosting efforts.</p>
<p>The only field left to individual initiative and energy was “door-bell ringing”. So long as one did not violate the electoral regulations, he or his supporters could visit as many households and talk to as many voters as desired.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> From the foregoing it will be seen that the recently concluded political campaigns in Vietnam were quite unfamiliar to observers acquainted with current American practices. It is equally clear that the effect of the regulations on the campaigns was to reduce the importance of individual efforts. The brief campaign period, further curtailed by a late start, the unrealistic basis for the apportionment of funds and materials, the restrictions on personal activities, and the limited public forums available all tended to decrease the effect of each personal campaign and to give an advantage to well known candidates or to those with an organized political following. All of this, of course, at the expense of really independent or relatively unknown contenders.</p>
<p>This effect was heightened by the mildness of the campaigns themselves. Despite the fact that the elections were for a Constituent Assembly, the forthcoming constitution was rarely mentioned. In an atmosphere of almost complete lack of issues, platforms varied from wholehearted support of the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> Government to no platform at all, as was the case in one Saigon district where the individual confessed that he was only running because his friends persuaded him to. Indeed, a large number of candidates filed for office in order to withdraw at the last minute and throw their support to a colleague. Most programs were almost completely and mutually identical in major points: anti-communist; anti-colonialist; and pro-<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. Candidates promised to work for the good of the country, for national reconstruction, <pb xml:id="pg_666" n="666" facs="0696"/>for democracy, etc. (See Embassy despatch 284 of March 1.<note n="3" xml:id="d316fn3">Cited <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.</note>) Had any possible contentious points been contained in the programs submitted to the campaign committees, it is probable that either the authors would have been disqualified or the undesirable points deleted. The lack of issues prevented unwanted criticism of official policies or prominent figures, i.e., government officials or those close to the official family, and thereby limited the stature of their opponents.</p>
<p>Considering, then, the care with which candidates were screened in the first place (Embassy despatch No. 285 of March 1<note n="4" xml:id="d316fn4">Cited <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.</note>) and the campaign regulations and procedures that tended to favor those most closely associated with or in the favor of the government and its political organizations, it is not surprising that a substantial majority of well known <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> supporters was elected to the National Assembly.</p>

After your talk with <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> on <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss>,<note n="2" xml:id="d317fn2">See <ref target="#d311">Document 311</ref>.</note> the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> informed our Delhi Embassy<note n="3" xml:id="d317fn3">See <ref target="#d312">Document 312</ref>.</note> that on the basis of the information they had available they would not consider our proposed operation inconsistent with the Geneva Agreement if its purpose was to reduce the volume of armament in South Viet-Nam.</p>
<p>2. The <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> indicated that the operation should take place under supervision or with the cognizance of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>. We should have the <pb xml:id="pg_667" n="667" facs="0697"/>French (as liaison with the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>) notify <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> of the dates of entry and exit of personnel and of the exit dates and inventory of equipment; <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> would then exercise the necessary controls. Within this principle, there was precedent for the introduction of personnel for a limited time and purpose, in that a Communist Chinese group had entered North Viet-Nam for a short time after giving notice to the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>.</p>
<p>3. The Department and the Embassy at Saigon consider the initial Indian reaction far more flexible than anticipated. The Department believes that if the establishment of <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> satisfies the minimum personnel objectives of our Defense Department in Viet-Nam, the notification and supervisory procedures indicated by the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> may be acceptable, even though our compliance might establish a present practical ceiling for <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> (350). Our compliance would also almost certainly have the effect of encouraging <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> to insist on receiving notification of the movements of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> as well as <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> personnel. In this respect, we have already indicated to the French and Canadians that we have no objections to the French and/or Vietnamese notifying the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> of the entry and exit of U.S. <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> personnel on the basis of information available to them from their own resources.</p>
<p>4. The Defense Department’s understanding is that the function of <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> pertains both to supervising recovery and outshipment of excess <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> equipment and to assistance in improvement of Vietnamese logistical capabilities so as to preserve the equipment now in the hands of Viet-Nam aimed forces. Subject to this understanding, and assuming the retention in Viet-Nam of 1,000 French military technicians for equipment redistribution and of certain French naval and air training and maintenance personnel, the establishment of <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> would satisfy the Defense minimum personnel objectives for Viet-Nam, at least for the immediate future. Under those circumstances Defense would agree with State that <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> notification and supervisory procedures would be acceptable for <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> personnel.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendations</p>
<p>1. a. That we provide the Government of India with any additional information on <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> that may be required and continue to request their support for the operation.</p>
<p>b. That we inform the Government of India that we will authorize the French and/or Vietnamese to supply the required notifications to the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and that we will cooperate in supplying relevant information.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_668" n="668" facs="0698"/>
<p>2. That you approve the despatch of a “Temporary Equipment Recovery Mission” in uniform<note n="4" xml:id="d317fn4"><persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> in his own hand deleted the words “in uniform” and wrote in the substitute language, “in civilian clothes”.</note> to Viet-Nam under the understanding described in para 4 above, and that you authorize us to notify the Defense Department immediately to that effect.</p>
<p>3. That we inform the French, Canadian, British and Vietnamese governments of our decision to proceed, expose the Indian government’s point of view fully to these governments, and continue to request their support.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Problem of Vietnamese Armistice Declaration</item>
</list>
<p>1. The Vietnamese Government on April 3 delivered to the British Ambassador in Saigon a letter addressed to the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Foreign Secretary containing the text of the Vietnamese policy statement on the question of armistice responsibilities on which the Vietnamese, in consultation with the British and ourselves, had been working for several weeks. A copy of the Vietnamese letter to the British is attached for your information (Tab A).<note n="2" xml:id="d318fn2">For text of this letter, April 3, which was not attached to the source text, see Cameron, <hi rend="italic">Viet-Nam Crisis</hi>, vol. I, pp. 425–426. On April 6, the Republic of Vietnam made public a declaration in terms almost identical to this letter of April 3.</note></p>
<p>2. Our Ambassador and the British Ambassador consider the Vietnamese text the maximum obtainable and have consequently given it their full support. The text is being transmitted in the form of a Vietnamese answer to a warning message of the Geneva co-Chairmen on the subject of armistice responsibilities which was transmitted to the Geneva powers and the supervisory powers in Viet-Nam on December 21, 1955.<note n="3" xml:id="d318fn3">For text of this message, actually dated December 20, see <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> pp. 414–415.</note> The British will probably circulate the text <pb xml:id="pg_669" n="669" facs="0699"/>to the Geneva powers and the supervisory powers as soon as possible.</p>
<p>3. The Soviets have now formally responded to the March 9 British suggestion to the Soviets that in place of holding a new Geneva conference at this time, the Geneva co-Chairmen meet in London during the visit of the Soviet leaders in mid-April.<note n="4" xml:id="d318fn4">For a report of these meetings of the Geneva cochairmen, see <ref target="#d324">Document 324</ref>.</note> The Soviet answer stresses the need for full implementation of the Geneva Agreements, including nation-wide elections, and suggests advantage be taken of <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s presence in London to hold an earlier meeting of the co-Chairmen with a view to expediting an early convocation of a meeting of the Geneva powers.</p>
<p>4. The British may tell the Soviets that they are agreeable to an early meeting, perhaps in the second week in April. They are relying upon the text of the Vietnamese policy statement to make the best possible case in talking to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>.</p>
<p>5. The British Foreign Office has not yet informed us of its attitude: a) on the merits of the Vietnamese statement, and b) on a later convocation of a new Geneva conference if the Soviets insist on such a meeting.</p>

<p>3430. Joint State/Defense Message for Embassy and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>. Department’s 3362, 3375, 3388 to Saigon;<note n="2" xml:id="d319fn2">These telegrams, April 5, 6, and 7, contained preliminary thinking and instructions by the Departments of State and Defense on <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> approval of the mission. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.5–MSP/4–256, 751G.5–MSP/4–656, and 751G.00/4–656, respectively)</note> Saigon’s 4057, 4058, 4077, 4096.<note n="3" xml:id="d319fn3">These telegrams, April 6, 6, 7, and 9, contained the Embassy’s views and comments on <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> approval of the mission. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.5–MSP/4–656, 751G.00/4–656, 751G.00/4–756, and 751G.5–MSP/4–956, respectively)</note> Details State/Defense understanding <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> and related problems <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> as follows:</p>
<p>1. A Temporary Equipment Recovery Mission of 350 American military personnel is created for the purpose both of supervising the <pb xml:id="pg_670" n="670" facs="0700"/>recovery and outshipment of excess <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> equipment in Viet-Nam and of assisting in the improvement of Vietnamese logistical capabilities so as to preserve equipment in the hands of Viet-Nam Armed forces (Department’s 2790 to Saigon<note n="4" xml:id="d319fn4">See <ref target="#d304fn3">footnote 3, Document 304</ref>.</note>). The estimated time period for the operation is 12 months and the operation will be restudied by our two Departments prior to expiration of that time. <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> personnel are also to work in conjunction with French military technical personnel completing French obligations under the <persName corresp="#p_EGPHR1">Ely</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> Agreement in respect to <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> matériel in Viet-Nam and with any foreign civilian technicians that may be hired by the Government of Viet-Nam for the purposes stated above.</p>
<p>2. In view desirability requesting formal Commission approval for <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> operation, State and Defense have agreed delay <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> arrivals until May 9, 1956, thus leaving what appears to us reasonable time for Commission consideration.</p>
<p>3. Defense fully aware necessity keeping <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> organizations separate insofar as possible. Personnel orders for incoming <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> personnel will therefore be labelled specifically for <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> and a specific officer will be selected to head <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> under command of Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>.</p>
<p>4. State has, however, concurred in Defense plan to transfer personnel from <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> to <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> to extent required for maximum efficiency of its operations Viet-Nam, and it is consequently probable that some of new personnel arrivals will be assigned <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> after arrival, with concurrent transfer certain present <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> personnel to <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss>.</p>
<p>5. State and Defense agree that <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> notification procedure for both <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> personnel should be kept to minimum required as decided by Ambassador after consultation with Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>. U.S. certainly would not countenance Commission control of U.S. military activities Viet-Nam once personnel are on the spot.</p>
<p>6. In regard to <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> notification procedure Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> will be responsible for supplying to Embassy with minimum delay arrival and departure information all U.S. military personnel Viet-Nam, as well as required information re outshipment and arrival matériel and equipment. Embassy will then informally provide this information to French or Vietnamese for transmission to Commission.</p>
<p>7. Insofar as practicable, commercial aircraft will be used for new personnel arrivals in Viet-Nam. Whenever <gloss target="#t_MATS1">MATS</gloss> is used, prior notification or <gloss target="#t_MATS1">MATS</gloss> arrivals will be given Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and Chief <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> for info Embassy whenever possible.</p>
<p>8. New military personnel will arrive in increments staggered over approximately 120 days. Full staffing <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> as described <pb xml:id="pg_671" n="671" facs="0701"/>para 12 below will not be achieved until sometime in August 1956.</p>
<p>9. In regard to clothing of military personnel, discretion is being left to Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, Chief <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss>, and Ambassador as indicated Department’s 3362 to Saigon.<note n="5" xml:id="d319fn5">This telegram, cited in <ref target="#d319fn2">footnote 2</ref> above, reads in part: “Question uniforms for <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> personnel to be handled as follows. Since Defense Department poses strongest objections to restrictions requiring <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> personnel to wear civilian clothing, Chief <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> will determine conditions under which uniforms or civilian clothing are to be worn. In recognition of political and psychological factors involved, and after consultation with American Ambassador, Chief <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> will to extent practicable direct <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> personnel to wear civilian clothing when off duty and on other occasions as appropriate.”</note></p>
<p>10. Funds and personnel for support <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> operation will be provided by Department of Defense.</p>
<p>11. No publicity will be given <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> operation in Washington or in field at this time. If knowledge of operation becomes public in Viet-Nam, U.S. Ambassador authorized to make such public statement as he and Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> deem necessary.</p>
<p>12. Problem of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> excess. Defense Department has agreed limit <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> to 350 personnel and comply with required <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> notification procedures on understanding that establishment <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> will satisfy its minimum personnel requirement Viet-Nam (Department’s 3323 to Saigon<note n="6" xml:id="d319fn6">Dated April 2, not printed. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/3–2856)</note>). This requirement is 740 personnel including both <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss>. State and Defense agree that ceiling figures given Commission should be 342 and 350 respectively. Seems reasonable that gap of 48 personnel be considered excess for both groups to cover number personnel normally on leave, medical, travel status, etc., outside Viet-Nam. State has therefore authorized Defense to assign total of 740 military personnel to Viet-Nam with understanding there will not be actually more than 692 personnel physically present in Viet-Nam at any one time, including <gloss target="#t_TDY1">TDY</gloss>’s, but excluding overlaps.</p>

<p rend="center">DEFENSE INFORMATION RELATING TO THE U.S. AID PROGRAM FOR VIETNAM</p>
<p>1. In a memorandum for the Secretary of Defense, dated 25 February 1955, subject: “Objectives for the Department of Defense International Security Plan”,<note n="2" xml:id="d320fn2">Not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> CCS 381 U.S. (1–31–50))</note> the Joint Chiefs of Staff submitted the following major U.S. military objectives for Vietnam:</p>
<list>
<item>a. To assist Free Vietnam, as appropriate, to maintain military forces necessary for internal security and capable of providing some resistance to external aggression.</item>
<item>b. Promote eventual participation by Free Vietnam in the Manila Pact (<gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>).</item>
</list>
<p>2. From the foregoing military objectives, the following missions for the Vietnamese armed forces have been derived:</p>
<list>
<item>a. To assist in the maintenance of internal security.</item>
<item>b. To resist external aggression.</item>
<item>c. To assist in regional defense with other non-Communist countries.</item>
</list>
<p>3. The Vietnamese force objectives to achieve a minimum capability to accomplish the above objectives and missions, as previously recommended by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in a memorandum for the Secretary of Defense, dated 4 January 1956, subject: “Modification of <gloss target="#t_MDA1">MDA</gloss> Programming Guidance for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957”,<note n="3" xml:id="d320fn3">Not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> CCS 092 (8–22–46) (2))</note> are still valid.</p>
<p>4. The Joint Chiefs of Staff agree with the assessment of the capability of Vietnamese forces and the report on the current status of existing Vietnamese forces by the Military Assistance Advisory Group, Vietnam, dated 15 January 1956, subject: “Country Statement on <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss>, Non-<gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Countries.”<note n="4" xml:id="d320fn4">Not found.</note></p>
<p>5. In view of the sensitive nature of the information quoted or referenced above, it is recommended that the following be used as a basis for the Department of Defense submission on Vietnam:</p>
<list>
<item>a. <hi rend="italic">Force objectives:</hi> Army, 4 infantry divisions and 4 territorial divisions; Navy, 7 landing ships and 5 patrol craft; Air Force, 5 squadrons.</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_673" n="673" facs="0703"/>
<item>b. <hi rend="italic">Force missions:</hi> As stated in paragraph 2 above.</item>
<item>c. <hi rend="italic">Justification:</hi> The Vietnamese force objectives are the optimum forces that the Vietnamese can presently raise and maintain with available U.S. aid. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that these forces are the minimum acceptable for the assigned missions. These force levels are based on U.S. aid available and force requirements and are justified by the inclusion of Vietnam in the “Protocol to the South-east Asia Collective Defense Treaty.”</item>
<item>d. <hi rend="italic">Forces in being:</hi>
<list>
<item>(1) <hi rend="italic">Army</hi>—4 field divisions, 6 light divisions, non-divisional infantry, and supporting units.</item>
<item>(2) <hi rend="italic">Navy</hi>—4 Dinaussaut units, each consisting of a support landing ship (large) (<gloss target="#t_LSSL1">LSSL</gloss>) or infantry landing ship (large) (<gloss target="#t_LSIL1">LSIL</gloss>) as a ‘mother’ ship with 6 or 7 medium landing craft (<gloss target="#t_LCM1">LCM</gloss>) and landing craft vehicle personnel (<gloss target="#t_LCVP1">LCVP</gloss>); and 1 marine battalion.</item>
<item>(3) <hi rend="italic">Air Force</hi>—1 liaison squadron and 1 transport squadron.</item></list></item>
<item>e. <hi rend="italic">Effectiveness of Forces in being:</hi>
<list>
<item>(1) <hi rend="italic">General.</hi> All three of the Vietnamese Services lack adequate experienced command and staff officers, and urgently need additional training; they are incapable of autonomous logistic supply and maintenance activities, even assuming adequate supply of necessary material by the U.S. These inadequacies are even more pronounced in the Navy and Air Force than in the Army.</item>
<item>(2) <hi rend="italic">Army</hi>. The Vietnamese Army is currently capable of establishing and maintaining internal security against bandit and dissident elements, excluding organized all-out activity by Viet Minh elements acting under centralized direction of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This capability does not preclude minor isolated attacks by dissidents and bandits. In event of organized full-scale guerrilla and subversive activity by “planted” Viet Minh elements, control of relatively large undeveloped areas of Free Vietnam would likely pass to the Viet Minh. In event of full scale Viet Minh invasion, Vietnamese army forces would not be capable, at this time, of reacting with sufficient speed and effectiveness to utilize the natural defensive terrain north of Tourane. Assuming logistic support requirements will not allow fast uninterrupted Viet Minh movement southward, the assistance provided by terrain and distance would enable Vietnamese forces to retain general control of the “heartland” area of Free Vietnam south of the line Ban Me Thuot–Nha Trang for the first 60 days of hostilities, provided this “heartland” area did not itself collapse due to internal conditions.</item>
<item>(3) <hi rend="italic">Navy</hi>. The Vietnamese Navy has demonstrated a capability to participate effectively in limited amphibious operations and to provide limited surveillance of its coast and waterways. It is incapable of fulfilling a mission of coastal patrol and of providing its own logistic support.</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_674" n="674" facs="0704"/>
<item>(4) <hi rend="italic">Air Force</hi>. The capability of the Vietnamese Air Force to fulfill its mission to provide air support for the Vietnamese Army, including liaison, reconnaissance, and limited ground-fire support and air transportation of personnel and supplies, is very limited.

<dateline><hi rend="italic"><placeName>Washington</placeName>, <date when="1956-05-01">May 1, 1956</date></hi>.</dateline>
<p>Dear Mr. Secretary: I refer both to your letter to the Secretary dated December 13, 1955,<note n="2" xml:id="d321fn2">See <ref target="#d287fn3">footnote 3, Document 287</ref>.</note> on the subject of dispatching additional military training personnel to Viet-Nam and to your letter to the Secretary dated January 31, 1956,<note n="3" xml:id="d321fn3"><ref target="#d295">Document 295</ref>.</note> bearing more specifically on the problem of recovering and maintaining <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss>-origin equipment in Viet-Nam.</p>
<p>As you are aware, our two Departments have been studying and discussing these related problems for several months. On February 25, 1956, during these discussions, the Department of State initiated negotiations with other governments principally concerned with a view to obtaining their acquiescence to our joint project of sending a Temporary Equipment Mission to Viet-Nam. These negotiations have now been favorably completed, leaving only the formal approval of the International Control Commission in Viet-Nam still to be obtained. We are now seeking this approval which we hope can be given in time for the first <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> elements to arrive in Saigon on May 9, the date mutually agreed upon for initial arrivals.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, with our concurrence your Department has begun implementation of this project. Accordingly, it may be appropriate for me to elaborate the State Department’s understanding of certain aspects of the <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> operation which are only briefly alluded to in the Joint State/Defense message to Saigon numbered State 3430, dated April 12, 1956,<note n="4" xml:id="d321fn4"><ref target="#d319">Document 319</ref>.</note> in which you concurred.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_675" n="675" facs="0705"/>
<p>1. It is our understanding that the <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> operation has the double purpose of (a) supervising the recovery (identification, inventory, and accounting control) and outshipment of excess <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> equipment; and (b) of assisting in the improvement of Vietnamese logistical capabilities.</p>
<p>The <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> operation was originally conceived to implement the decision of the Secretary of State, dated February 3, 1956, to explore with other governments concerned the possibility of sending additional military personnel to Viet-Nam to assist in the recovery of our equipment. It has been understood between our two Departments from the beginning of discussions on that problem that if significant amounts of this equipment are inventoried, much of it, including equipment nominally turned over to the Vietnamese forces, will be shipped out of Vietnam. It is on the basis of this understanding that the Department of State obtained the acquiescence of other governments concerned, the rationale for their acceptance being that the <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> operation will not contribute to the growth of the military potential in the zone south of the 17th parallel.</p>
<p>While it is understood, therefore, that <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> personnel will perform certain functions of training which are inseparable from their tasks of recovering and maintaining United States-origin equipment in Viet-Nam, such functions of training should in no case be allowed to become the single or even the primary duty of <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> (as distinguished from <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>) personnel. Moreover, a substantial quantity of the equipment recovered in Viet-Nam should be shipped out of the country, so as to implement in good faith the promises made to other governments whose benevolent acquiescence to the operation we have obtained.</p>
<p>2. In regard to the clothing of the military personnel involved, and as indicated in our joint message of April 12, 1956, to Saigon this question is being left to the discretion of Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, Chief <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss>, and the American Ambassador at Saigon. However, I wish to indicate again our very strong desire that owing to the political and psychological factors involved, civilian clothing be used whenever possible by <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> personnel upon their arrival in and departure from Viet-Nam, as well as during their period of assignment in the country.</p>
<p>3. With respect to administrative support services for <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss>, it is our understanding that the appropriate personnel and funds will be provided by the Department of Defense for the full administrative backstopping of the group. In this connection, it has been our view for some time now that steps should be taken to have the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> mission administratively supported by military personnel. The Embassy at Saigon has had increasing difficulty over the past several years in performing adequate support services for the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>. We <pb xml:id="pg_676" n="676" facs="0706"/>feel that since your Department will now establish a complete administrative unit for <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss>, it would be appropriate to consider the transfer of all support arrangements for <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> from the Embassy’s jurisdiction as soon as practicable. I understand that the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> mission in Saigon has given considerable thought to this proposition in the last several months and I would like to urge that the appropriate administrative units of our two Departments begin formulating definite plans for such a transfer.</p>
<p>I shall appreciate your views as soon as it is convenient and hope that you will concur in the points expressed above. A copy of this letter is being sent to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>, Director, Central Intelligence Agency, Washington, and to the American Ambassador to Saigon.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 3. Subject: Bilateral talks May 2 with French: Far East.</p>
<p>1. Pineau opened by saying that French were firmly against reconvening Geneva conference on Indochina as it would serve no point with US and Vietnam absent. He said France was willing maintain her responsibilities under armistice agreement on an ad hoc basis provided it proved possible work out some agreement with Vietnamese for them to share in this responsibility.</p>
<p>2. Pineau then mentioned military negotiations with Vietnamese. He said French were very desirous maintaining Seno base and pointed out importance of this base in strengthening position of Lao Government. To maintain this base it would be necessary have transit and docking facilities Saigon. In practice this would mean maintenance of naval arsenal at Saigon so that there would be facilities available to repair and provision French ships. Pineau said French had made suggestion along this line to Vietnamese 2 weeks ago and had not yet received any reply.</p>
<p>3. Pineau said <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> had assembled the French officers who had been working for <gloss target="#t_TRIM1">TRIM</gloss> and had told them that since <pb xml:id="pg_677" n="677" facs="0707"/><gloss target="#t_TRIM1">TRIM</gloss> was going out of existence as of April 28, their services were no longer required and that they should leave promptly.<note n="2" xml:id="d322fn2"><persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName> denied this according to telegram 4395 from Saigon, May 5. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.5/5–556)</note> Pineau said that this might have been technically correct but he did not think it had been a very tactful way to handle this matter. Pineau then raised the question of command and said that US was insisting on an overall US command that would prevent direct access by French naval and air training elements to Vietnamese Government. He said French felt this was not acceptable and that what he wished was a small French element in a joint staff. He did not seem to question at all propriety of a preponderance of US influence in such a staff but felt strongly French should have some representation on it. The Secretary replied he was not familiar with either of these two subjects. Would promptly ask for information from Washington. (Information contained Saigon 4351 repeated Paris 696<note n="3" xml:id="d322fn3">In this telegram, May 1, the Embassy reported that <persName corresp="#p_HH1">Hoppenot</persName> and his staff were unhappy with a U.S. proposal that <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName> become overall coordinator of military training in Vietnam. The Embassy staff believed it was a matter of prestige to the French and planned to suggest informally to the French that they consider a Franco-American-Vietnamese liaison group chaired by <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName>. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.5–MSP/5–156)</note> had not yet reached French.)</p>
<p>4. North Vietnam. Pineau said there had been no change in situation and French had no intention having diplomatic relations with North Vietnam. They planned continue their economic and cultural mission as in past, and had offered Viet Minh right to have similar mission Paris. This offer had not as yet been accepted by Viet Minh. Secretary said commercial mission risked assuming diplomatic character.</p>
<p>5. Cambodia. Pineau expressed pleasure our recent letter regarding aid for Cambodia. He said French heartily approved our action in assisting Cambodia and hoped we would continue on our present course. He said that while great patience was required in dealing with Cambodians, they were fundamentally friendly.</p>
<p>In closing Pineau stressed that the 2 really important matters were the Saigon naval arsenal and the command problem.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 32. Following is summary of Tripartite Ministers discussion on Far East May 6:</p>
<p>Pineau opened by saying main problem from French viewpoint is that resulting from abolition of French High Command.<note n="2" xml:id="d323fn2">The French High Command in Indochina had been officially dissolved on April 28</note> French placed in difficult position as result of their responsibilities under Geneva Agreement. They were pleased with proposals worked out in London to have co-chairmen of Geneva Conference meet and make proposals to French Government to enable it to discharge its responsibilities.<note n="3" xml:id="d323fn3">For a report of the meetings of the Geneva cochairmen in London, see <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</note> He expressed gratitude to <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> for its efforts in this regard. He said that French Government had received numerous requests from North Vietnam for international conference. It had answered that conference useless in view of South Vietnam and U.S. unwillingness to attend. He thought there should be common viewpoint on this matter.</p>
<p>Pineau said that proposed solution to be communicated French Government (of which however it had not yet received official text) involved one problem. Application of military clauses and political clauses were not clearly distinguished, which might cause trouble with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> whose cooperation was essential. He thought instructions to <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> representative (<persName corresp="#p_SSHS1">Stephenson</persName>) should deal with this point on basis to be worked out by mutual agreement. He asked Secretary’s views on willingness of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to cooperate with respect to <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>.</p>
<p>Secretary said that he was not up to date on situation. When he stopped at Saigon after Karachi meeting a month ago, statement to be made by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had been worked out which had been practically agreed. In effect, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would have agreed to give effect to military clauses of armistice agreement and to protect <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>. He did not know what had happened subsequently to this proposal.</p>
<p>Lloyd said he believed considerable progress had been made in London discussion. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> seemed disposed to abandon idea of international conference. He thought effect of proposed statement was to give <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> benefit of armistice agreement without assuming responsibilities. He had been surprised at moderate reaction of Krishna Menon. Indians would apparently be satisfied with statement that there would be discussion of elections by July, 1957. He <pb xml:id="pg_679" n="679" facs="0709"/>thought it desirable to persuade <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to do something with respect to political aspects. He did not think it was in our interest to have military armistice system break down, which would happen if <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> had to leave, and to have hostilities resumed.</p>
<p>The Secretary said U.S. was in agreement with this thought. Only recent information he had, which he believed British and French knew, related to operation of military mission to deal with equipment turned over by French to Vietnam Government. He had discussed this with <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> at New Delhi and had obtained <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>’s agreement to dispatch of mission. However several days ago Indian representative on <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> had withheld consent on grounds position of <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> was not sufficiently clear. This was disturbing development. Mission was on Pacific coast and ready to depart. He did not know how long its departure could be held up. He understood that there was no objection to sending mission, which had been agreed to by <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>. Difficulty was lack of clarity as to authority of commission to approve or disapprove its activities.</p>
<p>Secretary said there was one additional point which he had discussed with Pineau on May 3, which related to the command arrangements affecting French training mission. He was informed that agreement had been reached between <persName corresp="#p_HH1">Hoppenot</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> in Saigon, and it was hoped to obtain <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s agreement to arrangements on Tuesday.<note n="4" xml:id="d323fn4">May 8.</note></p>
<p>Pineau said he thought there was general interest in French maintaining base in Indo China. This was only base they had, which it would be foolish to abandon since it was only one permitted under armistice agreement. However, logistic support was required which he thought was reconcilable with requirements of training mission.</p>
<p>Secretary said he had not spoken of this point but of command arrangements which he understood had been agreed. Pineau said this was also his understanding.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Results of the London Co-Chairmen Talks on Viet-Nam.</item>
</list>
<p>1. At the conclusion of their meetings on Vietnam, the co-chairmen sent out three important messages which, in effect, will serve as supplements to the Geneva agreements on Viet-Nam. Messages went to: (1) the Vietnamese and Viet Minh Governments; (2) the International Control Commission (<gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>); and (3) the French Government. All three messages stress: (a) the need fully to implement the Geneva Agreements, including the political provisions, (b) the hope of the Co-Chairmen that the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> will continue to supervise the armistice in Viet-Nam on the basis of the Geneva Agreements, and (c) the belief of the Co-Chairmen that present difficulties, including some very vexing legal problems, can be resolved in practice through the cooperation of both Vietnamese Governments with the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> in the implementation of the Geneva Agreements.</p>
<p>2. In their message to the Republic of Viet-Nam and to the Viet Minh (Tab A)<note n="2" xml:id="d324fn2">For text, see Cameron, <hi rend="italic">Viet-Nam Crisis</hi>, vol. I, pp. 432–433.</note> the Co-Chairmen express their concern that consultations for elections have not yet begun although both sides have accepted the principle of reunification by free elections. They strongly urge both governments to make every effort to implement the Geneva Agreements and <hi rend="italic">invite them to transmit to the Co-Chairmen as soon as possible, jointly or separately, their views on the time required for the opening of electoral consultations and the holding of elections</hi>. The Co-Chairmen state that they will continue to consult about the situation in Viet-Nam and if necessary will discuss measures to insure the fulfillment of the Geneva Agreements including the proposal to convene a new Geneva conference.</p>
<p>3. In their message to the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> (Tab B),<note n="3" xml:id="d324fn3">For text, see <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>. ,pp. 434–435.</note> the Co-Chairmen stress the importance of maintaining the cease-fire under continued supervision of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> pending the holding of elections for reunification in Viet-Nam. If the commission encounters obstacles or difficulties that cannot be resolved on the spot, it is so to inform the Co-Chairmen who may then consider measures to facilitate the work of the commission.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_681" n="681" facs="0711"/>
<p>4. In their message to the French Government (Tab C),<note n="4" xml:id="d324fn4">For text, see <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> pp. 435–436.</note> the Co-Chairmen state their belief that the continued good offices of the French Government (as liaison with the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and with the Joint Armistice Commission) could be very valuable while present difficulties are being resolved, and invite the French Government to discuss this question with the Vietnamese authorities. The Co-Chairmen ask that until some new arrangement is put into effect the French Government preserve the status quo (by continuing its present liaison functions with <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_JAC1">JAC</gloss>).</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Comments</p>
<p>1. As a result of these messages, the Soviet Union and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> as Geneva Co-Chairmen emerge as the institutionalized arbiters of the implementation of the Geneva Agreements in Viet-Nam.</p>
<p>2. Viewed from the vantage point of mid-1954, the West can be considered to have gained a considerable diplomatic victory in that more time has been gained to strengthen South Viet-Nam, the armistice is being preserved, and no elections will be held in 1956. At the same time, no date has been set for such elections or for the opening of electoral consultations between the two zones.</p>
<p>3. Similarly, from the vantage point of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, engaged in a relatively difficult negotiation with the Soviets, the outcome of the talks is favorable in that the immediate danger of a new Geneva conference has been averted.</p>
<p>4. However, from the vantage point of the Vietnamese Government and of our more recent hopes as to the future in Viet-Nam, the messages have several unfortunate aspects.</p>
<list>
<item>(a) Though they suggest that present difficulties can be resolved in practice, they do not mention the April 6 Vietnamese declaration of cooperation with the armistice and with the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>,<note n="5" xml:id="d324fn5">See <ref target="#d318">Document 318</ref>.</note> and they continue to stress the implementation of the old Geneva Agreements to which Viet-Nam refuses to be bound;</item>
<item>(b) The Commission is under a stronger mandate now than it was before to see to the implementation of the Geneva political provisions (elections);</item>
<item>(c) The stress on the elections and the request to transmit to the Co-Chairmen an estimate of the time required in this regard will probably prove highly unpalatable to the Vietnamese Government;</item>
<item>(d) The Vietnamese are unlikely to agree for long to a continuing; liaison role by the French with the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and the Joint Armistice Commission and are equally unlikely ever to accept legal succession to French obligations under the Geneva Agreements.</item>
</list>
<pb xml:id="pg_682" n="682" facs="0712"/>
<p>5. From the standpoint of Communist intentions, the Co-Chairmen talks reveal that, while the Russians are probably not anxious to see a crisis precipitated in Viet-Nam over the Geneva Agreements, they nonetheless are by no means abandoning their support of the Chinese Communists and the Viet Minh in regard to Viet-Nam. Nor are the British yet sanguine enough about South Viet-Nam to risk a possible major explosion in bargaining hard with the Russians on the issue.</p>

<p>151139Z. Cite <gloss target="#t_MAGCH1">MAGCH</gloss> 3887. For <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Admiral Stump</persName> and limited distribution.</p>
<p>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> assembled considerable number of the General Staff, division and region commanders and part of Cabinet at Kontum on 9 May for a conference that lasted until 12 May. He went to Kontum personally on 10 May taking Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> as guest. First night was spent in Kontum, second night in Pleiku. Villages and troops in this plateau area were visited. Furthest village to north was Darto. I did not attend the conference but travelled with the President and Chief of Staff<note n="2" xml:id="d325fn2">General <persName corresp="#p_LVT1">Le Van Ty</persName>.</note> throughout the period. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> stated purpose in having conference in Kontum was to have members of Cabinet and military commanders, many of whom had never been to the sparsely inhabited plateau country, learn something of the area and its strategic importance to Vietnam.</p>
<p>Under heavy discussion were means of improving road net for both economic and military reasons, encouragement of settlers from the coastal regions, means of winning the tribes to national government, counter action against Vietcong propaganda in the area, etc. All of which I had recommended to him repeatedly last November and December after my initial reconnaissance of this country and seemingly at that time totally without success.</p>
<p>The President, Secretaries [title deleted], Public Works,<note n="3" xml:id="d325fn3">Tran Van Meo.</note> Finance,<note n="4" xml:id="d325fn4">Tran Huu Phuong.</note> Agriculture,<note n="5" xml:id="d325fn5">Nguyen Cong Vien.</note> and other officials are really fired up with determination <pb xml:id="pg_683" n="683" facs="0713"/>to develop the plateau country. Particularly large demonstrations were held at Kontum and Pleiku by both tribesmen and Vietnamese. At Pleiku an estimated thirty thousand were assembled. The demonstrations were even greater than on our trip to the South and West last month. Personal security for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> became at times completely nil. In several long talks, with only his brother and myself present, he strengthened my belief that he is especially well informed, has a keen analytical mind and has the highest moral standards. His popularity with the “common man” today is plainly evident regardless of reports from some sources to the contrary.</p>
<p>Unquestionably, good results, military and economic, will result from this trip. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has now completely rejected the old concept inherited from French that defense of Vietnam must be limited to Ban Me Thuot and south thereof to Saigon. He rejects the old concept of buttoning up in battalion and company size forts and block houses and agrees that divisions must be kept flexible and mobile. He will have difficulty in convincing some of his commanders who had long service with the French colonial army, however his hold on them is so strong that sooner or later they will accept the doctrine and listen more readily to teaching of our advisors.</p>
<p>Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> with interpreter and aide were only whites in party and were treated with great consideration and courtesy by all. Signed <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName>.</p>

<p>4592. 1. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> and I accompanied Deputy Secretary Defense <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> when he called on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> morning May 23.<note n="2" xml:id="d326fn2"><persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Reuben Robertson</persName>’s visit to Saigon was part of a larger trip to the Far East to study and assess the military situation there.</note> President devoted interview to expounding his latest views on most urgent defense requirements of Vietnam. According to his best information and appreciation there was little danger of all-out overt aggression from North which would involve flanking movement <pb xml:id="pg_684" n="684" facs="0714"/>through Laos and Cambodia aimed at the total conquest of South Vietnam. Most probable danger, he said, was Viet Minh invasion across 17th Parallel which violated no third country frontiers and had limited objective of occupying Quang Tri and Hue Provinces, with possible view to withdrawal as soon as certain political concessions had been extracted from South. For this reason, he had instructed <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> General Staff to abandon French defensive planning which called for withdrawal from the area of the 17th Parallel in event of attack and to plan for proper defense in immediate vicinity of Parallel. (This latter reflects successful germination of idea <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> has been endeavoring to plant in <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> thinking for some time.)</p>
<p>2. With foregoing in mind, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had three specific requests:<note n="3" xml:id="d326fn3"><p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> made similar requests through the Vietnamese Ambassador in Washington, <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Tran Van Chuong</persName>, to Department officials on May 29. According to a memorandum of conversation of the meeting with <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Tran Van Chuong</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> treated these requests sympathetically and agreed to pass them on to Assistant Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Walter Robertson</persName>, but <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> did note that the United States had no reliable indications that hostilities by the Viet Minh were imminent. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/5–2956)</p>
<p>Department of State intelligence had low-level and unreliable reports that officials in Hanoi in mid-April had decided to evacuate from the Dong Hoi area (just north of the 17th parallel) all children, women caring for children, women over 30, and men over 50. In a memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Walter Robertson</persName>, May 25, <persName corresp="#p_AWPJ1">Park Armstrong</persName> pointed out that these evacuation plans provided an ominous comparison with the situation in Korea north of the 38th parallel in May and June 1950. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/5–2556)</p></note></p>
<list>
<item>First, that the United States Government make it clear to world it would regard limited aggression of this nature by Viet Minh as aggression in absolute sense and would react accordingly.<note n="4" xml:id="d326fn4">According to telegram 3922 to Saigon, June 1, the Department gave consideration to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s request for such a statement, but it believed reports of Viet Minh intentions to commit armed violation of the demarcation line were of uncertain reliability. Furthermore, the general posture of the Communist bloc as well as current propaganda of the Viet Minh did not bear out the likelihood of such a move. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.5/5–2456)</note></item>
<item>Second, that US assistance to <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> road-building program be accelerated so that strategic roads planned for area immediately behind 17th Parallel and necessary to its defense as well as economic development could be completed as soon as possible. The priority here was early arrival of much-needed road-building machinery.</item>
<item>Third, the President urged equal speed in implementation of plans to equip the Civil Guard with adequate communications and transportation matériel. In absence of this it was impossible for the Civil Guard to relieve National Army of its internal security assignments in South and West and redeployment center.</item>
</list>
<p>3. Detailed discussions took place only on second point during which <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> pointed out his efforts to coordinate <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> contribution to road-building problem with <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> Departments of Defense and Public Works. Deputy Secretary Defense <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> suggested that excess quantities of road-building equipment now in armed forces hands elsewhere in Far East might be made <pb xml:id="pg_685" n="685" facs="0715"/>available to fill this requirement. At his request he is meeting May 24 with Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> Director and myself on this problem.</p>

<p>This meeting was called for the purpose of deciding whether we should request the Defense Department to place a further temporary halt on the arrival of <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> personnel into Saigon, in the light of a new note dated May 26 from the International Commission in Viet-Nam to the Vietnamese Government<note n="2" xml:id="d327fn2">In telegram 2899 to New Delhi, May 29, the Department reported learning that “note dated May 26 addressed to French Liaison Mission Hanoi, International Commission in Viet-Nam informs Vietnamese Government that entry initial contingent <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> personnel into Viet-Nam should be further delayed, so that Commission may complete consideration of matter prior arrival this personnel.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/5–2856)</note> requesting that such arrivals be delayed until after the Commission could decide on the matter. Contingent of 86 Army personnel was now in flight between West Coast and Saigon and would depart from Clark Air Force Base, Philadelphia [<hi rend="italic">Philippines</hi>], not later than 8:00 a.m. May 30.</p>
<p>At the outset of the meeting, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> expressed his strong feeling that there should be no further delay in the movement of <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> personnel, that we had given ample time to the Commission to act, and that it seemed to him highly doubtful whether delaying this movement for another week or two would spur the Commission to faster action. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> felt that since this was a matter of great urgency, and in view of the statements he had made to the Secretary about it nearly two months earlier, indicating for example the likelihood of press leaks on this matter during Congressional presentation <pb xml:id="pg_686" n="686" facs="0716"/>on foreign aid, he felt we had been “almost neglectful” in not proceeding faster. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> further indicated that when the United States takes strong leadership on an issue, the risks and consequences are frequently far less than expected; for example, in the recent issue of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> in Korea, after we had indicated firmly that we would go through with our action, we had obtained unanimity among the 16 nations involved; moreover, in the case of <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss>, we had told the Commission powers that we would go through with the project by the end of May.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> indicated agreement with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>’s views and said that the matter had been kept pending for a long time because we had decided, at the urging of Embassy Saigon, to request formal Commission approval, beyond obtaining the approval of the Canadian and Indian Governments which had been secured shortly after the Secretary’s return from his post-<gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> trip. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> had the distinct impression the Secretary wanted us to have Commission approval of the project, but he also felt that the Secretary would not stop the project if we could not obtain such approval. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> thought the time for action had definitely come and agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> that it was essential at times to take risks for the accomplishment of a major objective.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> underlined that we had not sought Commission approval without qualifications, we had limited the period for Commission consideration to 30 days initially and this had been further extended thereafter. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> also indicated that he had understood from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gordon Gray</persName> that the Secretary had given Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> a very definite commitment that we would go in by the end of May with or without formal Commission approval, and that the British had been informed of this understanding. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> could not see going back over the very firm statements we had instructed our Embassy Saigon to make to the Indians and Canadians about our determination to go in at the end of May. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> further felt that we had given in considerably to the Commission recently and had become very much more involved in the armistice machinery than before, in terms of notification of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> arrivals, giving the ceiling figure for use of the Commission, etc. We had not yet received any quid pro quo for this increased cooperation.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> dissented with the views expressed and thought the risks in our proposed action justified waiting another two weeks or so. He felt that since we had decided to obtain Commission approval, we should await such approval. It should be remembered that <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> had a double purpose and that the risks in the whole operation were not inconsiderable, that in view of the delicacy of the armistice question at this time we should obtain full Commission approval.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_687" n="687" facs="0717"/>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> queried Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> as to what possible serious consequences could come from failure to obtain Commission approval, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> agreed that the consequences would probably not be insuperable from our point of view. However, he did not think the risks worth taking.</p>
<p>After some discussion of the degree to which we were actually bound by the decision to seek Commission approval, during which there was some evocation of the similarity between the Korean and Viet-Nam situations as to the extent to which the armistice circumscribed our actions in both areas, it was decided not to request Defense to place a further halt on the movement of this personnel. However, it was agreed that a summary history of the <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> negotiations<note n="3" xml:id="d327fn3">That summary history is in telegram 2899 to New Delhi, May 29, sent also to Ottawa and Saigon and repeated for information to London and Paris. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/5–2856)</note> would be sent out to Embassies Delhi and Ottawa to aid the latter in explaining to the Indian and Canadian Governments the reasons why we felt impelled to proceed with the movement even prior to obtaining final Commission approval.<note n="4" xml:id="d327fn4"><gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> was finally activated on June 1.</note></p>

Request your comments <gloss target="#t_ASAP1">ASAP</gloss>. Plan briefed as follows.</p>
<p>Assumed <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> forces will not intervene except provide advisors and logistic support but will pose threat of intervention particularly air power.</p>
<p>To accomplish US objectives supporting forces from US and other <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> nations must arrive within few days. Fight should be won by Vietnamese backed as much as possible by other Asians.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_688" n="688" facs="0718"/>
<p>Concept. Vietminh aggression start by surprise attack across 17 parallel. Vietnamese army will make hard fight near Quang Tri but should fall back to Tourane hill mass where make resolute defense. Meanwhile specially trained US Army advisors will have arrived Tourane. US troops including . . . will be air and sea lifted to support defense Tourane Saigon and Cam Ranh Bay. US air and naval forces attack Vietminh forces and supporting installations. Above operations commence within few days start of aggression and will be followed by support other <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> nations resulting destruction Vietminh army and enabling Vietnamese take control all Vietnam. Combined <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Command will be organized. Aside from possible large groups enemy troops there will be few if any . . .targets.</p>
<p>Tasks.</p>
<list>
<item>A. <gloss target="#t_ChMAAG1">ChMAAG</gloss> Vietnam function as joint operational commander with staff personnel airlifted to Vietnam.</item>
<item>B. Army Airborne <gloss target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss> airlifted from . . . to Tourane.</item>

These <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> units attack enemy forces and supporting installations, provide direct air support Vietnamese army, provide intra theater airlift and be prepared defend against <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> air and retaliate against <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> air bases.</item>
<item>E. 2500 army specially trained officers and noncoms air lifted immediately to Vietnam as advisors.</item>
<item>F. 2 marine <gloss target="#t_RLT1">RLT</gloss> in amphib shipping moved to Vietnam immediately, 1 to Saigon and 1 to Cam Ranh Bay.</item>
<item>G. Army . . . <gloss target="#t_bns1">bn</gloss> . . . airlifted to Saigon or Tourane to provide visible evidence US support.</item>
<item>H. US amphib lift for 3 Vietnamese divisions kept available in Saigon area.</item>
<item>I. Other <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> forces support opns.</item>
</list>
<p>Preparatory measures include selecting and training army advisors, training selected Vietnamese in exploiting air and naval support conduct combined <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> trng exercises, prepare move tactical air control parties and prepare for early deployment US forces for ground delivery . . ..</p>
<p>Above will reduce capability defend Japan.</p>
<p>Above concept will not seriously disrupt military stature in other areas and presents good prospects success. . . . will not be great factor in fight against Vietminh alone. Forces required essentially the same whether or not . . . used. Communist conviction US intervention in event aggression best possible deterrent such aggression.</p>

<p>1. I concur in the principle of the Vietnamese defending as far north as possible but seriously doubt their ability to make an effective defense in the Tourane area unless allied ground reinforcements can be introduced by D-plus seven. Although considerable progress is expected [illegible word] Vietnamese forces within next year, it is estimated that the Viet Minh will retain a numerical superiority on the order of at least two to one. A flanking attack through Laos is therefore a constant threat but this is not likely to be a decisive factor due to rainy season west of mountains until fall.</p>
<p>2. <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> countries have yet to commit forces to the defense of this area. However, I belive it is optimistic to assume their total contribution will be more than the equivalent of one US division and minor naval and air forces and this only if the United States leads the way. Neither Laos nor Cambodia will contribute any forces except for their own defense and wouldn’t be of much help if they did. <gloss target="#t_ChiNats1">ChiNat</gloss> units could be considered available only in event of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> intervention.</p>
<p>3. Even with outside help, other than US, Viet Minh ground force superiority is estimated at four or five divisions. This could be only partially offset by US Naval and Air Force support alone. The nature of the terrain, weather and Viet Minh guerrilla tactics will limit the effectiveness of naval and air support, with or without . . . weapons. Effectiveness of allied ground operations will also be handicapped by the limited opportunity to employ heavy weapons and equipment including . . . units.</p>
<p>4. Concept should be enlarged to provide for destruction of Viet Minh army by decisive action north of the 17th parallel. This can be accomplished by early amphibious assault in the Vinh area by US Navy and Marine forces and rapid expansion of the lodgement to cut Viet Minh <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>, seal off enemy forces to the south and prepare for further offensive to north to seize and occupy North Vietnam. Draft plan <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> OP Plan 49–56 regarding [?] this concept forwarded 31 May to <gloss target="#t_CNO1">CNO</gloss>.<note n="3" xml:id="d329fn3">Not found, but see <ref target="#d335fn5">footnote 5, Document 335</ref>.</note></p>
<p>5. I estimate that a minimum of two US divisions will be required to initiate the operations envisaged in the concept as explained <pb xml:id="pg_690" n="690" facs="0720"/>in para 4 above. Depending on success of initial operations, additional US forces may be requested to completely defeat and occupy North Vietnam.</p>
<p>6. I am sure that all concerned recognize that the effectiveness of the initial defense will be dependent on the timely introduction of US and allied forces with appropriate logistical support in the area of operations. The immediate availability of air and surface lift will be most critical factor.</p>
<p>7. Consider that principal US combat effort should be made in Vinh area. Do not believe that Cam Ranh Bay should be an initial defense area except for mobile support forces, unless Tourane cannot be held.</p>
<p>8. Subject to foregoing remarks and specific comments to follow I concur in your 301549Z May.</p>
<list>
<item>Task Alpha. Consider <gloss target="#t_ChMAAG1">ChMAAG</gloss> Vietnam should be designated as initial US ground operational commander supported by US Air Force and Naval forces under overall direction of <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>. A <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> command should be organized earliest in which case <gloss target="#t_ChMAAG1">ChMAAG</gloss> Vietnam would be the logical <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> ground command in Vietnam. In order to retain US control, consider <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> most logical choice for overall <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> commander.</item>
<item>Task Bravo. In considering the use of Army troops ashore, I have a feeling that Congress will not allow US Army forces to be committed in Vietnam but might permit Marine forces to be so committed. I say this because the powerful [?] political repercussion on the American people would be less with the use of Marines than it would with Army troops.</item>
<item>Task Elmo. In any consideration of the effectiveness of Vietnamese forces, we must realize that none of their military leaders have had any experience or training above the battalion level and relatively few even as high as company level. Therefore, I concur it will be absolutely necessary to make a great increase in military army advisers, to furnish advice and guidance from the division down through the battalion command levels and possibly, in many cases, company levels. These advisers must arrive at the earliest date. They should be ear-marked as part of US participation and be ready to proceed on short notice by air. In this concept, we should remember that the Viet Minh, on the other hand, have been organized by divisions at the time when the French were fighting on battalion level and, therefore, possess the experience and a capability not possessed by the Vietnam Army.</item>
<item>Task Foxtrot. Believe at least one Marine <gloss target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss> should be deployed rapidly to Saigon to bolster Vietnamese morale and will to fight, ensure security of that vital area and protect US lives and property. However, Marine forces should deploy as air-ground task forces as nearly as practical. A Marine force of one division-wing size should be prepared for amphibious assault at Vinh at earliest date about D-plus thirty days. Composition of Vinh assault force would be determined by best utilization of amphibious lift in Pacific. <pb xml:id="pg_691" n="691" facs="0721"/>Marine air support for landing would use Tourane and other airfields and carriers as available.</item>
<item>Task Hotel. All available US amphibious lift in Pacific will be required for initial deployment US forces and early assault at Vinh. Principal Vietnam Army units committed to defense of southern area of South Vietnam should be deployed there in advance. Vietnamese are not capable of large scale amphibious assault but could be used as follow up forces using administrative lift. Preparatory measures. These should include means to logistically support US and indigenous forces for sustained operations from the onset. Planning should include use of facilities in . . . and Guam.</item>
</list>
<p>9. In the event US ground forces are not made available for operations in Vietnam, US Air and Naval forces only in support of the Vietnamese would be insufficient to accomplish the stated objective “destruction of Viet Minh Army and enabling Vietnamese to take control of all Vietnam” and the defeat of the Vietnamese would probably follow. If US ground forces are committed to the defense of Vietnam they must be in numbers sufficient to ensure the early defeat of the Viet Minh and reinforcements should be prepared to be moved into the area quickly in the event of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> intervention.</p>
<p>10. I agree completely with the last sentence of your msg. Further, I believe that in case of Viet Minh aggression the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiComs</gloss> should be told that the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiComs</gloss> may expect attack from US forces if they intervene or assist Viet Minh. While in a democratic country like the US an aroused people will force their government into war, such is not the case in a Communist country, leaders of which will permit a war to start only if they think they can win, or if they think they can consolidate their power within their own country. Therefore, an attack against Communist China by US or <gloss target="#t_ChiNats1">ChiNat</gloss> forces if necessary to carry out our threat will be a “limited war” unless the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> and Soviet Governments desire a general war. They would use such an attack only as a pretext for a war they otherwise desired in the first place.</p>

Will follow detailed study, soonest.</p>
<p>A. The assumption made is hazardous. <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> reenforcement by individual or unit could be easily accomplished without our early knowledge. There are Cambodians, Laotians and Chinese in Vietnamese forces and undoubtedly in <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> forces. These races are difficult to distinguish at sight even by natives. I believe <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> volunteers will march, at least in Vietminh uniform, at first sign of American intervention to secure North Vietnam while Vietminh invaded south.</p>
<p>B. Support forces to arrive in few days is most essential to success.</p>
<p>C. Fight cannot be won by outnumbered Vietnamese in present state of organization, strength and training. What other Asians are counted upon? Certainly not from Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand. Perhaps a regiment from the Philippines.</p>
<p>D. Any attack across the 17 parallel will be coupled with infiltration through mountains to west and along both sides of the Laos border, an area very thinly populated by a mountaineer race, a border poorly marked and more poorly guarded. Such forces probably bypass or turn any defensive position long held north of Tourane. Even if Tourane line is made impregnable it can be turned by movement to west and then south with hostile debouchment into high plateau vicinity of Kontum and north thereof. A highly strategic area. East and west roads in this area are practically nonexistent and interest in them only lately aroused in Vietnamese. Terrain favors north and south movement as contrast to east and west movement to intercept.</p>
<p>E. . . . battalion deployment at Cam Ranh Bay, Saigon and Tourane is not understood. There probably be no fighting at Saigon or Cam Ranh Bay in early stages that would present suitable targets.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_693" n="693" facs="0723"/>
<p>F. Agree there will be few . . . targets other than troops. Due to heavy growth of jungle on plateau and mountain, troop targets will be very hard to locate. However, air delivery north of 17 parallel probably profitable for road destruction. Low ceiling during certain periods and resulting poor visibility must be taken into serious consideration in all air plans.</p>
<p>G. Joint Staff airlift would need be very fast, communications and logistical units also. Have only 2 or 3 <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> officers that can work on plans due to primary duty. Vietnamese communications, military and civilian, inadequate for peace much less war.</p>
<p>H. Additional advisors should speak and read Vietnamese or French as current number of interpreters barely adequate. Must come fast and win confidence of Vietnamese who have had sad combat experience with French officers.</p>
<p>I. Doubt need Marines at Cam Ranh Bay. Same for Saigon unless merely to show the flag.</p>
<p>J. Preparatory measures should include earmarked Chief of Staff and few key Staff Officers located Hawaii, due <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> ceiling, to develop detailed plans, making frequent reconnaissance trips to Vietnam. Should have Washington Saigon unmistakeable agreement all Vietnamese forces come under joint operations commanders command at first shot.</p>
<p>K. Heartily concur in last sentence <gloss target="#t_CNO1">CNO</gloss> message.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Defense Presentation: “Capability to Deal with Local Aggression in Vietnam”–<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Agenda, June 7, 1956</item>
</list>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
<p>1. In the review of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5501<note n="2" xml:id="d331fn2"><gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5501, “Basic National Security Policy”, January 6, 1955, is not printed.</note> last fall, one of the basic issues isolated by the Planning Board for an intensive study was the problem of local war.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_694" n="694" facs="0724"/>
<p>In order to deal with local war, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5501, as adopted in January 1955, called for highly mobile U.S. forces suitably equipped for local war, including atomic capability, but not dependent on use of atomic weapons for effective action. The Planning Board considered it essential that the U.S. forces should be sufficiently flexible so that a decision to intervene would not automatically mean a decision to employ nuclear weapons. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602/1<note n="3" xml:id="d331fn3"><gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602/1, “Basic National Security Policy”, March 15, 1956, is not printed.</note> in general reaffirms the necessity for ready mobile units with selective and flexible capability and not inevitably dependent on tactical nuclear weapons. (See paragraphs 15 and 16 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602/1 attached.<note n="4" xml:id="d331fn4">Not attached to the source text.</note>)</p>
<p>2. The Planning Board was not entirely satisfied that such mobile and flexible forces were receiving the amount of attention and resources which they deserved. In order to enable the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> to determine whether this was the case, the Planning Board recommended that the Department of Defense should make a special presentation of such U.S. capabilities using Vietnam as a test case.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Purpose</p>
<p>3. The Defense presentation will be most useful to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> if it is organized to clarify:</p>
<list>
<item>a. Whether the U.S. has sufficient mobile striking forces in an adequate state of readiness;</item>
<item>b. Whether there is air lift available to move such forces immediately;</item>
<item>c. Whether these forces have been organized, trained, and equipped for local war conditions in vulnerable local areas;</item>
<item>d. Whether they have capability for conventional combat in situations in which it may be unfeasible to employ nuclear weapons;</item>
<item>e. What principles will govern any planned use of nuclear weapons in local war situations; targets, restrictions, political and military objectives.</item>
</list>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Prospect</p>
<p>4. No papers have been circulated, and Defense is closely holding the substance of its presentation. The essential elements involved present peculiarly difficult service issues in the roles and missions of forces and in the allocation of budgetary and manpower resources. There is some reason to believe that the presentation may stress the particulars of the Vietnam situation at the expense of a basic review of U.S. local war capabilities. In addition, it may be designed to over-turn the existing policy which would enable decision regarding use of nuclear weapons to be made at the time in the light of political and other factors.</p>

<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> reminded the Council of the considerations which had led to the presentation on the reference subject, and then called upon <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> to present his report. (A copy of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName>’s brief is filed in the minutes of the meeting.<note n="5" xml:id="d332fn5">Not found.</note>)</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> described his presentation as one dealing with the capabilities, “with or without atomic weapons”, of U.S. ready military forces to deal with local aggression in Vietnam. He next ran through the assumptions which had been made for the purpose of this presentation, and followed this with an outline of the present military situation in Vietnam, both in the North and in the South. He next covered the principles governing U.S. participation, the concept <pb xml:id="pg_697" n="697" facs="0727"/>of operations, force deployments and tasks, preparatory military steps, supplementary actions, and implications. In summary and by way of conclusion, <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said he wished to stress that the United States was in a position to intervene on the side of Free Vietnam along the lines outlined in his report, without serious disruption in other areas and with good prospects of success. He also desired to point out that initially the forces required, whether or not atomic weapons were to be used, would be essentially the same, since there were no known fixed military targets in North Vietnam that could not be destroyed by conventional bombing. On the other hand, if concentration of Viet Minh troops provided an atomic target, the use of atomic weapons might end the aggression very rapidly. If the Chinese Communists intervened openly, all this would change. Our air forces would of necessity use atomic weapons against Chinese air and logistic bases at once. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> closed with the statement that when U.S. forces were deployed rapidly in such situations as the one described in Vietnam, they must be prepared to defend themselves or to take offensive action immediately with atomic weapons. Without such an assumption, our military deployments, if not to be of the emergency desperation type which characterized the Korean intervention, would of necessity be larger and much slower. (A copy of <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>’s report is filed in the minutes of the meeting.<note n="6" xml:id="d332fn6"><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>’s report is printed <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</note>)</p>
<p>At the conclusion of <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>’s report, the President turned and asked the members of the Council if they had any questions to ask.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that he thought the presentation had been admirably handled. It was not only encouraging from a military point of view, but indicated that assistance to Vietnam against external aggression was well within the political capabilities of the United States. Thus, continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, we could anticipate assistance from the contingents of the Thai, Filipino, Australian, New Zealand, and Pakistani armed forces. He was more doubtful of British and French military participation. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said that he agreed with this estimate of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, but added that in any case the United States would not desire French participation, and the main objective would be to assure Asian military participation with the United States in helping Vietnam or any other Southeast Asian state to resist external aggression. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> added that the British would almost certainly provide naval assistance if such a contingency arose.</p>
<p>Turning to <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>, the President inquired how far our military people were making plans with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> against <pb xml:id="pg_698" n="698" facs="0728"/>the contingency of aggression against Free Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> replied that we had not as yet done any military planning with the Vietnamese. He thought, however, that permission should be given to our military people to sit down with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s military people and devise plans for resisting aggression. At the present time the Vietnamese authorities entertained genuine doubts as to whether the United States would actually intervene to assist Vietnam if it were the victim of Communist aggression. They fear that the United States might take the stand that aggression by the Viet Minh was simply a civil war, although such a notion, said <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>, had never even occurred to him. Briefly discussing possible invasion routes which would be used by an invading Viet Minh army, <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> reassured the Council that the present military dispositions of the Viet Minh indicated no current intention to launch any large-scale military aggression. Moreover, said <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>, they would be very foolish indeed to attempt such an aggression.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> observed that if the peoples of the area of Southeast Asia could have any idea of the nature of the discussion which was now taking place in the National Security Council, the effect of such knowledge would be altogether revolutionary. It would, in fact, change the whole attitude of these nations. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> realized how hard it would be to convey an idea of the nature of this discussion without raising serious problems of security. Nevertheless, if such knowledge could filter to the governments and peoples of these Southeast Asian countries, it would revive hope and confidence and would constitute a very great deterrent to aggression and war.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> pointed out that U.S. military officers in the Far East were constantly being shifted as their tours of duty ended. He recommended that before new replacements were sent to the Far East, an opportunity should be provided to these new commanding officers to visit those areas of South Vietnam which in the course of his report he had indicated would be the areas to which U.S. forces would be deployed in the event of a Viet Minh aggression against Free Vietnam.</p>
<p>The President asked <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> why <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> in Vietnam could not arrange for our officers to visit the sites he had mentioned. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said that of course <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> could make such arrangements, but that if he did so the facts would presently become public knowledge. The President replied by stating that some additional evidence of U.S. concern for the independence of Vietnam might be usefully conveyed by the appearance of these officers. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> agreed heartily with the President’s point, but indicated that the terms of the Geneva Agreements on Indochina prevented our sending in additional military personnel. The President’s <pb xml:id="pg_699" n="699" facs="0729"/>advice was to take out an orderly temporarily and put a colonel in his place (laughter).</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> asked the President whether he could call on Assistant Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Walter Robertson</persName> to make a brief comment on the matter of using atomic weapons which had been alluded to by <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> in his report. The President agreed, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Robertson</persName> stated that of course all the members of the National Security Council would agree that the use of atomic weapons in Asia would have the very gravest impact on public opinion throughout Asia, and that we would not resort to the use of atomic weapons in that area except in the gravest of situations.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> replied that he certainly could not be included in the group which would subscribe to the view just presented by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Robertson</persName>.</p>
<p>At this point the Acting Secretary of Defense, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Reuben Robertson</persName>, pointed out that he had not long since had several hours of conversation with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, and would like to indicate to the Council some of the points he had learned as a result of these conversations. He said that, in the first place, he shared <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>’s feeling that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was very uncertain about the willingness of the United States to intervene to assist Vietnam in the event of external aggression. He was very anxious that in our program of economic assistance we devote resources to improving roads and communications, particularly lateral roads in the northern area of Free Vietnam.</p>
<p>Secondly, up until now <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had been adhering to the French plan to meet a Viet Minh aggression. This French plan did not contemplate an immediate defense on the 17th parallel, but a withdrawal of the Vietnamese forces when the attack was launched, from the 17th parallel to the area of Tourane. Now, however, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has embraced the U.S. concept of a vigorous defense at the 17th parallel.</p>
<p>Thirdly, Acting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Robertson</persName> also agreed that if the Vietnamese had any idea that we would surely back them up in the event of aggression, it would have a most revolutionary effect on their thinking and on their courage.</p>
<p>Finally, as to the problem of atomic weapons raised by Assistant Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> a moment ago, Acting Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said he had had some discussion of this problem with the leading officials . . . not long since. They had been enormously impressed with . . . evidence of atomic capabilities. . . . . <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had likewise shown no concern with respect to the possible use of atomic weapons in resistance to Communist aggression. He shared the view . . . as to the great value of a show of strength.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_700" n="700" facs="0730"/>
<p>In response to Acting Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName>, the President wondered whether we could not send some Nikes to Southeast Asia equipped with small atomic warheads.</p>
<p>After further comment and discussion by the President on the purely military tactics of resisting a Viet Minh invasion, Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said that he would like to comment on this matter of “a show of strength”. He believed that if it was at all possible, the United States should strongly suggest that the future of Asia rests with those Asian countries which were allied with the West. This he believed was the kind of psychology it was desired to instill in this area.</p>
<p>Acting Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> stated his belief that if it could somehow be contrived to introduce some American colonels, or other American officials of high rank, into those sites in Vietnam to which U.S. forces might be deployed in the event of aggression, such a course of action would have the tonic effect which Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had commented on at the conclusion of <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>’s report.</p>
<p>The President replied that he of course had been facetious in suggesting that orderlies be withdrawn and colonels substituted in their place. Nevertheless, he was earnest in his belief that our military people should discreetly indicate that the United States has an active interest in the area of Free Vietnam. This is the real point that we wish to get across, and it should be possible to devise methods by which our attitude in this respect could be made known. Acting Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> stated that the Defense Department would certainly proceed to make plans along the line suggested by the President.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> then indicated that the intelligence community believed that the greatest threat at the moment to Free Vietnam was the soft position of Laos and the weakness of Cambodia. Laos was divided, and Cambodia had embarked on a neutralist policy. These facts exposed Vietnam to possible invasion through Laos or Cambodia at some future time.</p>
<p>The President replied that, as everyone knew, he was all for helping countries which are determined to maintain their own independence. He too doubted whether the Viet Minh would attack Free Vietnam through the narrow corridor along the sea and across the 17th parallel. If they undertook to invade, the Viet Minh would probably march down along a broader front through Laos.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> then commented on the fact that we had not had a Minister or Ambassador in Laos for some considerable period now and, in view of the situation, should make every effort to get one there as soon as possible. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that unhappily the last one had returned as a sick man and a casualty. The capital, Vientiane, was a terrible diplomatic post, with no sanitary facilities, <pb xml:id="pg_701" n="701" facs="0731"/>no decent drinking water, or other elementary necessities. The President said, with a smile, couldn’t we at least ship out spring water? Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, also with a smile, replied that the President’s suggestion had severe budgetary implications (laughter). Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then indicated that he would have an able Foreign Service Officer in Vientiane not later than mid-July.</p>
<p>Acting Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> then expressed the hope that the United States would undertake to repeat other operations modeled on the very successful Firm Link. He indicated that this was the strong recommendation of both the Thais and the Filipinos.</p>
<p>At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> asked the President whether he wished to have the Record of Action indicate a request to our military people to undertake joint planning with their Vietnamese opposite numbers and, furthermore, that our military take steps to indicate the firm interest of the United States in the continued freedom of Vietnam.</p>
<p>The President replied by expressing doubt as to whether the suggestions he had made along this line actually could lend themselves to inclusion in a formal Record of Action. Rather, the President said, what he had in mind was a “series of little things” done by our military people and other representatives, rather than a broad and formal course of action. For one thing, the President added, we must avoid making commitments to Vietnam that we are in no position to carry out. After all, the President said smilingly, the Council should not forget that this Administration may not be here in Washington after next January. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> said that he would try to draft an action in line with these ideas of the President. The President said he wanted <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> to concur in any proposed Council action on this subject. Further, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> must be sure that the action gave our military people the needed leeway and yet imposed the needed caution.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> pointed out that there was always a danger that if we do undertake joint planning with countries like Vietnam in the military field, their people think these plans constitute an actual positive commitment on the part of the United States to carry out such plans.</p>
<p>The President then turned to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and inquired of him how far the Administration was authorized, under the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Treaty, to intervene with military force to help resist aggression on short notice and without resort to Congressional authorization.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that the President could do this in a few hours if it should prove necessary, but that he strongly recommended consultation with the Congress if the Congress were in session at the time the aggression occurred. He cited the appropriate portions of the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Treaty which he said had become the law of the land, but <pb xml:id="pg_702" n="702" facs="0732"/>repeated his view that Congressional authority should be obtained, if it was readily available, in the event of the emergency.</p>
<p>The President expressed agreement with the view of the Secretary of State, and said that this would give a little more leeway to our military people in their planning, though we must carefully guard against the spread of any idea that we are sitting down to plan a war with our friends in Vietnam or anywhere else.</p>
<p>Acting Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> noted the limits on the numbers of our military people in Vietnam, which were imposed by the Geneva Armistice Agreement. Under the circumstances, he wondered if Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> felt that there would be any merit, in the light of the known build-up of Viet Minh military forces in defiance of the Geneva Agreements, for the United States following the same course of action that it had earlier followed in the area of the Formosa Straits. By this, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Robertson</persName>, he meant getting the advance approval of the Congress for intervention in the event of external Communist aggression.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he was opposed to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Robertson</persName>’s suggestion. He said he believed that the conditions in Vietnam were not at all comparable with those in the Taiwan area. In brief, the United States could not portray any immediate danger of military aggression against Free Vietnam, as we had been quite justified in fearing in the case of Taiwan.</p>
<p>The President commented that in any event <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> keeps repeating that the Chinese Communists are going to take Formosa, by military means if necessary. Nothing quite comparable to this has been said by the Viet Minh with reference to South Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> expressed agreement, but said he must point out that some sort of tense situation might develop between North and South Vietnam around the first of next July, when the elections were scheduled to take place under the Geneva Agreements, but which, of course, Free Vietnam refused to be bound by. The President added that he was not worried. Congress would still be here at that time, adding, facetiously, he was “sorry to say”.</p>

<p rend="center">BROAD OUTLINE PLAN FOR U.S. MILITARY PARTICIPATION IN THE EVENT OF VIET MINH AGGRESSION IN VIET NAM</p>
<p>This is a presentation of the capabilities, with or without atomic weapons, of U.S. ready military forces to deal with “local aggression in Viet Nam”. Assumption is made that aggression in this sense is overt military action by Viet Minh forces against Viet Nam. The concept that I will present will cover only those operations directed towards stopping overt Viet Minh aggression south of the 17th Parallel. I will not attempt to cover subsequent operations that might be undertaken to retake North Viet Nam. While it is recognized that stopping Viet Minh aggression south of the 17th Parallel might well expand into operations for the destruction of the Viet Minh Army and the establishment of Vietnamese control over all of Viet Nam, the nature and scope of these operations would depend on the situation at the time and our estimate of the capabilities of the Vietnamese Army. If it appeared that with U.S. Naval, Air, and limited U.S. Army (<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>) and logistical support the Vietnamese had the capability of retaking North Viet Nam, it is my hope that we would encourage them to do so. We would not want to deploy large U.S. ground forces in this operation.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_704" n="704" facs="0734"/>
<p>For the purpose of this presentation, certain assumptions have been made. First, it is assumed that Communist Chinese military forces will not intervene on the side of the Viet Minh, except to provide aid in the form of supplies, equipment and advisors. However, the Chinese Communist military forces will pose a threat of intervention, particularly with their air power which must be recognized in our plans. A second assumption is that the Manila Pact will be invoked and at least several <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> nations will furnish at least token forces to aid the Vietnamese. Such aid is highly desirable for psychological reasons and should be sought vigorously, but it is not expected that at least initially the contributions from these nations will significantly affect the military situation.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Military Situation</p>
<p>Now I would like to outline briefly the present military situation in Viet Nam.</p>
<list>
<item>a. Since the armistice agreements reached at Geneva in 1954, the Viet Minh Army has undergone considerable reorganization and its firepower has greatly increased. This increase in firepower has come about as a result of large-scale shipments of arms and equipment from Communist China in violation of the Geneva Agreements. It is presently estimated that the Viet Minh Army consists of 257,000 regular troops organized into 14 combat-ready infantry divisions, 2 artillery divisions, and the necessary supporting units. In addition, there are 41,000 regional and 75,000 popular troops. As yet the Viet Minh have no Air Force or Navy.</item>
<item>b. The Vietnamese Army consists of 156,000 regular troops organized into 4 field divisions, 6 light divisions, 13 territorial regiments, and supporting units. In addition, there are 75,000 to 80,000 men in South Viet Nam with previous military training who are available for induction. While much progress has been made in improving the effectiveness of the Army, there are still major weaknesses in leadership and tactical control of the combat units, and in logistics. Morale in the Army is good and, with more experience and training, over-all effectiveness will improve. South Viet Nam has only a small Air Force and Navy.</item>
<item>c. Except for miscellaneous troops numbering less than 300, the French military forces will be completely phased out of Viet Nam by the end of this month.</item>
<item>d. The Viet Minh ground forces have been organized and trained for a much greater period of time than have the Vietnamese and, as a result, still maintain an advantage in per unit effectiveness and the capability of defeating the unassisted forces of South Viet Nam. However, it should be pointed out that there are great natural difficulties confronting a major invasion effort by the Viet Minh. The terrain, with very few exceptions, naturally lends itself to defense. The paucity of North/South roads, the narrowness of the path of advance, and its vulnerability from the sea, present very formidable problems for any advancing force. Without air power both for reconnaissance <pb xml:id="pg_705" n="705" facs="0735"/>and direct support of ground forces, an overt Viet Minh ground offensive in strength will be most difficult.</item>
</list>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Principles Governing Participation</p>
<p>An objective of our National Security Policy is to deter possible local aggressions, or in the event such aggressions take place, to intervene swiftly and decisively, in a manner and on a scale best calculated to prevent hostilities from expanding and broadening into general war. In the event of Viet Minh military aggression against South Viet Nam there are certain fundamental principles which will govern the United States participation. First, to check the aggression it is most important that early U.S. support be provided, that this support begin within a matter of hours—and that certain essential units be in place within a few days at most. It is equally important that support from other <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> nations be provided quickly and that these actions taken under <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> be clearly announced in order that news of this outside support quickly becomes common knowledge to all of South Viet Nam and other countries in Southeast Asia. The quickness of support and the attendant publicity will firm up the spirit of the Vietnamese people so that they will fight with determination and confidence. They must be made to realize early that by the positive actions being taken the United States will back them to the hilt. But even more important from a psychological viewpoint will be the support from <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. For political reasons, victory should be won by the Vietnamese backed as much as possible by other Asians. What we should seek and attain is an Asian victory over Asians.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Concept of Operations</p>
<p>I would now like to outline the general concept of operations. In these operations it is intended that the Vietnamese Army, supported primarily by U.S. Air and Naval power, will carry the main burden of the defeat of the aggression. U.S. ground forces will be provided primarily to assist in the defense of vital areas in South Viet Nam, thereby both reducing the requirements for Vietnamese troops in security roles and providing them with a feeling of confidence that the security of these vital areas will be maintained. An important aspect is that these operations will be carried out in the presence of a friendly population, as contrasted to the situation facing the French. A further important facet of these operations is to provide specially trained U.S. advisors for duty with the Vietnamese Army. These advisors will be attached to the fighting units, not just at command headquarters. Previous experience has amply demonstrated the success of such provisions.</p>
<p>The Viet Minh aggression will probably start with a surprise attack across the 17th Parallel. The Vietnamese Army may be expected <pb xml:id="pg_706" n="706" facs="0736"/>to make a hard fight in the area of Quang Tri. If this fight is unsuccessful, the Vietnamese should fall back to the hill mass to the northwest of the Tourane, where a resolute defense of the Tourane Base would be made. A successful defense of this vital position is the key to the defense of South Viet Nam. Before the time the Vietnamese have fallen back to this vital position, U.S. support in the form of specially trained U.S. ground forces, with atomic support, should be in place at Tourane. The timely arrival of these forces is essential. In addition, other U.S. ground forces will be air and surface lifted to support the defense of Saigon and Cam Ranh Bay. U.S. Air and Naval Forces will launch attacks against Viet Minh military forces and supporting installations, and will be ready to give direct support to Vietnamese ground forces. Air operations by U.S. forces should commence within 24 hours after the start of the aggression. Once Viet Minh advance has been checked in Tourane area, preparations should be made to regain Quang Tri area and the highway to Laos.</p>
<p>A combined <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> command should be organized as soon as possible, with representation by all the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> powers and with some responsible positions held by Vietnamese officers. (It is likely that Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> will be the Commander in Chief and our plans will include necessary augmentation of his staff.)</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Force Deployments and Tasks</p>
<p>The U.S. and other <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> forces to be deployed to Viet Nam and their tasks to carry out the concept of operations are as follows:</p>
<list>
<item>a. A U.S. Regimental Combat Team (with Honest John Missile Battalion) will be immediately airlifted . . . to the Tourane Airbase to assist in the defense of this vital area. A second <gloss target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss> should be alerted for air movement into Tourane on short notice.</item>
<item>b. The U.S. Navy Fast Carrier Task Force consisting of 3 or 4 Attack Carriers, with necessary supporting combat ships, will immediately proceed from its present station in the Far East to Viet Nam to cover the landings of U.S. ground forces, to carry out attacks against Viet Minh military forces and supporting installations, to provide direct air support to the Vietnamese Army, and to be prepared to retaliate against their airbases if the Chinese Communist Air Force intervenes. Establish Naval blockade of North Viet Nam. Patrol coastal waters of North and South Viet Nam.</item>
<item>c. The following U.S. Air Force units will be deployed immediately . . . to the bases indicated:
<list>
<item>(1) 1 Fighter Bomber Wing and 1 Interceptor Squadron to Tourane Airbase.</item>
<item>(2) 1 Fighter Bomber Squadron, . . . and 1 Interceptor Squadron to Tan Son Nhut Airbase near Saigon.</item>
<item>(3) 1 Jet Light Bombardment Squadron, . . . and 1 Interceptor Squadron to Don Muang Airbase near Bangkok.</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_707" n="707" facs="0737"/>
<item>(4) 1 Medium Troop Carrier Wing to Cap St. Jacques Airbase.</item>
<item>(5) <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> units from Guam will be deployed to Clark Field on standby for possible operations against Chinese Communists.</item>
</list></item>
<item>d. Two additional U.S. <gloss target="#t_RLT1">RLT</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss>’s will be lifted in amphibious shipping as soon as possible from Japan and/or Okinawa to Viet Nam to assist in the defense of Saigon and the Cap St. Jacques/Cam Ranh Bay areas. One or both of these <gloss target="#t_RLT1">RLT</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss>’s may be landed at Tourane should the military situation so require. Assault shipping will not be required for this operation. It is estimated that by Using administrative lift one <gloss target="#t_RLT1">RLT</gloss> from Okinawa could be landed in about 10 days.</item>
<item>e. U.S. personnel as required to enable Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Viet Nam to function as an operational commander, to be airlifted to Viet Nam. it is visualized that the Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, with an appropriate staff, will become the commander of a combined <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> command.</item>
<item>f. Specially trained U.S. advisory personnel will be airlifted immediately to Viet Nam for assignment as advisors with combat units down to the regimental level and as technical advisors with logistics support organizations.</item>
<item>g. Sea-lift for selected Vietnamese forces will be kept available in the Cam Ranh Bay/Cap St. Jacques area for use in transporting Vietnamese units as may be required and as a threat to the Viet Minh. Marine units will train Vietnamese units in amphibious operations.</item>
<item>h. Such ground, naval, and air units provided by other <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> nations will be assigned appropriate tasks in support of the operations.</item>
<item>i. The necessary administrative and service support units required to support U.S. and allied operations will be moved in by surface shipping.</item>
</list>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Preparatory Military Steps</p>
<p>1. Some of the preparatory military steps that must be taken in advance in order to be able to carry out these operations are:</p>
<list>
<item>a. Select and train U.S. advisory personnel to be assigned to the Vietnamese Army.</item>
<item>b. Special training for selected Vietnamese personnel, outside of Viet Nam if necessary, in U.S. methods of employing naval and air support in ground operations, and in amphibious operations. Instruction will also be provided in the special tactics and techniques of employing atomic weapons support.</item>
<item>c. Conduct combined training exercises with other <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> nations. The “Firm link” exercise conducted in February this year in Bangkok was highly successful in demonstrating possibilities along this line.</item>
<item>d. Make preparation for the rapid movement of tactical air control parties and ground liaison, logistics and communication personnel to Viet Nam to insure an early capability for U.S. supporting operations. Similarly, preparations can be made for early deployment of <pb xml:id="pg_708" n="708" facs="0738"/>special U.S. forces to provide a capability for ground delivery of atomic weapons.</item>
<item>e. Road systems should be developed to meet logistic requirements in support of military operations.</item>
<item>f. Prepare plans for the early deployment of air units to the area to include detailed targeting for initial strikes.</item>
</list>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Supplementary Actions</p>
<p>In addition to the actions that I have previously set forth, there are other supplementary actions that may be required. Since Viet Minh aggression would violate and probably nullify the Geneva Convention, we should be prepared to augment the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>’s and military aid programs in Laos and Cambodia. We should be prepared to occupy the Seno Airbase in Laos. The Thais should be urged to move troops to northeast border positions along the Mekong. The Philippines should be particularly urged to make a sizable ground contingent available (One <gloss target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss>).</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Implications</p>
<p>The deployment of U.S. forces from the Japan, Korea, or Okinawa–Formosa area will, of course, reduce our military capability in these areas. Depending upon the situation at the time, it may be necessary to replace the forces withdrawn from those areas. In order to provide logistic support for the forces deployed to Viet Nam in this operation, some construction may be required in Viet Nam. This construction would be largely in improved air base facilities and temporary storage facilities. Improvement in roads and some port facilities might also be required.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary and Conclusions</p>
<p>This is a broad presentation of the capabilities of the U.S. military forces to assist the defeat of aggression in Viet Nam. I would like to stress that the U.S. could intervene on the side of the Vietnamese in the manner and on the scale just outlined without serious disruption to our military posture in other areas and with good prospects of success. I would also like to point out that initially the forces required, whether or not atomic weapons are to be used, would be essentially the same since there are no known fixed military targets in North Viet Nam that could not be destroyed by conventional bombing particularly since we assume no air opposition. If concentration of Viet Minh troops provided an atomic target, the use of such a weapon might end the aggression very rapidly. If the Chinese Communists intervened openly, this would change. Our Air Forces would of necessity use atomic weapons against Chinese air and logistic bases at once.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_709" n="709" facs="0739"/>
<p>I would close by saying that when U.S. forces are deployed rapidly in situations such as these, they must be prepared to defend themselves or to take offensive action immediately with atomic weapons. Without such an assumption, our military deployments (if they are not to be of the emergency, desperation type which characterized the Korean intervention) would of necessity be larger and much slower.</p>

<p>Following are my detailed comments on <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> plan:</p>
<p>A. Basic assumption that <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> forces will pose threat of intervention leads to conclusion that threat will also be made against Korea and <gloss target="#t_ChiNats1">ChiNats</gloss> probably pinning down the only important Asiatic support which could come to the aid of Vietnam.</p>
<p>B. Concur whole-heartedly that fight should be won by Vietnamese backed by other Asians; however, when faced with reality the concept appears to conflict with fact that Vietnamese under the present force ceiling will be outnumbered 2 to 1 by Viet Minh and that large scale Asiatic support would not appear to be forthcoming.</p>
<p>C. The hard fight in the Quang Tri area against attack should be encouraged. However, the 1 Vietnam division now located north of Tourane would unquestionably be badly mauled. Initiative at the onset, terrain, and disparity of forces makes this inevitable.</p>
<p>D. Tourane hill mass provides excellent terrain to deter or stop forces moving southward along coastal plain. However, theory of “absolute” defense this area believed to be somewhat fallacious and <pb xml:id="pg_710" n="710" facs="0740"/>dangerous. At its narrowest, the frontage along these mountains is 40 miles of rugged jungle covered terrain. The western approaches are not accessible by road and could be easily turned by infiltration tactics of Viet Minh since the wide frontage would virtually preclude any effective degree security this area. Assuming 2 to 3 field divisions of the Vietnamese Army are committed to an all-out fight in the Quang Tri–Tourane area, and if, as is very likely, they are by-passed, contained or otherwise eliminated from the southward progression of the war, then the hard core of the Vietnamese Army will be reduced to holding a beach-head at Tourane. It is difficult to visualize Viet Minh attacking south without well laid plans to rapidly infiltrate large numbers of troops along the protected jungle routes, well inland, where they could eventually debouch in the plateau area north of Kontum and thence part of their forces commence lateral movement to contain any forces committed to the defense of the Tourane hill mass. Commitment of only 1 <gloss target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss> United States troops in this area would hardly alter the situation.</p>
<p>E. Not clear here exactly how forces contemplated in this plan will be enabled to take control of all Vietnam. With United States contributing the equivalent of 1 division of ground troops, the Vietnamese limited to present force basis and slight help to be expected from other Asiatics, the problem of initially stopping and then destroying the Viet Minh field army and then taking over all Vietnam appears somewhat academic. 6 to 8 United States divisions with proper logistic forces would be a more realistic estimate.</p>
<p>F. An important factor which should be remembered is the xenophobia throughout Vietnam which may bolster northern morale and somewhat weaken southern morale upon the intervention of the “Western colonialists”. <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> will again claim to be fighting to drive out the foreigners and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will be called the “puppet” of the West. Psychological factors which induce the will to fight such as his well known xenophobia will require the most careful consideration. An additional one is the effect of the proposed stationing of a Marine <gloss target="#t_RLT1">RLT</gloss> in Saigon. This might well backfire by raising in Vietnamese minds the question as to why United States troops are positioned so far from the fighting. An implication might also be drawn that we expect the war to move rapidly to the Saigon region. On the other hand, it would be well to pass over Saigon whenever possible large numbers of aircraft as evidence of United States modern power that is being brought to bear at critical points.</p>
<p>G. Amongst the tasks listed, that of maintaining United States amphibious lift for 3 Vietnamese divisions in the Saigon area is not understood. The purpose of stationing such a valuable force in the Saigon River, 4 hours from the open sea via a very difficult channel <pb xml:id="pg_711" n="711" facs="0741"/>and for which pilots are scarce, is not clear. Cape Saint Jacques area would be better.</p>
<p>H. Strongly concur in concept of selecting and training United States advisors. Language difficulty alone would appear to negate the possiblity of using Vietnamese for air and naval gunfire coordination and it is assumed that the required <gloss target="#t_TACPS1">TACPS</gloss>, and naval liaison and gunfire spotter teams would be included in 2500 specially trained United States personnel as well as personnel for a <gloss target="#t_JOC1">JOC</gloss>.</p>
<p>I. Communications are and will be critical. Contact with field units will be difficult to establish. Equipment and operators will be needed so that direct communications between United States headquarters and United States advisors in the field can be maintained without going through Vietnamese channels.</p>
<p>Following are my comments on <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> observations:</p>
<p>A. Agree with general principle of paragraph 1, but feel the likelihood of flanking attack through Laos somewhat greater than implied. Rainy season in mountains and on plain are in opposite seasons and one or the other will be wet. The light forces capable of moving through the jungle [garble] roads would be able to move during wet or dry weather.</p>
<p>B. Concur in paragraphs 2 and 3. It may be noted, however, that the Vietnamese troops are still relatively untrained for major operations so that the numbers comparison with the Viet Minh is not necessarily sound. The lack of Vietnamese training, field command structure and logistic balance in effect increases the Viet Minh superiority above the 2 to 1 ratio.</p>
<p>C. Reference paragraph 4, strongly concur that decisive action which strikes at the heart of the problem is highly desirable.</p>
<p>D. Agree that at least 2 divisions of United States troops mentioned in paragraph 5 will be required, but if rapid development in the north is expected, additional United States forces are certainly needed.</p>
<p>E. Agree with your paragraphs 6 thru 10 except for Marine deployment to Saigon. See paragraph 1F above.</p>
<p>The analysis of the problem presented by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> reemphasizes to me the importance of building in South Vietnam an indigenous ground force stronger than now contemplated.</p>

<dateline><hi rend="italic"><placeName>Washington</placeName>, <date when="1956-06-14">June 14, 1956</date></hi>.</dateline>
<p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Felix</persName>: I am inclosing for your information a copy of the “Broad Outline Plan for U.S. Military Participation in the Event of Viet Minh Aggression in Viet Nam” which I presented to the National Security Council on Thursday, 7 June.<note n="2" xml:id="d335fn2"><ref target="#d333">Document 333</ref>.</note> This plan incorporates my concept of operations for the defeat of Viet Minh aggression south of the 17th Parallel. This concept is, in general, the same as I discussed with you during your recent trip here. I also discussed this plan in considerable detail with Mike O’Daniel, who concurs in the concept set forth in the plan.</p>
<p>The plan was quite well received by the National Security Council and was approved by the President. Implementation of this decision is now underway by the Joint Staff, and a planning directive<note n="3" xml:id="d335fn3">Memorandum from the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>, July 11, 1956; cited in Spector, <hi rend="italic">The Early Years,</hi> p. 272.</note> is being prepared which will incorporate the concept of operations contained in this Outline Plan.</p>
<p>I have seen both your comments on my plan<note n="4" xml:id="d335fn4">See <ref target="#d329">Document 329</ref>.</note> and a draft of your plan (<gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> 49–56)<note n="5" xml:id="d335fn5">Not found. For a discussion of <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> 46–56, the contingency plan as adopted in the fall of 1956, see Spector, <hi rend="italic">The Early Years,</hi> p. 272.</note> and note there are basic differences in the two concepts which I am sure you will recognize. Since your plan will, in effect, be overtaken by the planning directive to be issued you as a result of the decision by the President, I think it would be desirable to give you some of the thinking behind this plan, and certain additional information not contained in my presentation.</p>
<p>This plan is designed to be implemented on a very austere basis, and with forces immediately available in WesPac. This is a point that I am quite concerned about since it has been my experience that unless you keep a critical eye on them, your staff logistic people will come up with a plush set of logistic requirements, particularly in supporting troops. This will apply not only to U.S. forces, but also to the Viet Nam forces. An example of this type of thinking is the statement made by <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> during our discussion of this plan, that the three <gloss target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss>’s would require a division slice of 40,000. We must learn to conduct this type of operation with tailored forces and on a minimum support basis, and this applies particularly to indigenous forces.</p>
<p>Another aspect of this concept which is most important and does not appear in the presentation, is that of having the commanders <pb xml:id="pg_713" n="713" facs="0743"/>of the <gloss target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss>’s that are earmarked for this operation sent to Viet Nam to look over the terrain and to acquaint themselves with the tactical setup. They should be accompanied by their staffs and the battalion commanders, and should be authorized to discuss tactical problems and plans with the Vietnamese commanders. Similarly, the air unit commanders should familiarize themselves and their staffs with the bases to which they may be deployed. Not only would this provide invaluable information to these commanders, but the impact on the Vietnamese would be tremendous.</p>
<p>I have seen <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName>’ comments on the Outline Plan (<gloss target="#t_ChMAAG1">ChMAAG</gloss> Vietnam 070701Z June<note n="6" xml:id="d335fn6"><hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note>) and if this really represents his considered thinking on the military aspects of this area, I have grave doubts as to his ability and as to his being a proper representative in this important area. His comments are typical of the “requirements” type of thinking that is giving us so much trouble everywhere. I won’t attempt to comment on his message other than to say he has completely missed the point of the concept. I intend to discuss this whole matter with you in detail when you come back here next month.</p>
<p>I am delighted that you were able to revise the date for the Cubi Point commissioning and am looking forward to being there.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p rend="right"><hi rend="strong">Raddy</hi><note n="7" xml:id="d335fn7">Printed from a copy with this stamped signature.</note></p>
<p>P.S. Any action you initiate as a result of this letter should come from you and not using the letter itself. I am really giving you this for your personal use because I felt that the Navy Brief of my concept was not a good one.</p>

<dateline><hi rend="italic"><placeName>Washington</placeName>, <date when="1956-06-21">21 June 1956</date></hi>.</dateline>
<p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Walter</persName>: In a letter of 1 May 1956,<note n="2" xml:id="d336fn2"><ref target="#d321">Document 321</ref></note> Deputy Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> restated the basic terms of reference for the Temporary <pb xml:id="pg_714" n="714" facs="0744"/>Equipment Recovery Mission (<gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss>) Viet-Nam, and requested a reply from the Department of Defense summarizing our views on the subject.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense agrees with the views of the Department of State regarding the functions of <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss>, namely:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) Supervising the recovery (identification, inventory and accounting control) of <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> equipment in Viet-Nam, including out-shipment of excess; and</item>
<item>(b) Assisting in the improvement of Viet-Nam logistic capabilities.</item>
</list>
<p>We have been concerned over the apparent desire of the International Control Commission to exercise detailed supervision of <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> operations. Such control, if permitted, would jeopardize the entire operation and provide the Communist members with valuable information on Vietnamese military operations. Therefore, the <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> responsibilities of preparing information for submission through the Vietnamese Government to the Commission should at most be limited to (a) general summaries on outshipment and inshipment and (b) brief statements regarding numbers and names of U.S. military personnel assigned to <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss>.<note n="3" xml:id="d336fn3"><persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName>’ views on these matters are set forth in his memorandum to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> dated June 3. (Center of Military History, <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName> Papers, Memos to and from Ambassador 1955–1956 (6))</note></p>
<p>Prior to the arrival of the first contingent of <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> approximately $100 million of <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> Indochina assets had already been shipped from Viet-Nam. In establishing the basic records, it is most important that the United States be credited with this amount. Such credit will provide a basis for shipments into Viet-Nam within the provisions of the Geneva Agreements of 1954.</p>
<p>Although the establishment of <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> meets the requirements for American military logistic personnel in Viet-Nam during the coming months, there is still a deficiency of military personnel for combat training. The Chief, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Viet-Nam, in submitting his minimum requirements last February asked for approximately 300 military personnel in addition to the numbers authorized for <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss>. We recognize that it would not be appropriate at this time to add the combat training officers to the present <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> strength. It may become necessary some time within the next twelve months, however, to reconsider this entire problem.<note n="4" xml:id="d336fn4">Next to this paragraph is a marginal note in an unidentified hand which reads “Next request coming up.”</note></p>
<p>One half of the 350 military personnel authorized for <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> are now in Viet-Nam. The remaining two contingents will be sent to Viet-Nam in early July and early August. The Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> has informed <pb xml:id="pg_715" n="715" facs="0745"/>us that the provisions regarding the wearing of civilian clothing wherever practicable are in effect.</p>
<p>I suggest that the administrative questions raised in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>’s letter of May 1 be jointly considered by appropriate representatives of our two departments as soon as possible. Our office is prepared to meet with your representatives on these matters as soon as you wish.</p>

<p>92. Joint Embassy/<gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> message. Subject: New <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> land reform program.</p>
<p>1. Tuesday afternoon, July 5, <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Barrows</persName> and I were summoned to presidency to participate in discussions new <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> program for purchase from landowners and distribution to tenants of approximately one million hectares rice land South Vietnam. Present on Vietnamese side in addition to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> were <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LW1">Ladejinsky</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d337fn2"><persName corresp="#p_LW1">Ladejinsky</persName> had resigned as a <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> consultant and was a consultant on land reform to the Republic of Vietnam.</note></p>
<p>2. President opened discussion by announcing that after considerable study he had concluded <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> should launch program to buy and sell to tenants on crop credit terms substantial portion agricultural land South Vietnam. He pointed out that South Vietnam, unlike Central Vietnam, is a region dominated by large landholders. Most peasants who actually farm land are tenants so poor and propertyless as to constitute real proletariat. Many landlords on other hand are indifferent to rights and wishes tenants and have in past taken almost feudal attitude. Even today difference in outlook between landholders and tenants has created atmosphere tension and hostility making it virtually impossible to apply terms existing land reform regulations defining landlord–tenant relationships. Landlords generally dissatisfied with regulations giving them only 15 to 25 percent crop. On other hand, in many areas landlords could not personally collect any rent without risking their lives.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_716" n="716" facs="0746"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s appraisal this situation, based to considerable degree upon examination problem by bis [?] lead to conclusion that only solution is land purchase and distribution.</p>
<p>3. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> then asked <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> outline government plan. <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> gave statistics showing that in South Vietnam 45 percent of land, or nearly one million hectares in properties 50 hectares or larger distributed among 6,000 owners. At other extreme 183,000 owners having each 5 hectares or less possess total 262,000 hectares, or 12-1/2 percent. Government proposes set maximum limit for land holdings somewhere between 60 and 200 hectares, final limit to be determined by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> study commission. All holdings in excess limit will be bought by government under proposed distribution program. Estimate this will make available 750,000 to one million hectares.</p>
<p>4. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> estimates price from 15,000 to 5,000 piasters per hectare. Average figure 7,000 piasters per hectare used in estimating total cost program 7,000,000,000 piasters or US $200,000,000. Will pay landlords 10 to 15 percent in cash (letter from <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Barrows</persName>, July 6,<note n="3" xml:id="d337fn3">Not found.</note> and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s presentation to Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName><note n="4" xml:id="d337fn4">See <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</note> raises this to 15 to 20 percent), remainder to be paid in negotiable government securities redeemable ten to fifteen years. Tenants expected pay for land in five years but will be charged no interest. Landlords will be paid interest on outstanding bonds at rate not yet determined.</p>
<p>5. <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> concluded presentation by asking US loan or grant of 10 to 20 million dollars to finance down payments under program. (This figure increased in July 6 letter to <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Barrows</persName> and in letter to Vice President<note n="5" xml:id="d337fn5">A text of the memorandum handed Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> on July 6 is enclosed with despatch 7 from Saigon, July 12. (Department of State, Central Files, 851G.00/7–1256)</note> to 20 to 30 million dollars.) <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> also asked for some form US guarantee of the proposed securities.</p>
<p>6. In response <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s introductory statement, I expressed agreement with objectives President seeks achieve and said US has long felt that well-conceived and well-administered land reform program involving the redistribution of land ownership would be desirable politically and economically. In course <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName>’s presentation, however, I raised certain questions which plan seems to leave unanswered. I asked, for example, whether price to be paid by farmer expected cover administrative expenses program. Gained impression that it was not. I asked whether government’s calculations showed that farmers who received land would have enough income to pay for it at average cost 7,000 piasters per hectare in five years. Using farmer estimate rice yields, a little arithmetic showed that plan might take <pb xml:id="pg_717" n="717" facs="0747"/>50 percent farmers crop. This problem was disposed of by statement that these details would be worked out by government commission.</p>
<p>7. I then asked what use the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would make of the dollars if provided. <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> said at first unable grasp the question. He said that they will support payments to land owners. We then explained that the landlords would receive piasters whereas the aid or loan, if provided, would be in dollars. How would the dollars be used to generate piasters or offset effect their use? <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> said they will be put in bank.</p>
<p>8. We then pointed out it would be hard justify loan dollars in such case and said that under ordinary circumstances dollars would have to be spent for additional commercial imports. Since this seemed inconsistent with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> recent criticism aid program,<note n="6" xml:id="d337fn6"><p>The reference is to criticism expressed in an undated memorandum by the Vietnamese Ambassador in Washington which was left with the Department on June 19. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName> criticized the U.S. aid program for its alleged dependence on importation of consumer goods into Vietnam. He suggested a new emphasis on local, Vietnamese-controlled industrialization; specifically he requested two sugar mills, a vegetable oil processing plant, a cotton mill, a fertilizer plant, two paper mills, and a team of experts to survey hydroelectrical power. A text of the memorandum is in telegram 4171 to Saigon, June 27. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.5–MSP/6–2756)</p>
<p>After querying <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> about the memorandum, <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> reported to Washington that it did not represent the clear and considered views of the Government of Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> added, however, that <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName>’s criticism and call for industrialization had wide appeal in South Vietnam. To the American Ambassador’s mind, such a theme was economically dangerous and inconsistent with the main line of action of the economic policy of the Government of Vietnam. (Telegram 45 from Saigon, July 3; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 751G.5–MSP/7–556)</p></note> we asked whether <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> willing to link landlords down payments to use for importation capital goods. <persName corresp="#p_LW1">Ladejinsky</persName> objected, evidently on ground would make plan unacceptable most landlords, and recommended use dollars for commercial imports.</p>
<p>9. As discussion progressed, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> again stated his reasons for feeling the program necessary and talked at length of inequities of feudal land holding system in the south. He recalled number instances harsh and unjust actions by landlords and of the hostilities they had provoked among tenants. Said that as early as 1950, rural proletariat in richer parts Mekong delta had become focus Communist sentiment.</p>
<p>10. In conclusion, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> indicated would present paper to Vice President outlining plan and requesting financial assistance. I said we could not comment on possibility obtaining additional aid or a loan for this purpose but believe that when a complete and practicable plan had been worked out, it should be possible to resolve monetary and budgetary problems.</p>
<p>11. In conversation with Vice President July 6, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> made much the same presentation as in meeting reported here. Only significant <pb xml:id="pg_718" n="718" facs="0748"/>new idea was that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said he wished announce land reform on July 20. Hoped therefore have our answer to request for assistance before that time.</p>
<p>12. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> also gave Vice President memorandum this subject. Copy being forwarded separately.</p>

<p>95. 1. Vice President visit Saigon went off according to plan (Saigon’s 38 July 3<note n="2" xml:id="d338fn2"><p>Telegram 38 from Saigon, July 3, contained a detailed schedule for Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>’s trip to South Vietnam.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>’s visit to Vietnam, July 6–7, was part of a larger Far East trip, the primary purpose of which was to attend the tenth anniversary celebrations of the Government of the Philippines. After leaving Saigon, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> traveled to the Republic of China, Thailand, Pakistan, and Turkey. Documentation on the trip is <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> Conference Files: Lot 62 D 181, CF 729A.</p></note>) except that inclement weather rendered impractical overflight Caisam resettlement project. Govt and people very pleased with visit, and today’s press full of laudatory comment being reported separately. Vietnamese particularly impressed by Vice President’s informal and cordial manner which they feel good omen for continuing friendly relationship between two countries.</p>
<p>2. In private conversation with Vice President afternoon July 6, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> mentioned in passing importance of developing industrial capacity of country as well as good use he could make of augmented military forces, but he devoted major part of interview to exposition of his new plan for agrarian reform which had been subject of previous day’s conversation with <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Barrows</persName> and me (<gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 92<note n="3" xml:id="d338fn3"><hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note>). He handed me Vice President’s memorandum on subject which is being forwarded by pouch. Apart from slight amendments of details, principal differences in plan as presented July 5th and July 6th were that total US assistance requested was now from twenty to thirty million dollars, and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> expressed desire to be in position to announce project on July 20. Vice President expressed sympathy with plan in principle but added technical feasibility and details would of course have to be discussed by two govts.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_719" n="719" facs="0749"/>
<p>3. When I saw <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> this afternoon, July 9, he reiterated his gratification at Vice President’s visit and expressed deep appreciation for President’s message<note n="4" xml:id="d338fn4">Text of this letter, June 29, which was entirely congratulatory and ceremonial, is in telegram 8 to Saigon, July 2. (Department of State, Central Files, 711.11–EI/7–256)</note> which he said had given him and Vietnamese encouragement for future.</p>
<p>4. I raised with him subject of agrarian reform project and suggested plan to make announcement by July 20 was unfeasible. Although I felt sure Washington would be sympathetic to project in principle, nevertheless much more detailed and exhaustive study of problem and method of implementation would be necessary. Both preparation of such study as well as its analysis in Washington would take some time. I added it was my personal feeling there was psychological advantage in not using July 2 [<hi rend="italic">20</hi>] date for political pronunciamentos and that he could have no greater political success at moment than an uneventful and serene July 20. Finally, I suggested that new agrarian reform law which would have far reaching economic and social implications would be most appropriate subject for new Assembly to deal with. Reaction both here and abroad would be much better if such reform could be launched by legislature rather than by simple fiat. He did not argue point in principle but expressed misgivings as to new Assembly’s ability to cope with such difficult problem in reasonable time. He admitted that July 20 was apparently not feasible date to announce agrarian reform project but left without comment my general suggestion July 20 was not best day for political pronunciamentos.</p>

All members of the Intelligence Advisory Committee—with the exception of the representatives of the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> who abstained, the subject being outside their jurisdiction—concurred in the estimate on July 17.</note></p>
<p rend="center">The Problem</p>
<p>To analyze the current political, economic, and military situation in North and South Vietnam and to estimate probable developments through mid-1957.</p>
<p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
<p>1. We believe that the Communist “Democratic Republic of Vietnam” (<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>) will not attempt an open invasion of South Vietnam or a large scale guerrilla warfare effort during the period of this estimate because of the danger of US or possibly <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> counteraction and because such action would prejudice Bloc emphasis on peaceful coexistence elsewhere. The Communist regime will almost certainly remain in firm political control throughout the period of this estimate, despite some passive resistance and serious economic difficulties. It will require continued large scale Bloc aid to make even limited progress toward developing a self-supporting economy. The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> army will retain the capability of defeating the total forces of South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. (Paras. 7–11, 13–16, 18–21, 64–68)</p>
<p>2. In South Vietnam, the trend toward political stability and popular confidence in the government will probably continue, barring a <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> invasion, large scale guerrilla action, or the death of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. Nevertheless, such contingent developments as intensified Bloc support for <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> objectives or reduction in <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s international support could stimulate greater Communist subversive pressure, weaken the South Vietnam government’s confidence, cause some loss of its public support, and revive opposition efforts for reconciliation with the north. (Paras. 35–39, 69–72)</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_721" n="721" facs="0751"/>
<p>3. Progress toward resolving basic economic problems will probably continue slow, but economic conditions in South Vietnam are not likely to have serious adverse political effects during the next year, as rice production, rubber exports, and large scale US aid provide reasonable living standards. (Paras. 40–46)</p>
<p>4. All significant sect resistance in South Vietnam has been eliminated, but some 8,000–10,000 armed Communists and a Communist political network scattered through the villages continue to pose a serious internal security problem. The effectiveness of the South Vietnam army will probably improve gradually as more units are released from security missions for training, but by mid–1957 it will still be unable to contain a <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> attack for a prolonged period. (Paras. 47–56)</p>

<p>“State and <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> concur position you have taken re new land reform project including your statements to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> on timing of announcement, possible role National Assembly this matter, and need for much more exhaustive study.</p>

<p>1. Further study land reform proposals presented by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> demonstrates clearly these proposals poorly conceived and poorly timed. Unfortunately their author failed inform <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> Director or me soon enough beforehand to influence either timing or content. We first heard of them . . . without being informed they would be presented to Vice President. Author admits <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has not developed land reform program, yet we are faced with immediate request for $30 million U.S. dollar aid for land redistribution program which at best could not start being implemented in less than one year. Moreover, propriety use U.S. dollar aid to finance <pb xml:id="pg_722" n="722" facs="0752"/>transfer land from one Vietnamese to another highly questionable, particularly at this time when joint U.S./Vietnamese program efforts are directed at maximizing economic development. Present proposals would require $30 million extra commercial imports to produce piasters needed to finance down payments to landlords by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_LW1">Ladejinsky</persName> himself opposed such use U.S. aid when employed by <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>.</p>
<p>2. Ministry Agrarian Reform has not been brought into picture and evidently will not be until future present Minister Thoi is decided. Thoi has stated to <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> Assistant Director Lavergne that he does not consider proposed plan adequately thought out, doubts its practicability, and said he would not wish be responsible for its administration. Has even asserted that <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> (his half-brother) does not really believe in program but has assumed responsibility for it out of loyalty to President. While some of Thoi’s criticisms have merit, he is probably motivated in part by strong but heretofore withheld animosity towards <persName corresp="#p_LW1">Ladejinsky</persName>. (<persName corresp="#p_LW1">Ladejinsky</persName>, who worked with Thoi for more than year while serving as land reform advisor on <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> staff, has long criticized and mistrusted Thoi and has recently criticized him openly. Whether this accounts for President’s lack confidence in Thoi, Thoi feels he does not have President’s confidence and that <persName corresp="#p_LW1">Ladejinsky</persName>’s attitude is important factor this respect.)</p>
<p>3. <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Barrows</persName> discussed proposals with <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> calling attention fact that present Ministry Agrarian Reform is supported almost wholly from counterpart funds, but that in program review now underway <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> authorities have accorded only second priority to continuation this support. <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> also was asked how <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> intended administer new program, urged that qualified person of ministerial rank, free of all other responsibilities, be assigned task directing program. Services offered of Price Gittinger, land reform specialist on <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> staff, and suggestion made that additional help be obtained from field project staff <gloss target="#t_MSUG1">MSUG</gloss> which has just completed study land reform organization. Budgetary and financial problem presented by land reform proposal also discussed briefly, with suggestion some financial assistance might be obtained from unprogrammed 1955 counterpart funds. <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> received these suggestions with interest and appreciation, indicated he did not know what permanent arrangements <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would make for program but assumed that he (<persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName>) would continue to handle it for time being. Since then <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> has not asked for help either from Mission or from <gloss target="#t_MSUG1">MSUG</gloss>.</p>
<p>4. <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> representatives have also had several discussions plan with <persName corresp="#p_LW1">Ladejinsky</persName> since Vice President’s visit. These conversations have confirmed fact that <persName corresp="#p_LW1">Ladejinsky</persName> indeed author of plan. He not only wrote letter presented by President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, but I am satisfied he also conceived and sold basic idea to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> first through Bishop Thuc and later directly. <persName corresp="#p_LW1">Ladejinsky</persName> recognizes <pb xml:id="pg_723" n="723" facs="0753"/>proposal is only outline and that much additional planning must be done to develop practicable program. In effort persuade <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> develop its ideas further, <persName corresp="#p_LW1">Ladejinsky</persName> recently wrote long memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> outlining program of action and has had at least two conversations on subject. Thus far <persName corresp="#p_LW1">Ladejinsky</persName>’s efforts have not been more fruitful than <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>’s. <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> apparently has limited his action to assigning to one staff member of Ministry Economy without previous experience this field task preparing land reform statute based on reading similar laws other countries.</p>
<p>5. <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> confirmed fact <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> request for financial support land reform program is for aid in addition to that provided for regular military and economic purposes. Moreover, <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> 1957 proposals now under review include no additional funds for support land reform even in <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> economic program totaling $130 million.</p>
<p>6. Have explored tentatively idea linking funds for land reform to program capital imports. This could be done, for example, by depositing landlords’ down payments in blocked accounts from which funds released only to pay for approved capital goods imports. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> reaction this idea is somewhat vague but favorable according <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName>’s statement national aid committee meeting July 19 reported separately.</p>
<p>7. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials have not given serious thought to fact that even with American aid for initial payments to landlords, proposed program will still constitute serious budgetary burden. On basis present sketchy program, it is impossible make firm estimates cost, but following items at least can be identified: (a) administrative expenses; (b) interest on bonds given landlords for amount of purchase price not covered by down payment (present plan seems count on paying interest to landlords but not charging interest to tenants); (c) losses on collection.</p>
<p>8. Notwithstanding all doubts and questions herein expressed, we face fact <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has come forward with land reform proposals. He has made proposals contingent upon our financial support. If we refuse financial support, he will have good excuse for doing nothing this field. He may also be very much let down, because he very likely feels that in reacting positively to advice he has received from <persName corresp="#p_LW1">Ladejinsky</persName>, he has been doing what U.S. wishes. In circumstances, therefore, I believe we must give very serious consideration this request.</p>
<p>9. Apart from economic and administrative aspects, I am concerned over political implications of premature announcement of land redistribution program which may become only partially effective. I am, therefore, inclined to discuss subject once more with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> before making definitive recommendations with respect to U.S. financing, <pb xml:id="pg_724" n="724" facs="0754"/>but would wish state U.S. Govt’s position more or less as follows:</p>
<p>We are gratified <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has determined to embark on land redistribution program and wish help in every way to make it both political and economical success. Should be recognized, however, that such program long-range and could only be implemented effectively after considerable preparation. From political standpoint much could be gained in clarifying issues and gaining public acceptance through parliamentary action. In any event we question political desirability premature public announcement.</p>
<p>From economic standpoint dollar aid requested would perforce augment commercial aid program since resulting piasters, not dollars, needed to assist financing land transfers. Moreover, since unlikely program could develop sufficiently as to require financing in less than year, we would prefer consider request from <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 rather than <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957 U.S. appropriations. Also, we agree such financing would be more suitable on loan than grant basis and, as recently suggested by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, should be used for capital imports to assist in developing industry. Piasters to finance these imports to maximum extent possible should be derived from private investment to minimize inflationary impact on economy.

Secret. Drafted by Lieutenant Colonel Vincent Usera, USA, of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, the interpreter.</note></head>
<p>1. At 1030 hours, this date, <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> was called to see the President. He was accompanied by Lt. Col. Usera as interpreter.</p>
<p>2. The President asked <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> what he thought of the road situation after his trip. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> intimated that he was still of the same opinion as expressed in the last conversation but that he still felt there would be considerable difficulty in selling the program to <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>. The President remarked that the Minister of Public Works was now completely in accord with the paper as submitted to <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> and he called attention to the fact that the Minister of Public Works had signed alongside the Assistant Secretary of National Defense. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> suggested that <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> should be interested in the proposed roads in view of the economic impact of these roads. As an example, he cited the fact that there was much unemployment in central Vietnam and that work on the project roads would give jobs to many of these unemployed thus relieving the situation, in addition to assisting in opening up new lands for cultivation.</p>
<p>3. The President then asked <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> what he would suggest be taken up in a conversation with <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d341fn2"><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> was in Vietnam July 26–27 as part of a trip through East and Southeast Asia. See <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</note> <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> suggested that the first thing should be the question of roads. Another question which <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> suggested was the political situation in Laos and Cambodia which he felt was generally known in Washington, but to which the President could add much of his personal knowledge of particular situations as they affected Vietnam. A third suggestion made by <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> was that the President also discuss the Force Levels including those of the Navy and Air Force. The last subject suggested by <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> to be taken up with <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> was the matter of the Naval Arsenal at Saigon. The President made notes of these suggestions.</p>
<p>4. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> stated that he had three things which had been mentioned by <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> which he would like to briefly discuss with the President. The first question was the desire of <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> to send over within one or two months, some of the Unit Commanders who might be involved in command responsibilities in case of intervention by allied forces in Vietnam. These unit commanders and key staff members would discuss definite problems with senior Vietnamese <pb xml:id="pg_726" n="726" facs="0756"/>Commanders, on the spot, in order to arrive at a closer understanding of the problems involved. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> explained that this should come after the return of the reconnaissance teams presently in Vietnam. After these teams made their report, there would probably be planning undertaken in Hawaii and after these tentative plans were finished, then the commanders and their staffs would come to Vietnam to discuss them with the Vietnamese Commanders. The President agreed that this was desirable.</p>
<p>5. The second thing the <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General</persName> wished to bring to the attention of the President was the present planning figure of over 2,000 advisors for the Vietnamese Armed Forces in case of war. He explained to the President that this was based on similar proportion of advisors as existed in Korea during the active fighting in that country. The <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General</persName> also stated that these personnel would be trained here in Vietnam and then returned to their home stations where they would be available in case of war for immediate assignment within the Armed Forces of Vietnam. The President agreed to this concept.</p>
<p>6. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> then took up the third question posed by <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> which was the matter of command relationship between the allied forces and the local Vietnamese forces. He explained to President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that the concept of a unified command was a long standing American military tradition. It had been accepted in World War I; it had been accepted in Africa and Normandy in World War II; it had been accepted in Korea in 1950. The <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General</persName> asked the President what he thought of this matter and the President answered that “in principle” he was in favor of a unified command but that he wished to see some sort of schematic plan for this command before accepting it in total. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> explained that it was necessary to look up [<hi rend="italic">at</hi>] the matter from the viewpoint of morale and propaganda value in both South Vietnam and North Vietnam. He went on to state that just yesterday he had interviewed a group of priests and nuns who had just escaped ten days ago from North Vietnam and landed in Quang Tri. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> asked if they had given him any information and the President answered that the information was actually much better than he would have expected. He stated that in the case of the escape of this group they had had active assistance from the Secret Police and the Surveillance Police in North Vietnam. The President stated that the priests were all unanimous in their belief that the continuous naming of President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in the propaganda broadcasts of the Vietminh had boomeranged. As an example, the Vietminh propaganda line that President [<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>] had chased out the French only to replace them with the Americans had caused a great deal of favorable response from those hearers who were impressed with the fact that he had managed to shake off the French yoke. As a result, the President continued, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> is <pb xml:id="pg_727" n="727" facs="0757"/>getting to be better known in the North than he is in the South. The President stated that he had questioned the women, who were simple country folk, as to the fidelity of the Armed Forces towards the regime and the women responded that the Armed Forces were pretty well indoctrinated and received such preferential treatment that it was doubtful if there would be any significant defection on their part. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said that he questioned the priests as to what would happen if the Vietnamese were to make a raid, perhaps in Vinh, not with any intention of staying but only as a simple raid. He stated that the party all agreed that the population of Vinh would leave, en masse, with the Vietnamese soldiers if such an attack were to occur. The President went on to state that the matter of command relationship was therefore a delicate one which required consideration of the public reaction in North Vietnam as well as in Free Vietnam. He related that he was in favor of a unified command, in principle.</p>
<p>7. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> suggested that, if an allied attack Came, it might be better to divert the attack towards Laos in order to outflank the Vietminh forces and threaten their borders. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> mentioned the fact that an allied force would probably be composed of Americans, Australians, Philippinos and other members of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> called attention to the fact that the use of Siamese to attack through Laos would not be very wise. He felt that the Siamese soldier would have considerable difficulty in passing over the mountain barrier into the Vietminh territory. In addition, the President called the <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General</persName>’s attention to the fact that the Laotians were very afraid of the Siamese and that the Siamese, if they ever came into Laos, would make trouble by looting and pillaging. He also remarked that the Siamese have a long standing claim to Laos which they consider ethnically a part of Siam and that once they entered Laos it might be difficult to get them out of there. The President went on to explain, at long length, how the Vietnamese for many centuries had protected Laotians against encroachment by the Siamese and the Chinese. He also pointed out that in 1884, when the French took over the Protectorate of Annam, the border was fixed at the Mekong River for Vietnam. Later, when the British incited the Siamese to attack in Indochina, the Vietnamese came to the assistance of the Laotians and drove out the invaders easily. At a conference in London in 1893, it was again established that the Vietnamese border would be the Mekong River.</p>
<p>8. The President mentioned the fact that Laos was showing a distinct tendency towards neutralism and that the United States Government should attack this problem diplomatically in order to keep Laos on the side of the Free World. He suggested that the best way to achieve this would be by getting Laos into <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and that, <pb xml:id="pg_728" n="728" facs="0758"/>as a bait, the United States Diplomatic Mission might use the development of the rich area about Savanna Khet. This area could be opened for development by the opening of the road from Dong Ha westward through Laos to Savanna Khet. He pointed out that in a country as poor as Laos this could constitute a real economic future.</p>
<p>9. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> mentioned that he had received several notes from the Secretary of Defense which were to be presented to the President, and that in one of them, he had noticed an error in facts. In the note relative to the reorganization of the Vietnamese Forces on the 150,000 level, there was mention of a decrease in artillery strength to six battalions whereas the truth of the matter was that the artillery would be increased and not decreased.</p>
<p>10. The interview ended at 1220 hours.<note n="3" xml:id="d341fn3"><persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName> reported on this conversation in telegram <gloss target="#t_MAGCH1">MAGCH</gloss> 4242 from Saigon to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> in Pearl Harbor, July 25 (259345Z).

<p>4. The President asked <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> if his trip had been a pleasant one and the <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral</persName> responded that he had had a very fine flight. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> brought up the subject of strategic roads and he explained at some length the advantages of placing the primary emphasis on roads in the High Plateau in preference to the roads along the coast. He pointed out that the main advantage of the roads along the coastal plain (Route Number 1) was the fact that the population centers were on the coastal plain, but that the coastal plain was overpopulated and land was becoming very difficult to come by. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> asked if there was no free land left and the President answered that he had distributed a small amount of remaining land among the refugees and that the only other land, outside of the High Plateau, was rocky and sandy soil which was not fit for cultivation. The President stated that industrialization of the coastal plain would solve this problem but unfortunately, there were no large mineral deposits available which would make industrialization possible in that area, therefore, the only answer was exploitation of the immense land area in the High Plateau. He called the <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral</persName>’s attention to the fact that the French since the end of World War I had aimed all of their policies at the exploitation of this area in the High Plateau. The President went on to explain that in the High Plateau, there were great possibilities for fruit trees, coffee, rubber, corn and even some rice area. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> told the President that he would assist in every way possible in obtaining these roads for Vietnam. The President went on to point out the strategic advantages of the roads recommended by him and the overall importance of east-west roads which would open up highways westward towards the Plains of Laos and Thailand. He explained the French and Japanese pre-occupation within the same strategic concept which he considered just as valid for Vietnam.</p>
<p>5. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> stated that politically, Laos was in a precarious position of falling into the hands of the neutralists and that the United States must assist diplomatically in orienting the Laotians towards <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> in order to permit Laos to [come to?] the defense of Southeast Asia. He pointed out that the Laotians were militarily insignificant but that their territory, if at the disposal of the free peoples, could be of great assistance. The President stated that if an attack were to be launched northwards, Viet Minh would undoubtedly use the “scorched earth” policy of moving the coastal population westward to the mountains and that these people, most of whom are Christians, would undoubtedly infiltrate through Laos towards South Vietnam. He also remarked that Laos, if it were on our side, would constitute a threat to the Viet Minh flank. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> asked if relations between Laos and Vietnam had been normalized, and the President stated that just five days ago the two countries <pb xml:id="pg_730" n="730" facs="0760"/>had agreed to exchanging diplomatic representatives and that the Vietnamese were presently trying to rent a building for the Legation at Vientiane.</p>
<p>6. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> then asked the President what the situation was with his other neighbor, Cambodia. The President answered that the Cambodians were all capricious and historically were unfriendly to all of their neighbors. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> asked if all of the Cambodians were capricious and the President stated that all their leading government personnel were capricious. He pointed out that Prince Shihanouk was suffering from a complex due to the fact that he knew he was not the legitimate successor to the Dynasty. In 1942 the French had placed him on the Throne instead of the rightful successor because the Chief of the French Sûreté in Indochina had felt that Shihanouk would be safer than the legitimate Heir and would not sell out to the Japanese. Shihanouk, he stated, was a demigod [<hi rend="italic">demagogue</hi>?] who wanted to make himself popular with the masses because of his feeling of insecurity. The Prince had then decided to place his father on the Throne and he made himself the Prime Minister. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> asked if the legitimate heir was still alive. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> stated that the legitimate heir was alive but that he had to cooperate with the usurping branch of the Dynasty because the only opposition was a party which was dedicated to the overthrow of the Dynasty and replacing it with a Republic. The President pointed out that Shihanouk was playing a very dangerous game and that he had accepted the aid offered by Red China thinking that he could play off Red China and Russia against each other while he benefited from aid both from Red China and the United States. In imitation of India, he had visited Peiping and was playing the neutralist game to the hilt. The President mentioned the fact that the money given by Red China had gone to assist mostly the large Chinese Colony in Cambodia and that the police in that country were hard put to control the activities of this Chinese element which contained a large proportion of Red Chinese sympathizers. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> asked the President if he had any recent intelligence from North Vietnam and the President made mention of the group of thirty refugees led by several Catholic priests and nuns who had arrived in Vietnam some twelve days ago and whom he had interviewed at the Palace. He repeated the information given <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> in the conversations of the 24th of July.<note n="2" xml:id="d342fn2">See <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note></p>
<p>7. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> brought up the subject of French Military Missions and asked <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> whether the Vietnamese could expect more assistance from the United States in this matter. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> explained to <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> that the President meant assistance <pb xml:id="pg_731" n="731" facs="0761"/>in furnishing Navy and Air Force Advisers. The President agreed that this was what he meant. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> went on to explain that he was reluctant to have the French Missions in the Navy and Air Force because of the influence these people might try to exert. He pointed out that the Vietnamese had three hundred military students in France and that he had given orders for these students to finish their course but that no more students will go to France in the future. The President explained that the Viet Minh Cultural Mission in France was exerting considerable pressure against these students to obtain the services of this trained personnel and that he felt there was serious danger of indoctrinated elements remaining in the Vietnamese Navy and Air Force because of this indoctrination. The President stated that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HH1">Hoppenot</persName> had asked him recently why he requested a French Military Mission when he refused to send students to France. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HH1">Hoppenot</persName> asked the President whether it was his intention to keep the French Mission only long enough for it to be replaced by the Americans. The President stated that he told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HH1">Hoppenot</persName> that his reason for not sending students to France was because the Viet Minh were propagandizing these young sailors and airmen right under the noses of the French Security elements and that he did not desire to have sabotage in his Navy and Air Force. He pointed out to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HH1">Hoppenot</persName> that this was not a case of being anti-French; it was simply self-defense against communist machinations. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> told the <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral</persName> that recently twenty-two graduates of large French Universities had been talked into going with the Viet Minh after they finished their technical education and that there had even been some of the Military desert to the Viet Minh. He felt that this situation was dangerous because there were in France a total of five thousand Vietnamese students who were receiving francs for their education in France and that this large number could easily harbor saboteurs and traitors amongst them.</p>
<p>8. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> stated that he wanted to have the French Missions under the control of the Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and that he wanted to limit the French Mission to a period of six months but the French had refused to accept any period less than one year. He stated that since the negotiations were practically finished he would like to know if the Americans could furnish the Mission so that he could turn down the French. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> stated that this was too late to do this at the present. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> asked whether it would not be possible to bring American civilians and attach them perhaps to the Air Vietnam for the purpose of training Vietnamese pilots. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> stated that this was possible but he felt the situation would better itself as more and more students went to the United States for training and returned to Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> asked <pb xml:id="pg_732" n="732" facs="0762"/>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> whether he felt there was any hope that the ceiling of 342 could be ignored in the near future. The Ambassador stated that he felt sure this could happen sometime in the future but he called <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName>’ attention to the fact that this ceiling was now 700 men.<note n="3" xml:id="d342fn3">Apparent reference to the combined <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> ceiling of 692.</note> <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> explained to <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> and the Ambassador that ever since his arrival the Vietnamese have been anxious to get rid of the French Military and replace them with Americans but that we had always forced the Vietnamese into accepting French Naval and Air Advisers for some reason unknown to him and because of the unrealistic limit imposed by the Geneva Accords. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> turned to the President and stated that it was necessary, first of all that the Mission be limited to the least time possible and second, that supervision of the training be assured to make certain that the training was adequate. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> went on to say that this formula must be in black and white so that the French would not balk later on. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName> stated that the French would accept nothing less than one year for their Missions and that they had so stated on several occasions. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> stated that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HH1">Hoppenot</persName> had agreed with him on the idea of a Committee chairmanned by the Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> as the controlling element for the Missions. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> repeated that it was necessary that this be clearly defined in any agreement or protocol arrived at. N.B. It is to be noted that the present Protocol for the French Military Missions does not contain any reference to this Committee controlling the Missions.</p>
<p>9. At 1905 <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> and his Party and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> left Independence Palace to dress for dinner and return at 2030 hours.</p>

<p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> felt that the overall situation in Vietnam has continued to improve. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and his top leaders are perhaps less aware of the progress made, and more sensitive to the problems still confronting them, because they live closer to the situation than an observer from far away. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was energetic, talkative, and very friendly.</p>
<p>The internal security situation is basically good—about as good as it ever has been in the last ten years. Organized large-scale dissident groups have been broken up into small bands. In some ways, it might be said the situation is now about normal for the area. There usually has been some small scale strife with dissidents, bandits, and those in opposition to the Government.</p>
<p>The biggest single problem confronting President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> at this time in <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>’s opinion is the selection of properly qualified people who will serve him loyally. The background and education of President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> have made this problem especially difficult.</p>
<p>The second biggest problem is the refugee problem—the caring for and relocating of refugees from North Vietnam in such a way that they will be able to care for themselves over the long pull and feel themselves identified with the country.</p>
<p>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> seemed more concerned about the dangers inherent in the situation in Laos than he was about Cambodia.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> felt some apprehension about the lack of contact between President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and the leaders of neighboring countries. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> expressed an interest in such contacts, but did not seem to know exactly how to go about establishing them.</p>

<p>From 1345 until 1510 on 26 July 1956, <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> and his party were briefed at <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Headquarters.

<p>The principal problems confronting the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> are (1) the self-imposed international ceiling of only 342 U.S. military personnel in Vietnam; (2) the recovery, relocation, and out shipment of excess matériel; (3) the reduction of the Vietnamese Forces to more acceptable levels; and (4) the Combined U.S.-French Training Mission (<gloss target="#t_TRIM1">TRIM</gloss>).</p>
<p>The overall Vietnam situation is one of improved stability together with a degree of internal security much improved over two years ago. French Armed Forces have been withdrawn, except for about 5,000. The Vietminh continue building up their strength in the North, and infiltrating their agents into the South. Some civil war with dissident sects continues, but is no longer regarded a serious threat. The sects are now considerably less powerful.</p>
<p>A new force basis for the Vietnamese Armed Forces totalling 170,000 has been proposed in lieu of the present level of 150,000.<note n="3" xml:id="d343fn3">This Vietnamese proposal, originating no later than the spring of 1956, had been strongly supported by <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName>. Documentation on this question is in Center of Military History, <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName> Papers, Memos for Record 1956 (4), <gloss target="#t_TWXS1">TWX</gloss>s 1955–1956 (7) and Official Correspondence 1956 (8).</note> One reason for the proposed increase is to make possible expansion of the Vietnamese Navy and Air Force. It was <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>’s view that it probably would be all right for the Navy and Air Force to have more forces, but any such increases should come by means of adjustments made within the present force level of 150,000.</p>
<p>The French no longer are training the Army, but are still very influential in training the Vietnamese Navy and Air Force. In these two fields, French influence is considerably stronger than that of the United States. French authorities do not cooperate with U.S. officials, and are still reluctant to discuss or let us see <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> equipment they have cached away. The inadequacy of French cooperation is one reason why the Vietnamese supply system cannot be made a great deal more effective.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_735" n="735" facs="0765"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">LGen. Williams</persName> confirmed that no Vietnamese students were in training in the Philippines. He understood the Philippines had run into real estate trouble, and that the costs per student would be too high to warrant sending them to that country. There were seventy-four now ready to go, but in the absence of facilities and in view of the costs, they were not going to be sent. His instructions from Washington were not to send any students to the Philippines.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said there was something funny about this, and that he intended to follow up on it when he returned home. The <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral</persName> outlined his discussions of this matter during his recent visit in the Philippines, and he made the observation that it could not cost any more to send a Vietnamese student to the Philippines for training than it does to send him to the United States. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> suggested that <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">LGen. Williams</persName> establish direct contact with MGen. Harper<note n="4" xml:id="d343fn4">Joseph H. Harper, USA, Chief Adviser of the Joint U.S. Military Advisory Group in the Philippines.</note> and try to push the development of a major training effort for South East Asia into the Philippine Islands. President Magsaysay had been receptive to this concept. In addition, it would be advantageous to help bring these people closer together.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> asked about those Communist guerrilla activities in South Vietnam which had been made possible by introduction and support from the sea. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> wanted to know why the Vietnamese could not stop hostile small boats. The Chief of the Naval Section said the Vietnamese now have two PCs, and in a few months they will have five. Their capabilities are improving, and it should not be too long before the Vietnamese could stop such traffic along the coast. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> felt that with air-search to locate Communist craft, the craft could then be intercepted by a patrol boat and all such movement off the coast of South Vietnam would soon be stopped altogether.</p>
<p>As a final comment, <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> cautioned the senior officers of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> to remember that our requirements are really met when Vietnam is able to take care of its own internal security.</p>

<p rend="sectiontitleital">1. French Military Effort in Viet Nam</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> opened the meeting by referring to the problem caused in Viet Nam by lack of French cooperation. He declared that in his opinion the French training missions there are hurting our cause more than they are helping it. They will not advise <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> regarding activities they are actually carrying on, and neither <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> nor his officers are allowed to visit French controlled training areas. He said he is convinced that the United States must ready itself to take over all training in Viet Nam. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> expressed full concurrence with <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>’s views on the lack of French cooperation in Viet Nam but raised the question whether we should break all ties with them there, having in mind that neither we nor the Vietnamese had signed the 1954 Armistice Agreement, and the French have certain responsibilities in Indo-China under that Agreement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> pointed out that it is the Department’s hope that the French will eventually decide by themselves to withdraw entirely and that the result we all want can thereby be accomplished without creating a situation under which the United States would be in a position to be blamed for forcing the French out.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> asserted that the arrangement proposed by President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> for a defense committee is a good one,<note n="2" xml:id="d344fn2">On August 11, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> discussed with the French a plan for creation of a Committee for Instruction of the Vietnamese Armed Forces. The committee would have as its president <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Chief <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName>, and would have three other representatives—one from <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, one from the French Military Mission, and one from the Armed Forces of Vietnam. The committee would be responsible for the overall direction of the training of Vietnamese armed forces. (Telegram 536 from Saigon, August 13; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> Central Files, 651.51G/8–1356)</note> and the French should not be blocking it.<note n="3" xml:id="d344fn3">An example of the French dissatisfaction with this proposed committee (which the French believed was American-inspired) is in telegram 788 from Paris, August 14. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 651.51G/8–1456)</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> inquired regarding the acceptability of a Vietnamese chairman for the committee, instead of <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> as originally suggested. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> replied that a Vietnamese chairman would be all right with him. He <pb xml:id="pg_737" n="737" facs="0767"/>returned then to his earlier complaint that the French are not cooperating and emphasized that we “should tell them the facts of life”. He went on to declare that the French are not sending any good people to Viet Nam any more and stressed that <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName>’ position has been made quite embarrassing. He complained that our relations with the French are on an all-give and no-take basis and that most of our relations in Viet Nam seem to consist of providing the French with information they want. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> suggested that perhaps the French have about reached the state of mind in which they would be willing to leave Viet Nam entirely in so far as military activities are concerned. He expressed the opinion that it is perhaps a good time to review the situation both in Viet Nam and elsewhere with a view to having a further talk between State and Defense as regards our next moves.</p>

<p>938. 1. When <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Admiral Stump</persName> called on President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> 14th latter said there were several projects he wished particularly to call to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>’s attention and concerning which <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> could fully inform him of President’s views. These were 1) strategic and economic importance of construction lateral roads into PMS, 2) need <pb xml:id="pg_738" n="738" facs="0768"/>to augment <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> force level from 150,000 to 170,000, and 3) logistical shortcomings of <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> armed forces which had been spelled out in <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> general staff paper passed to <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d346fn2">Not found.</note> In urging ambitional [<hi rend="italic">additional</hi>] support for <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> military establishment <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> developed at some length thesis that in present state of country problems of internal security, resettlement of refugees, development and settlement of abandoned lands, and effectiveness of military establishment were all inseparably connected.</p>
<p>2. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> described his current anti-Vietminh operations being carried out by military and other forces which he admitted were more of psychological and police character than truly military. They were proceeding satisfactorily but would require some months for completion. Despite progress achieved, sight must not be lost of fact that internal Vietminh capability was still significant and much remained to be done.</p>
<p>3. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> announced that agreement with French on Saigon arsenal had been signed 13th. This had entailed tedious negotiation and he had finally agreed to pay 319 million francs for certain French equipment. He had, however, insisted French accord him utmost liberality re terms of payment which remained undefined. He said Vietnam would need technical assistance in operation of arsenal, which he hoped could become self-supporting and capable of meeting <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> construction requirements for junks and other small craft. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said he expected issue of French military missions to be satisfactorily resolved in a matter of days. Resolution of Seno Base arrangements would have to await return of Souvanna Phouma.<note n="3" xml:id="d346fn3">According to telegram 863 from Saigon, September 11 (which described the results of the September 8–9 official visit of Souvanna Phouma to Saigon), Laos had agreed in principle to retain the Seno base and airfield because of the American request that it be kept for strategic reasons. Language on the Vietnamese-Lao base agreement was not yet agreed upon. (Department of State, Central Files, 033.51J51G/9–1156)</note></p>
<p>4. With respect to Laos <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> expressed grave concern at Souvanna’s policy of neutrality. Although conceding Souvanna’s personal anti-Communism he felt Laotian Prime Minister underestimated and probably did not understand difficulties and dangers inherent in assimilation of Pathet Lao international community. He remarked that in contrast to Cambodians, Lao were nice people who did not seek to make trouble. He hoped new <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> Legation in Vientiane could be helpful to Lao in problem of dealing with Vietminh and thought there might be other ways <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could be of assistance as in economic field. He was sympathetic to Souvanna’s desire that Tourane become an established outlet for Lao trade. This could be useful to both countries. It would also be logical and shortest route to supply <pb xml:id="pg_739" n="739" facs="0769"/>Seno Base. He again reiterated his desire to obtain some written commitment from Souvanna that base would be available for “defense of free world” (he is quite stubborn on this point, which I will, raise with him again when I next see him).</p>
<p>5. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> stressed his belief that basis of present Lao attitude and policy of neutrality was fear—fear of Vietminh and Chinese, but also a measure of uncertainty regarding Thais. What troubled Souvanna most he felt was thought that, should Laos be invaded it would be matter of two or three weeks before effective foreign aid would arrive on scene. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> reiterated several times conviction that most important thing U.S. could do at this juncture to help situation in Laos was to give RLG assurances of prompt support in event of aggression.</p>

</list>
<p><persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName> called on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> following his return from a 3 weeks tour of Viet-Nam, August 17–September 7, 1956, undertaken at the personal invitation of President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. While in VietNam <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName> represented the American Friends of VietNam. He was the guest of President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> during his entire stay in the country and accompanied the President on several tours in the country and visits to projects and sites.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName>, who had obviously been highly pleased at the reception given him in Viet-Nam, informed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> that in his view Free Viet-Nam was now entirely pacified and secure. The problem of the sects had been completely eliminated and the Viet-Minh’s strength in Free Viet-Nam was rapidly decreasing. <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General <pb xml:id="pg_740" n="740" facs="0770"/>O’Daniel</persName> had found district and local government officials throughout the country to be firm and alert. His overall impression was that “the ship of state was in running order; the only question was that of its direction.”</p>
<p>Among outstanding new projects <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName> had noted during his visit were (1) the extraordinarily successful Cai San refugee relocation project in the South, (2) the new agricultural college at Blau in the Plateaux area, (3) a vast new irrigation project in the Tourane area of Central Viet-Nam. During his travels, <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName> had inquired from strategically-located American missionaries throughout the country as to possible undercurrents among the population. Their response had been uniformly that there were none, and that President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s government was growing increasingly popular.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName> had had a three-hour session with the Vietnamese Cabinet at their request, on September 3, 1956. The meeting made it clear to him that the Vietnamese wanted U.S. technical aid in as large amount as they could possibly absorb. However, the Vietnamese Government wanted itself to select and hire American experts and wished to place them on the Vietnamese payroll. In other words, they wanted U.S. aid gradually to become a Vietnamese rather than an American project. It was also quite clear that the Vietnamese wanted U.S. private capital investment. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had provided <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName> with two papers on this subject which the <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General</persName> had discussed with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> in Saigon and which he passed on to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d347fn2">These papers were not attached to the source text. The text of one is attached to a memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_WFG1">Wisner</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>. Both papers are summarized extensively in a memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>, October 1. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.5–MSP/10–156)</note></p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName> he was delighted that President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was interested in the possibility of private U.S. capital going into his country. This was an excellent way to ensure development of the country in rapid and effective fashion, and he favored it strongly.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName> said that he wished to sound a note of warning if we were unreasonably slow in our aid programs to Viet-Nam, which was what the Vietnamese were complaining about. For example, we had been unreasonably slow in delivering road-building equipment. If we could not speed-up our procedures, we might well lose the gains that we had made so rapidly in the last year.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> agreed that we had a very big stake in Viet-Nam and that we must at all times keep in mind that what we did or did not achieve in Viet-Nam would far transcend in importance the <pb xml:id="pg_741" n="741" facs="0771"/>country of Viet-Nam itself, but would have a profound effect throughout the whole Far East. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> thought that one of our biggest problems wherever U.S. aid was required was the recruitment of qualified personnel. It was understandably extremely difficult to secure the kind of top-level experts that we really wanted in those countries, and yet the success or failure of the aid programs depended in large part on the people we selected to send out.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName> then told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> that he had been informed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Nguyen Huu Chau</persName>, Vietnamese Secretary of State to the Presidency and a close collaborator of President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, who had recently visited New Delhi, that <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> had told <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName> that the Vietnamese should “stick to the West for aid.” <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> had also indicated that the Indians were sending their technicians to West Germany rather than East Germany. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> had further dropped remarks to <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName> implying that he did not trust Prince <persName corresp="#p_SN1">Sihanouk</persName> of Cambodia.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName> next remarked that the Vietnamese felt their request to us for a raise in their force level from 150,000 to 170,000 men was justified on grounds of their great lack of adequate logistical support services in their armed forces. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> stated that we had a very serious Congressional problem to contend with in this respect. In view of the present trend of thinking in the Pentagon with regard to the effect of new technology and weapons on warfare and strategy, there was rapidly decreasing sentiment in Congress for large foreign aid programs. It was becoming increasingly more difficult to secure the needed appropriations. While Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> agreed that Viet-Nam was essential to the free world’s position in Southeast Asia, he wished to stress the realities of the situation with which we had to deal here, and one of these realities was that Congress was in no mood to raise aid, rather to cut it. Moreover, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> pointed out that aid was not simply given, but that aid given must be maintained, as for example the question of providing the necessary maintenance aid to the Koreans for the planes given them under the <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> program.</p>
<p>In concluding the interview, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> thanked <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName> for his highly interesting and encouraging account of the situation in Viet-Nam. We would remain fully aware of the needs of Viet-Nam and of its importance to the free world.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Possible Western Participation In Vietnamese Industry</item>
</list>
<p>1. Attached, for your perusal, is a special memorandum from President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName>, President of the “American Friends of Vietnam”, who has just returned from a month’s visit to Vietnam as the guest of President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. The sidelining is <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName>’s and it highlights those portions of the paper that pertain to the President’s desire to invite private Western investment capital to assist in the development of Vietnamese industry, agriculture, etc. These same passages indicate certain legal and administrative concessions he is prepared to make to induce such participation by “venture” capital.</p>
<p>2. At the very least, it seems to me, we should bring this broad and non-discriminatory invitation to the attention of the French, British, Italian, West German and Japanese embassies here for transmission to their governments. Prior to such action, however, <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName> (who received the memorandum in strict confidence from President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>) requests that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> in Vietnam be given an opportunity to express his own views on the paper—which <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName> informally showed the Ambassador without President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s knowledge—and to ascertain President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s own views, since the latter has not as yet made any official announcement on the subject of foreign “venture” capital.</p>
<p>3. It is my belief that the action proposed above would benefit the United States in the following ways:</p>
<list>
<item>a. Although not personally too sanguine about the willingness of foreign and U.S. “venture” capital to invest in a new and recently disturbed area like Vietnam, possibility remains that there may be some favorable response to President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s invitation. Any such action by private capital may permit the U.S. Government to reduce to some extent the very heavy financial commitments for aid to Vietnam, which otherwise we apparently are going to have to carry for the forseeable future.</item>
<item>b. By our being “forthcoming” in this matter with certain foreign embassies, as suggested above, and particularly if some foreign private capital does venture into Vietnam, we can hope, thereby, to undercut the very popular and successful thesis and propaganda theme that U.S. Government assistance to under-developed countries is merely a cover for Yankee traders to come in and take over these <pb xml:id="pg_743" n="743" facs="0773"/>countries, to the great detriment of the countries as well as to the established commercial interests of their erstwhile colonial masters. As you know, this line has been exploited and accepted by non-Communists as well as Communists—witness the French who have levelled the charge against U.S. efforts in Vietnam and elsewhere. In fact, in nearly every European country with colonial possessions, there are perfectly sober citizens who honestly believe and secretly fear that the U.S. is trying to accomplish just such a take-over of their interests abroad.</item>

<p><hi rend="strong">Special Memorandum From the President of the Republic of Vietnam (<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>) to Retired <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General John W. O’Daniel</persName></hi></p>
<p>When last year, on the occasion of the inauguration of the Dong-Cam Dam, I presented to you the essential economic objectives of my Government, their realization seemed far away and subject to numerous difficulties.</p>
<p>Since then, we have survived victoriously our heavy trials. In the process we have achieved and strengthened our political stability, internal security, and national independence. We have taken active steps to create the political framework for a democratic Government. We are a Republic now. Our popularly-elected National Assembly is another step in that direction. The Constitution which is to govern our way of life will soon see the light of day. We are gradually finding the proper political means for assuring all citizens the right of free development and maximum initiative, responsibility, and spiritual life.</p>
<p>In retrospect, we have come a long way, but we have a much longer and harder way to go. We are confronted with the major problem of how to achieve a measure of industrial development in order to give meaning to the political structure we are in the process of erecting. We can survive as a nation only with a measure of industrial development commensurate with our resources and reasonable requirements. We look to the United States and to the Free World for assistance in this field. But whatever the degree of assistance, we must harness it to our own “will to develop,” and we must mobilize our own means to the same end.</p>
<p>The increase in the national output, the technical equipment of the country, the reduction in the costs of production, and the resulting increase in everyone’s purchasing power, such are, as you know, our principal tasks. Such are indeed the tasks which all the democratic <pb xml:id="pg_744" n="744" facs="0774"/>nations are concerned with. Each of them understands that these ends will not be achieved by its own means alone; there is the full realization that international cooperation in this field is the logical and beneficent consequence of the solidarity of ideas and of the economic interdependence of this vast community called the Free World.</p>
<p>If VietNam, which has given proof of its determination and courage, can rightly count on this solidarity we nonetheless should, in return, take the necessary measures welcoming and protecting the legitimate interests of those willing to invest in our future.</p>
<p>We need investments to maintain and develop the economic potential of our country which, after a long period of destruction and disorder, has just recovered its balance. These investments must be encouraged and guided by the Government and appropriate legislation must be enacted.<note n="2" xml:id="d348fn2">This paragraph was sidelighted by <persName corresp="#p_OD1">O’Daniel</persName>.</note></p>
<p>I call upon all capital holders, be they Vietnamese or of foreign origin, who are really interested in this country, and I urge them to take the risk of investing their capital in order to develop the productive potential of this country.<note n="3" xml:id="d348fn3">This sentence was sidelighted and underlined by <persName corresp="#p_OD1">O’Daniel</persName>.</note> The Government is determined to encourage all investors on the condition that their aim is not merely to exploit the people of VietNam. The measures the Government is ready to adopt will be designed with an eye to stimulate and enlarge investment activities, and to make investments attractive.</p>
<p>I am opposed to nationalization and to any form of economic discrimination. Therefore, I need only refer to the statements I made on this subject last year.</p>
<p>In order to give effective protection to commercial and industrial property rights, the Government of VietNam will adhere to international reciprocal agreements and arrangements for the protection of such rights. The Government of VietNam is ready to negotiate with any country of the Free World reciprocal agreements giving to the citizens of the contracting country the same rights enjoyed by the citizens of VietNam.<note n="4" xml:id="d348fn4">This paragraph was sidelighted and the last sentence was underlined by <persName corresp="#p_OD1">O’Daniel</persName>. In the margin he wrote “Investments”, as he did in the margin of the next paragraph.</note></p>
<p>To facilitate the formation of investment companies, provisions will be made for the abolition of the incorporation fees, the abolition of the fees for the extension of the life of a company, for the changes in the company name and dissolution of companies, and, finally, exemption of fees in cases of company mergers or a company’s increase of capital.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_745" n="745" facs="0775"/>
<p>In order that the invested capital make its maximum contribution to the country’s productivity, the Government will grant income tax reductions or exemptions to industrial, agricultural, and mining enterprises. Favorable conditions will be created for the importation of capital goods or raw materials which are part of the investment effort. Terms governing the importation of goods for processing and their eventual export will be made flexible.<note n="5" xml:id="d348fn5">The first two sentences were sidelighted and underlined by <persName corresp="#p_OD1">O’Daniel</persName> and he wrote “Investments” in the margin.</note> The formalities related to the granting of licenses will be eased in order to speed up the flow of imports. Custom duties will be reduced on the capital goods financed through the foreign exchange reserves of VietNam. They will be abolished if the importation of such goods is financed by the investor. Foreign capital will benefit from certain allocations and conditions for transferring profits, amortization costs, or repatriation of the investment.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in order to avoid the development of parasitic activities or of activities not benefiting the country, the Government will ask those who participate in the economic development and stand to benefit from it to submit their projects to the Planning Directorate which is charged with coordinating all developmental activities. Measures will be taken so that the initiative of the investors is not smothered by administrative procedures which are more concerned with formalities than with efficiency.</p>
<p>Such measures must further the effort already made by the Secretary of State for National Economy to reorganize the distribution system and to reduce the role played by the middlemen. These measures must also help us to protect our currency. Indeed it is not enough to fight against the black market; we must also check the rise in prices which has developed during the past few months. The resulting social claims bringing about a rise in wages again influence the prices, thus starting a race, the effects of which all modern nations dread.</p>
<p>To protect the effectiveness of the purchasing power of the workers, I give preference to a policy of steady wages in an economy where prices are stable rather than a competition between prices and wages of which the workers are invariably the first victims. Our worker organizations must understand this and must help us to lead the country toward a coherent and steady effort of production, while not mistaking social action for social agitation.</p>

<dateline><hi rend="italic"><placeName>Washington</placeName>, <date when="1956-10-10">October 10, 1956</date></hi>.</dateline>
<p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_WFG1">Frank</persName>: Referring to your memorandum of September 27,<note n="2" xml:id="d349fn2"><hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note> on Western participation in Vietnamese industry, I certainly agree that everything possible should be done to encourage foreign private capital investment in Viet-Nam, both as a means of reducing our very heavy financial commitment for aid, and as a means of insuring the development of that country in the most rapid and effective fashion. I am very pleased to see that President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> desires United States private capital investment in Viet-Nam and believe that he should be encouraged to take effective steps leading to such investments becoming an actuality.</p>
<p>Approximately two months ago we learned that the Vietnamese were considering the enactment of a foreign investment law and feared that, in view of the ultra-nationalistic tendencies among certain Vietnamese officials, such a law if enacted at the present time might contain restrictive features which would discourage rather than encourage foreign investment. In our telegram 525 to the Embassy in Saigon<note n="3" xml:id="d349fn3">Dated August 20, not printed. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.34/8–856)</note> we suggested that it would be wiser at the present time for the Vietnamese to proceed on an ad hoc basis contracting with each potential investor as a separate case, thereby gaining experience upon which to base an investment law in the future. However, as indicated in the reply of Embassy Saigon contained in its telegram 716<note n="4" xml:id="d349fn4">Dated August 29, not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.34/8–2956)</note> apparently some Vietnamese believe that it is necessary to press for a liberal investment law at this time in order to head off an ultra-nationalistic approach.</p>
<p>The basic problem at the present time seems to be creation of a climate highly favorable to foreign investment in Viet-Nam of which an investment law would be only one element. In our communications with Saigon, cited above, we pointed out that signing of an <gloss target="#t_FCN1">FCN</gloss> treaty between Viet-Nam and the United States would be helpful in this regard and in response to our approach negotiations are now underway with the Vietnamese on such a treaty. A statement by the President of Viet-Nam such as that attached to your memorandum—copies of this proposed statement were also left with me by <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName> and forwarded by our Embassy in Saigon under <pb xml:id="pg_747" n="747" facs="0777"/>cover of Despatch 93 of September 15, 1956<note n="5" xml:id="d349fn5">Not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.34/9–1556)</note>—would also be helpful in creating the necessary favorable climate.</p>
<p>I believe that President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should be encouraged to make a statement along these lines. I think that in advance of such a statement we should not give copies of any proposed statement to the French, British, Italian, West German, and Japanese Embassies here in Washington as suggested in your memorandum. I believe that any statement by the Vietnamese President along these lines should initially be called to the attention of these Governments by the Vietnamese themselves since our doing so would only give further ammunition to those who charge that Viet-Nam is under the domination of the United States and that the United States has an inordinate amount of control over Viet-Nam. Therefore, I believe that after President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has made his public statement, he should be encouraged to bring this statement to the attention of the Governments of all non-Communist countries whose nationals might be interested in investment in Viet-Nam.</p>
<p>A copy of your memorandum and of this reply are being sent to the Embassy in Saigon for its information and appropriate action.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>

<dateline><hi rend="italic"><placeName>Washington</placeName>, <date when="1956-10-12">October 12, 1956</date></hi>.</dateline>
<p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">John</persName>: In the fall of 1955, an inter-agency costing mission (the <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Lawton</persName> Team) was sent to Saigon to develop recommendations for reducing the Vietnamese defense budget to the extent possible within national security objectives.<note n="2" xml:id="d350fn2">See <ref target="#d288">Document 288</ref>.</note> From the efforts of this mission and the subsequent work of the Country Team, the piastre budget for <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1956 was reduced from $255 million equivalent (estimated <pb xml:id="pg_748" n="748" facs="0778"/>by the Country Team in August 1955) to $203 million, and finally to $198.6 million maximum.</p>
<p>Although the efforts of the last year constitute excellent progress toward solution of a large and complicated problem, the possibilities of additional improvement through further intensive work merit consideration at this time. With this in mind, and at the suggestion of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FGDDA1">FitzGerald</persName>, members of my staff and I gave this subject special consideration during our recent visit to Saigon.</p>
<p>Salaries and allowances, which constitute 60 per cent of the Vietnamese defense budget, present the largest potential for further analysis. The salary and allowances cost of the Vietnamese soldier averages 2 1/2 times that of each member of the Thai armed forces. For Viet-Nam, the U.S. pays 90 per cent of the costs; in Thailand the Thai national government foots the bill. Of course, it would be impossible to apply the pay structure of one country directly to the economy of another country. Nevertheless, if a formula could be devised to apply in Viet-Nam a military pay system comparable to the one in Thailand, savings to the United States of up to $65 million a year in defense support funds might be realized—savings which could be applied to a net reduction in defense support allotments to Viet-Nam or applied to the procurement of producer goods.</p>
<p>In as much as the problem in Laos and Cambodia is similar to Viet-Nam, savings totaling as much as $20 million a year might be realized in these countries.</p>
<p>As an approach to the solution of the national defense budgetary problems of these three countries, the following courses of action are suggested for your consideration:</p>
<list>
<item>1. The formation of a small team of specialists on military personnel costs to study this problem in Viet-Nam and on their return to Washington recommend appropriate action. Inasmuch as over two-thirds of the total military personnel expenditures for the three countries is required in Viet-Nam, it would appear preferable to complete the project for this country first. If successful in Viet-Nam, similar projects for Laos and Cambodia could then be undertaken.</item>
<item>2. The development of a longer range technical assistance program to assist the Vietnamese government—especially the military budget staff—in improving the system of budgetary administration.</item>
</list>
<p>Within the past month, members of the Washington staff of the International Cooperation Administration have worked on these problems with representatives of the Department of Defense, both in Saigon and in Washington. Representatives of the Office of Philippine and Southeast Asian Affairs, State Department, have also participated in the recent Washington discussions. It is my understanding that they are in general agreement that an approach along these lines is desirable. If you and Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> concur in <pb xml:id="pg_749" n="749" facs="0779"/>these views, it would seem useful for our staffs to work further to formulate detailed recommendations on (a) the functions and membership of a military personnel costs team; and (b) the objectives and functions of a technical assistance activity on budgeting in VietNam.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as the new Vietnamese fiscal year is less than three months away, it is suggested that priority might well be given to the military personnel costs problem.</p>
<p>An identical letter is being sent to Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d350fn3">Not printed. (Washington National Records Center, <gloss target="#t_OASDISA1">OASD/ISA</gloss> Files: <gloss target="#t_FRC1">FRC</gloss> 60 A 1339, 121 Vietnam) Both <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> responded favorably to the suggestions and recommendations in this letter and expressed willingness for their agencies to participate in attacking the problem of the high cost of military assistance to Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> also recommended that the views of the country team should be invited.

<p>1674. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> summoned me evening November 16 to discuss U Nu visit.<note n="2" xml:id="d352fn2">U Nu, former Prime Minister of Burma and chairman of the dominant political party in Burma, the Anti-Fascist People’s Freedom League, visited Saigon in mid-November.</note> Apparent from outset President both pleased at way visit went off and impressed with personality of guest whom he repeatedly described as simple, kind and deeply religious with high moral sense of justice. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> recounted details of visit outlined Embassy telegram 1643<note n="3" xml:id="d352fn3">Not printed. (Department of State, Central Files, 033.90B51G/11–1456)</note> and asserted he had from outset decided it would be preferable to avoid raising controversial questions with Nu and simply to show him country and people in most informal fashion possible. This he had done and he felt sure it had been correct tactic.</p>
<p>Nu had asked about unification of Vietnam and was told this was an internal question for which time would be ripe when South had built up its economic and military strength sufficiently to meet North on equal terms. At such juncture <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said he would be happy to meet <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> face to face. Concerning relations with Soviet Russia <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had said that Vietnam was too small and delicate a garden to have such a massive elephant rooting around with its trunk amid the straw huts and pagodas. It was true American elephant was present but it was friendly creature and brought Vietnamese presents of bananas. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was convinced that U Nu’s impromptu conversations with Vietnamese and Thai refugees had brought home to him some of plain truths of Communist barbarity. He had given Nu comprehensive briefing history <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> and Viet Minh movement. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> thought their drive together along miles of unpatrolled jungle roads had impressed him with measure of internal security already attained here. Although Nu had not raised the subject Myint Thein<note n="4" xml:id="d352fn4">Myint Thein, former Burmese Ambassador to China, was a Justice of the Burmese Supreme Court.</note> had said that Burmese were much more concerned with indirect Communist aggression and subversion than with the possibility of overt aggression. (If one is to believe <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s account there was less topical political content in his conversations with Nu than in latter’s Saigon press conference.)</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said his guest had invited him to visit Burma, suggested a visit by Vietnamese military officers and expressed himself in favor <pb xml:id="pg_751" n="751" facs="0781"/>of establishment of relations between the two countries but that nothing specific had been decided on any of these points. (British Embassy on contrary was told by senior official of Burmese delegation that agreement had been reached to exchange Consuls General.)</p>
<p>It is general consensus here that visit was indeed highly successful. It marks, I believe, stage in this government’s process of growing up and revealed new level of sophistication on part of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> himself.</p>

<p>1. Country Team should reiterate to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> US Government’s deep interest sound and successful land reform program Vietnam. If carried out effectively could greatly enhance popular support <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> regime eliminating major grievance which Communists have attempted exploit. Under proper administration, it should also result in increased internal revenues, enabling reduction Vietnam’s dependence on foreign aid.</p>
<p>2. Agree with importance attached to development of adequate administrative plan. Emphasize to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> again that in absence careful planning administrative details indicated ref (B), entire scheme may fail leading to great disillusionment and bitterness among peasants and severe loss of prestige his regime. Believe weaknesses draft ordinance can be overcome by careful planning and administration.</p>
<p>3. US therefore prepared offer certain forms assistance planning and execution this program. Depending on availability and Vietnamese preference, prepared (a) recruit special team experienced US, Formosan or Japanese technicians assist Government in planning program, developing procedures, and training Vietnamese personnel required to operate program, (b) arrange intensive training and observation Vietnam officials in Taiwan, and (c) approve counterpart financing for all or substantial part of additional administrative costs incurred this program (estimated at $3–5 million).</p>
<p>4. We still question whether cash downpayment is necessary feature land transfers. But if such payment unavoidable, we feel if possible it should be borne by Vietnamese Government through reprogramming own budget or deficit financing. This would permit <pb xml:id="pg_754" n="754" facs="0784"/><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> claim full credit for conceiving and financing popular program. It might also result in more reasonable and prudent assessment land values. Unlikely deficit financing this operation seriously inflationary because land owners represent relatively small group presumably not interested spending funds consumption purposes and might prefer suitable alternative investment opportunities. This source of funds might be tapped through bond issues, proceeds to be devoted to reconstruction projects. Return on these projects either directly or through general increase in production would provide revenue for service on bonds.</p>
<p>5. In this connection you may wish give careful thought desirability and feasibility of scheme whereby landlords could acquire ownership on approved industrial plants or other productive enterprises through purchase of shares therein with funds obtained from commercial or government investment bank on security bonds received in land transfer. Part of capital for government bank might be provided also through counterpart loan. This might be beneficial to economy and contribute US objective encouraging private investment.</p>
<p>6. Suggest you discuss above with Vietnamese and advise.</p>
<p>7. While general statements have been made by US officials of friendly interest in land reform program, <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName> received no assurance from US officials here of US financial support for land reform program.

<p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_HWC1">Wes</persName>: We have had quite a go-round on the subject of land reform. I do not know what response you wanted in answer to your telegrams 472 and 1372<note n="2" xml:id="d355fn2">Neither printed, but see <ref target="#d354fn2">footnotes 2</ref> and <ref target="#d354fn3">3, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi></ref>.</note> but felt pretty sure that <gloss target="#t_Icato1">Icato</gloss> 716 was not <pb xml:id="pg_755" n="755" facs="0785"/>the answer needed or wanted. However, after four weeks of effort all I could do was get the two words “if possible” added in the second sentence of paragraph four of <gloss target="#t_Icato1">Icato</gloss> 716.</p>
<p>My first inclination on receipt of your 1372 was to reply that we would get off our equivocal position as soon as you got off yours and to ask you for a specific recommendation whether the United States should help finance the down payment to the landlords if an adequate plan for administering the land reform program could be worked out. However, further study of the file on land reform convinced me that you in fact were asking us if the United States Government would be prepared to help finance such down payment and that we should give you a straightforward answer. Therefore, on October 25, I drafted the attached four paragraph telegram<note n="3" xml:id="d355fn3">The draft cable was not attached to the source text and has not been found in Department of State files.</note> to which no one in State would agree except <gloss>SEA</gloss>.</p>
<p>After prolonged discussions within State, including two or three redrafts of the memo dated November 16<note n="4" xml:id="d355fn4">Not attached and not found in Department of State files. Attached was a copy of an October 26 memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>, printed as an enclosure to this letter. Apparently it was a draft of the November 16 memorandum.</note> (also attached) to satisfy several stylistic experts, we finally got the problem presented to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>. He, however, refused to move in the direction we requested because there was no recommendation from the field on the basic issue of whether or not we could give assistance for the down payment if an adequate plan for administration was worked out. He felt that <gloss target="#t_Icato1">Icato</gloss> 716 was not as much a closing of the door as I thought it was. In both cases, events have proven that he was correct.</p>
<p>As this is being written another cable of enquiry has gone through channels asking a number of unanswerable questions.<note n="5" xml:id="d355fn5">Sent as joint State/<gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> telegram 1527 to Saigon, December 3, in which State and <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> asked the Embassy and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> to estimate (a) the extent to which the Government of Vietnam could provide a down payment for the land transfer out of its own budget and out of deficit financing in subsequent years, (b) whether the Embassy and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> were satisfied that the program would be a success, (c) whether U.S. financial support was essential, (d) what would be the consequences of failure of the United States to support the program, (e) the extent to which U.S. financial suport would increase the price of land to be acquired, and (f) whether the Embassy and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> recommended support of the program. Finally the Department and <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> asked a number of detailed questions on the number of hectares included in the program, the price of land, and the breakdown of costs of the program by fiscal years. (Department of State, Central Files, 851G.20/10–2456)</note> However, it also asks for your recommendation on the problem of down payment. I believe that with this we will begin to know what <pb xml:id="pg_756" n="756" facs="0786"/>each other thinks of this particular program and the attachments certainly should give you an idea that I am very much in favor of it.</p>

<item>US Support for Land Redistribution Program in Viet-Nam.</item>
</list>
<p>There is attached a draft telegram<note n="8" xml:id="d355fn8">Not printed, but see <ref target="#d355fn3">footnote 3</ref> above.</note> prepared in <gloss>SEA</gloss> giving Saigon guidance on US support for this program. While general statements have been made by US officials of friendly interest in this program, the US Government has not specifically instructed the Embassy on support. I strongly recommend that we do so now.</p>
<p>For two years the Department’s policy telegrams and papers on Viet-Nam have stressed the importance of an effective program of land reform in Viet-Nam to build up strength in the South and to serve as one of the major counters to the Viet Minh. The issue posed in this telegram and its references is whether or not the US should finance actual transfers of land from a land owner to farmers receiving specified allotments under the new ordinance which President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> intends to announce today, October 26. There will be opposition in E and probably <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> to such a decision for it will set a precedent for other countries. However, the stark fact is that unless the US Government is willing to find some mechanism to help finance this crucial program in Viet-Nam, it may not be undertaken. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> and the Vietnamese Government would be able to say that this key program was stopped by lack of concrete support from the US.</p>
<p>I cannot stress too strongly the political, psychological, social, and economic reasons for our going ahead with this program in Viet-Nam, where the free way of life is pitted against the Communist as in no other country in Southeast Asia today. The long-term peaceful struggle for influence and control in Viet-Nam and in Southeast Asia <pb xml:id="pg_757" n="757" facs="0787"/>will hinge on whether or not the mass of the farmers can be won over to a democratic constitutional regime and can be counted on not only in the South but in the North to increase their opposition to the Communists. It is a stated <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policy in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5612/1<note n="9" xml:id="d355fn9">See <ref target="#d345">Document 345</ref>.</note> to make South Viet-Nam more attractive for all Vietnamese than the North. The sooner and the better we do this the more assured will be our long-term policy in Southeast Asia. I acknowledge that there are practical risks and difficulties in proceeding with US financial support for land reform anywhere, as well as in Viet-Nam. Nevertheless, I am confident that the US Government can apply the necessary ingenuity and find the resources to develop a prudent and feasible form of such support. I think we should explore long-term soft currency loan, token reimbursement by the Vietnamese, or a modest PL 480<note n="10" xml:id="d355fn10">The reference is to the Agricultural Development and Assistance Act of 1954, approved July 10, 1954; 68 Stat. 454.</note> program to provide the local currency.</p>
<p>In sum, the political challenge to us and to the Vietnamese Government in this undertaking justifies in my opinion your support for this program. Therefore, I strongly hope that you will endorse this proposal and add your support in persuading other parts of the Department and other agencies to concur and to create the means for carrying it out. Without your endorsement and advocacy of this program, I am afraid that other elements and agencies in Washington will talk it to death.</p>

<item>Diplomatic and Other Exploitations of North Viet-Nam Uprising</item>
</list>
<p>On November 23 the Embassy proposed a five-stage action program for exploitation of the North Viet-Nam uprising.<note n="2" xml:id="d356fn2">See <ref target="#d353">Document 353</ref>.</note> The Department approved the program, which was passed on to the Vietnamese on November 25.</p>
<p>The first three stages have been completed. That is: <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> issued a public declaration recounting the tragic events in North Viet-Nam, denouncing communist brutality and appealing strongly for a new look at the problem of freedom of movement between the two zones; <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> addressed a message to the Secretary General of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss>, asking the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> [to] consider practical measures for the prevention of new massacres, protection of those who had taken part in the uprising and in obtaining freedom of movement; the same day the Vietnamese Government sent a letter to the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>, transmitting a petition from recent escaped refugees from the North reciting incidents and claiming <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> authorities never informed the local populace of their rights to freedom of movement under the Geneva agreements and requesting a review of the whole question of freedom of movement.</p>
<p>We suggested that the Vietnamese undertake to obtain the services of a Thai spokesman at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss>, and we have persuaded the Vietnamese to send their Ambassador to New York, since the degree to which this matter can be exploited will depend on the extent to which the Vietnamese themselves can make a case in New York and with countries with which they have representation.</p>
<p>At an appropriate time we are prepared to make a statement either within or outside the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> supporting <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s letter to the Secretary General and whatever statement is made by a Thai or other spokesman and announcing our willingness to assist in any refugee movement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> is following the situation at New York.</p>
<p>We shall continue to keep this issue alive but believe it essential that we not overplay our hand. The available hard news on the uprising does not begin to compare with the news on the Hungarian situation, for example, and we must keep in mind the risk of sacrificing <pb xml:id="pg_759" n="759" facs="0789"/>credibility to enthusiasm. At any rate, the extreme shrillness and anxiety betrayed by the Viet Minh radio reaction to free world exploitation of the uprising clearly indicates that they’re being hurt.</p>

<p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Ken</persName>: The question of Vietnamese-American relations, raised in your letter of October 29,<note n="2" xml:id="d357fn2"><p>This letter is attached to a copy of the letter from <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> of December 20, <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> Saigon Embassy Files: Lot 62 F 52, 320 International Relations, A–Z, 1956–1958. <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> observed that “several of us in the Department and the other agency have noticed recent indications of increasing difficulties in dealing with the President.” <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> asked for <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName>’s reaction to the following questions:</p>
<p>“(a) The reaction of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> and those close around him to American official and unofficial advice.</p>
<p>“(b) The prospects of such concentration of decision and power over such a wide and seemingly unnecessary range of matters.</p>
<p>“(c) The theory of ‘mandarinism’.”</p></note> has been one to which we have devoted increasing attention in recent months. Although I do not believe that any fundamental change in the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s attitude has occurred, I think there is no question that a gradual trend toward greater assertiveness vis-à-vis Americans has been developing for some time and can be expected to continue. Although American assistance is eagerly sought, American advice, as you well know, has never been accepted with any alacrity, particularly on political issues. The few occasions, moreover, in which our “political” advice has materially affected <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> policies have been essentially limited to international issues. Our influence in shaping internal developments, partly because we have voluntarily refrained from asserting maximum effort, has been extremely circumscribed.</p>
<p>There has been some evidence that President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, as he grows more sure of himself through the success he has achieved, is becoming less receptive to unofficial advice given to him by special advisors and close friends. There is probably little that we could do about this situation, and although it is regrettable, I do not consider it alarming. The major effect of this attitude will, I believe, be felt in our economic aid program. It may eventually be necessary, if serious differences of views develop in this field, to make clear to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that our continued ability to support the Vietnamese Government will <pb xml:id="pg_760" n="760" facs="0790"/>depend on the adoption by the latter of certain basic economic policies which will permit us to justify such aid to the American Congress.</p>
<p>With regard to the problem created by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s concentration of decision and power over such a seemingly wide range of matters, there is again little that can be done beyond recognizing that this unfortunate state of affairs has existed since the beginning of the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> regime and will likely be with us for some time. Continuous efforts are being made by <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> to point out the necessity of proper delegation of responsibilities and some improvement is made from time to time along these lines. With the passage of time and the development of really functioning governmental institutions and procedures it can be hoped that these efforts will increasingly bear fruit, although it must be recognized that the source of the difficulty lies principally in the personality of the President, which is not likely to change radically.</p>
<p>You also asked about the theory of “mandarinism.” This much used and misused word had been made to cover a multitude of sins. Essentially, as I understand it, it is mostly used to describe a form of bureaucratic aristocracy in which decisions of government are largely made by a small group of government officials steeped in the traditions of their office and distrustful of the masses, from which, ironically enough, most of them sprang. In the context of present day realities mandarinism essentially describes an attitude of paternalism approaching benevolent despotism. Certainly one can find elements of the mandarin tradition, in its better sense, in <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s philosophy of government. Yet I think it would be erroneous not to recognize that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is far too intelligent and forward-looking to be the prisoner of his own early training and experience as a member of the mandarinate.</p>

<p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName>: Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName>’s excellent report, “Program Evaluation—Vietnam,” a copy of which you forwarded me on 8 December 1956,<note n="2" xml:id="d358fn2">Not found.</note> is of much interest to me and my staff. In my opinion, the report effectively summarizes the results of the U.S. effort in Vietnam to date and realistically forecasts developments expected in the immediate future.</p>
<p>Of particular interest is the Ambassador’s evaluation of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>’s contribution to the establishment of a stable government in South Vietnam. The last paragraph on page 6 of the report was quoted in a recent <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> message to <gloss target="#t_CNO1">CNO</gloss>. You and all your personnel should feel great satisfaction in the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>’s accomplishments and be assured that I point with pride to the results of our military aid efforts in Vietnam, and to the part you have played in achieving them.</p>
<p>In this connection, General Magruder,<note n="3" xml:id="d358fn3">Lieutenant General Carter B. Magruder, Deputy Chief of Army Staff (Logistics).</note> during his stay here, gave me his observations on his recent trip. He likewise considers that remarkable progress has been made in all aspects of the aid program and particularly in the activities of <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> and I was happy to hear that he also appreciated your efforts in Saigon and the fine relations you have with the Vietnamese. However, he did express some concern over any efforts which might be made to reduce or eliminate <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> on the basis of the progress that has been made or upon completion of the task of segregating and cataloging the excess property now in Vietnam. He feels there is a need for continued effort by this group in training the Vietnamese armed forces in proper logistic procedures and increasing their capability to provide adequate logistic support for their own forces. I know you concur in this idea and I certainly agree this must be done.</p>
<p>During our discussion it occurred to me that if we move out the reparable and usable property promptly but not be in too big a hurry to move the junk and scrap, it might provide visible evidence of a continuing project. With all the checks that are being made on <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss>, any indication that they had cleaned things up and show evidence of completing their task would cause increased pressure from many quarters to remove the group and thereby lose their services <pb xml:id="pg_762" n="762" facs="0792"/>for the other aspects of their task. This may be one instance where neat and orderly outward appearance may prove detrimental.</p>
<p>You might give this thought some consideration in any efforts to lessen pressure for the removal of the <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> personnel. Further, if you have any ideas on methods that might prove beneficial, I would be glad to have them. As the excellent progress being made by this group continues, I am sure we shall hear more about their withdrawal.</p>
<p>Your reports are always most helpful to me and I appreciate you keeping me informed on all the activities in Vietnam.</p>
<p>With warm regards and best wishes for your continued success in the coming year.</p>

No doubt <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> considers such a visit would greatly enhance Vietnamese prestige both as against the northern Communist regime and in Southeast Asia generally.

<p>Viet-Nam is our newest and one of our staunchest friends in Asia.

As I understand front <gloss target="#t_UPR1">U/PR</gloss> that the heavy present schedule of state visits makes it impracticable to invite President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in May, I strongly recommend that we avoid offering him a total rebuff by fixing as firmly as possible a date later in 1957, possibly in November or December.</p>

<p>2633. 1. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> called me in yesterday to outline his thoughts on measures to 1) enhance security especially in plateau and border regions and 2) promote development small industries.</p>
<p>2. On first point, he said he was ordering establishment of “posts” each consisting of 50 to 500 older members of Garde Civile or army in such areas as Kontum, Pleiku, Ban Me Thuot and Plaine des Joncs. Men would be ordered to posts but would be given land to cultivate on retirement and thus become nuclei for permanent settlements. Establishment of posts would encourage other settlers to enter areas and would also facilitate resettlement in event of any future major movement of refugees from north. In this way uninhabited but strategically important parts of Vietnam could be made secure and threat of Communist infiltration or rapid occupation in war would be minimized.</p>
<p>3. With respect to development of small industries, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had been in touch with Acting Director <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and Vice President to explore possibility of manufacturing and processing in Vietnam items which have been imported for armed forces. Heretofore many such items had been coming for example from Japan, whose industrial potential had now been reestablished. It was therefore high time Vietnam take constructive steps in this field. This should certainly be possible when manufacturers have an assured market provided by armed forces.</p>
<p>4. Neither of these ideas is new. However, with respect to establishment of posts <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> indicated great sense of urgency, pointing out housing should be put up before rains begin about mid-April. It seemed likely to me that his interest in this subject had been stimulated by recent attempt on his life,<note n="2" xml:id="d360fn2"><p>As <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was arriving on foot for the inauguration of the Ban Me Thuot Economic Fair on the morning of February 22, an assailant fired a shot at him at close range which missed him but seriously wounded South Vietnam’s Secretary of Agrarian Reform. (Telegram 2590 from Saigon, February 22; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 751G.11/2–2257)</p>

<item>Semi-official Visit of Brother of President of Viet-Nam</item>
</list>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName>, brother and political advisor of President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> of the Republic of Viet-Nam, is making a round the world trip in a semi-official capacity. He is <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s most influential advisor and he wields great power behind the scenes. His wife serves as the President’s official hostess.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> has expressed the desire to have a brief interview with you during his visit. He explains that the Government of Viet-Nam feels that its status vis-à-vis its Asian neighbors would benefit if he could see you before President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> starts a projected tour of Southeast Asia. I believe that granting Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> an interview would serve to enhance Vietnamese prestige both as against the northern communist regime and in Southeast Asia generally.</p>
<p>Viet-Nam is our newest and one of our staunchest friends in Asia and we have great reason to be satisfied with President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s performance and therefore reason to show the highest level attention to his brother and close advisor. If it meets with your approval I would like to instruct our Embassy in Saigon to tell President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that you have learned that his brother is planning a tour which includes a visit to the United States and that you would be pleased to see him while he is here. A brief call scheduled for some time between March 25 and March 30 would be all that would be necessary and appropriate.</p>

<p><persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName> is of course right that the first name is the family name in Vietnamese and the third name the individual’s personal name. He has, however, misled <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Admiral Stump</persName> on other counts. Using the third name preceded by Mr. or the person’s title is standard practice among the Vietnamese themselves and universally used by all foreigners. Although the Vietnamese generally use all 3 names when referring to President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> in official documents, it is frequently abbreviated to President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, almost never to President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> (including publications issued by the press office of the presidency in 1956).</p>
<p>In very rare instances a Vietnamese will rise so far above his compatriots in stature that he becomes known by his first name. <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> is the outstanding and perhaps the only example of this today. It has been obvious for many months that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and his entourage have been anxious to raise the president’s prestige by placing him on a comparable pedestal with <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> and the expression “President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName>” has been used off and on, mostly in adulatory articles in the press, for over a year.</p>
<p>If the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> wishes to make this standard practice it would be relatively easy for us to follow suit.<note n="3" xml:id="d363fn3"><p>According to telegram 3116 from Saigon, April 13, <persName>Anderson</persName> put the question squarely to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> as to his preference for “<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>” or “<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName>”. <persName>Anderson</persName> reported the conversation of April 12 as follows:</p>
<p>“He stated categorically preference for latter which was in accordance with Vietnamese tradition and current practice with respect to <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-Shek</persName> and even <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName>. Characteristically he blamed French for having started and perpetuated <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> appellation.</p>
<p>“Under circumstances I believe we should use president’s full name whenever appropriate but should respect his wishes which are in line with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s recent efforts to have him known as <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName>.</p>
<p>“It will of course be some time before this change will be generally accepted. It will probably be longer, if ever, before brother <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> will be generally referred to as ‘Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Ngo</persName>’ ” . (Department of State, Central Files, 751.11/4–1357)</p>
<p><persName>Anderson</persName>’s suggestion that the Department use <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s full name whenever appropriate became standard practice. (Telegram 2710 to Saigon, April 17; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 751G.11/4–1757)</p></note> However, as long as the overwhelming majority of Vietnamese as well as all other foreign nationals continue to speak of President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> it would appear a little odd if we were the only ones to begin calling him President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName>. As for <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName> himself, it is doubtful that either you or I will see the day when he is known as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> or Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Ngo</persName>.</p>

In conversation with me March 28 lasting more than two hours and in talk March 29 with <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Maxwell Taylor</persName>,<note n="2" xml:id="d365fn2"><persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, was in Saigon March 29–31, where, in addition to talks with Vietnamese leaders, he visited military installations.

<p>2. In talk with me <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> dwelt at length on unfavorable developments Thailand and Cambodia (but strangely failed mention Laos or Indonesia). As for Thailand he felt Pibul had been greatly shaken by recent events<note n="3" xml:id="d365fn3">The reference is to the election in Thailand in which Prime Minister Pibul’s party won a narrow majority amid charges of corruption and election tampering.

In Cambodia Russians and their Chinese <pb xml:id="pg_769" n="769" facs="0799"/>friends were rapidly entrenching themselves in privileged positions and had already done much to win over important Chinese minority.</p>
<p>3.

<p>4. In view of all this ferment <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said he had himself recently “briefed” groups from army and National Assembly on situation. He had told them rely more and more on own efforts and prepare for austerity and difficulties ahead.</p>
<p>5. In talk with <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> refrained from going into details but made point of emphasizing general danger of Communist subversive thrust.<note n="8" xml:id="d365fn8"><persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName> reported on this conversation to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> in telegram <gloss target="#t_MAGCH1">MAGCH</gloss> 5390, April 1 (011059Z) and commented: “During conference between <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> President spoke in generalities only and without too much energy.” (Center of Military History, William Papers, <gloss target="#t_TWXS1">TWX</gloss>s 1957 (14)) A memorandum of this conversation by Colonel Usera is <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> Conversations with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> 31 Dec 56–12 Sept 57.

<p>6.

<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> opened the conversation by saying he was sorry to have missed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> during his visit to Saigon about a year and a half ago when Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> was absent on a special mission in the high plateau region and that he remembered having had the pleasure of meeting Madame <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> at the President’s palace. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said that before his departure from Saigon the President had instructed him to discuss with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> various problems concerning American aid. He said that the Vietnamese hoped to make the most efficacious use of American aid so that they could soon reach the point where they would no longer need it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> replied that he shared this Vietnamese desire. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said the Vietnamese well realized that if they were not careful American aid could become a sort of opium paralyzing the country.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said that Vietnamese Government tried to solve various problems simultaneously rather than individually. In this spirit the Government took a broad view of its problems and tried to link them together when possible. A number of Vietnamese technicians had come here to discuss the details of specific problems with <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>/Washington. With Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName>’s permission Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> would confine himself to a general treatment of questions of aid policy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> to speak freely about whatever problems he had in mind, since <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>’s only aim was to do the best it could for Viet-Nam with the funds available.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said that the Vietnamese Government felt that the question of triangular franc aid and other triangular currency aid should be discussed in advance with it before decisions were made. Mr. Bunting remarked that it was our impression that this matter had been discussed fully with the Vietnamese Government in Saigon. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName> interposed that they had gotten exactly the opposite impression from his government. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> said that since we and <pb xml:id="pg_771" n="771" facs="0801"/>the Vietnamese had such divergent understandings of this matter we would check to see just what discussion had taken place between the United States and the Government of Viet-Nam in Saigon. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said that the Vietnamese Government could assist the United States by putting pressure on the Japanese and on the French in the course of negotiations of triangular currency aid with a view to orienting Japan and France toward our political views. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> said that <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> was not interested in triangular currency aid for its own sake, but was primarily interested in doing what was needed for the well-being of Viet-Nam. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> repeated his earlier observation that the Government of Viet-Nam desired that triangular currency arrangements be discussed with it in advance.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> next raised the question of highway construction, pointing out that whereas the Government of Viet-Nam desired so-called strategic highways, <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> took the position that coastal, commercial highways were more useful. However, the Vietnamese Government took its usual broad view of the problem of highway construction. For example, the Government desired to settle people in the underpopulated plateau region. The so-called strategic roads would serve these areas and would have not only strategic significance but also social and economic significance, since they would be serving the new population in these areas. If the Vietnamese Government has had some success during the past two years it is due largely to its practice of taking a broad overall view of problems rather than trying to solve individual problems separately.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> added that the Government took the same approach to the question of land reform. The largest regions of Viet-Nam have in the past been the least populated, due partly to the existence of large absentee land holdings and partly to the French colonial practice of keeping large areas unexploited. The land reform program envisages installing families in these areas and providing each family with a house and two or three hectares of land. These families would cooperate with each other to work their land and would gradually accumulate small savings which could then be invested in the industrialization of the country. Furthermore, being on the land and raising their own crops, they would be able to survive periods of depression, since people who own their own land are not likely to starve in bad times. By their very presence in these areas they would deny the use of them to Communist forces, thus the land reform program had social, economic, and strategic implications.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> felt that since 1956 Communist strategy in the Far East had changed. Before 1956 the Communists stressed peaceful coexistence and the relaxation of tensions. Since 1956 they stressed aggressive coexistence which they preferred to describe as competitive co-existence. They also devoted much attention to aid given “without <pb xml:id="pg_772" n="772" facs="0802"/>conditions”. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> realized that the United States had been giving aid to countries of Europe and Asia since 1945 and therefore foreign aid was an old and rather fatiguing thing for Americans. For the Communists, on the other hand, it was a brand new development. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> said that our studies of some of the Communist aid programs which were described as “without conditions” showed that there were in fact a great many strings attached to these programs. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> replied that he was well aware of this but that the point he wanted to make was that the Communists were new entries in the foreign aid field.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> next raised the question of complicated U.S. aid procedures which he said should be simplified. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> replied that the Vietnamese were not the only ones to complain about complicated U.S. procedures and that we were making a determined effort to reduce details resulting from these procedures. There was a basic problem, however, which, while not excusing lengthy aid procedures, could to some extent explain them. This basic problem was that he was required to justify to the Congress in detail the expenditure of aid funds. This requirement necessitated the extensive documentation of aid projects. Tomorrow morning, for example, he had to go before a Congressional committee and explain in detail actions taken by his predecessor in a certain country some time ago. A certain delay also arose inevitably from the great distance between Washington and Saigon and the long time needed for correspondence between the two places. Also, although this did not necessarily apply to Viet-Nam, sometimes the host governments were slow in taking necessary action and this slowness caused additional delay. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName> laughed out loud at this point and said this was the counter-attack. He then interrupted the translation to explain to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> that the Government of Viet-Nam had at times been delinquent in this regard.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said that being at the very edge of the Communist world, Viet-Nam could never lose sight of the fact that most of its problems assumed a military character. It was with this thought in mind and not with any desire to try to match the extremely large Communist army that President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would like to raise the armed forces ceiling by adding 20,000 more men. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> remarked that we were well aware of the military threat posed by Communism and it was for this reason that we were spending large sums in such places as the Far East and it was also for this reason that we urged united action for defense on countries which were so threatened. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> then said Viet-Nam was like a person who had just recovered from a serious illness and was still convalescent. Treatment was still necessary but strong remedies should be avoided since they might have an undesirable effect on the convalescent patient. He then remarked <pb xml:id="pg_773" n="773" facs="0803"/>that Viet-Nam hoped to make the most efficacious use of American aid because it was very conscious of its obligation toward the free world and realized that making the best use of American aid would be helping not only itself but the rest of the free world. Viet-Nam would like to be a model of a small country receiving American aid. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> said that we were very proud of the fact that we had helped a fine man like President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> to accomplish so much and that we admired President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> greatly. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> was frequently called upon in special discussions before Congressional committees and elsewhere to cite examples of what the mutual security program had accomplished. His favorite example which he always cited was Viet-Nam. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName> said that President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could never have accomplished what he did without American aid, for which the Vietnamese were extremely grateful.</p>

</list>
<p>After the usual exchange of amenities Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said he proposed to discuss military aid to Viet-Nam under two general aspects, the political and the technical. He found that since December 1956 when the Communist Party Congress took place in Peiping, Communist techniques in the Far East had changed. The Moscow 20th Party Congress had stressed the parliamentary struggle for the spread of Communism. However, Mao Tse Tung had reconsidered Communist strategy and tactics. He gave stress to the following three ideas: (1) Communist orthodoxy; (2) dictatorship of the proletariat; (3) the necessity to establish this dictatorship by violent means. The Vietnamese <pb xml:id="pg_774" n="774" facs="0804"/>Communists (Lao Dong party) conform to the Chinese view in this regard.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> asked how many members there were in the Vietnamese Communist Party. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> replied that, although the Communists probably claimed a great many, the total membership of the Lao Party was probably between 300,000 and 400,000.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> asked if there was any considerable refugee movement from north to south in Viet-Nam. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> replied that there was still a remarkably strong desire among people in the north to go south. The Vietnamese Government had under study a secret project which it hoped to put into effect at some time in the future after it had succeeded in consolidating the south politically, economically, and militarily. This plan would call for provoking within a few weeks a massive exodus of up to two million refugees from the north to the south.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said that the current Asian Communist line was affected strongly by a certain dynamism among the Asian masses. These masses wanted an improvement in their lot and they wanted it quickly. The Chinese Communists recognized the existence of this ferment and hoped to capture the leadership of it rather than to be swept along by it. Therefore the time factor is most important now. The Communists hoped to outstrip the West in the race for control of the Asian masses by taking advantage of the slowness of the democratic countries.</p>
<p>It is against this Asian background that the Vietnamese regard the technical aspect of their military problem. In general their role as envisaged by <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> is to delay any massive military attack by the Vietnamese Communists. The Vietnamese Communists have 380,000 men organized into heavy divisions and equipped in accordance with Chinese and Russian practice with a strong artillery. Free Viet-Nam has only 150,000 men, most of whom are organized in light divisions. In addition to all this, recent developments in Laos and Cambodia indicating a general trend toward increased Communist influence in those countries make it necessary for the Vietnamese to concern themselves with a much larger area of possible operations than had been anticipated. In order to fill their responsibilities under the framework of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> the Vietnamese must have sufficient forces to resist for from two weeks to a month the shock of Communist forces which will be determined to crush them as rapidly as possible. Therefore, from the technical point of view they need sufficient troops to form two army corps, sufficient troops to organize their army into divisions and sufficient troops to carry on training without diminishing the operational capacity of their army. In response to a question from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> estimated the average Vietnamese light division at 6,000 men and the average Vietnamese Communist <pb xml:id="pg_775" n="775" facs="0805"/>division at about 12,000 men. Captain Robbins agreed with this estimate. For all of the foregoing reasons, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>, President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> asked 20,000 to 30,000 more men so that he could carry on training and maintain two army corps at the same time. The Vietnamese did not view their mission simply as a delaying one, but felt that after resisting the initial shock they must counterattack quickly. There were compelling political reasons for this. It would not be desirable, either from the American point of view or from the Vietnamese point of view, to send American troops into Viet-Nam since this would be, after all, a civil war.</p>
<p>Vietnamese troops would have to be the ones to attack the Viet Minh. The Vietnamese must think in terms of organizing landings and attacking the enemy in the region of Hanoi itself. So, it is Vietnamese troops that will have to carry the load. For the moment, Thailand and the Philippines, the only countries that could help Viet-Nam with troops, have none to spare. Thailand, particularly, has the dangerous right bank of the Mekong to watch. Therefore, the Vietnamese national army must be made adequate to meet the current situation.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> whether or not the Vietnamese army had made any progress. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> replied that the Vietnamese army had made much progress in the past two years, both technically and in morale. Its main weaknesses are in equipment, especially in transportation, in which it is very backward. Its trucks and jeeps are left over from the last war and are very worn. To remedy their main deficiencies they must concentrate on training and equipment.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> asked how the economic situation was in Viet-Nam. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said it was bad because of 15 years of war and destruction. The Government was now devoting its main attention to economic recovery. They realized that economically also they were in competition with the Communists, that there was in fact a race between the Communist world and the free world for the Asian masses.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> asked what the population of Free Viet-Nam was. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> estimated it at about 12,000,000 as compared to about 14,000,000 in the Communist Zone but said that the Government of Viet-Nam could reverse this situation in about two or three weeks by implementing at an appropriate time the secret plan he had earlier mentioned. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> remarked, semi-humorously, that under such circumstances, having the population advantage, Free Viet-Nam could readily accept the idea of free elections throughout the country. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> asked under what circumstances free elections could be possible throughout Free Viet-Nam. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> remarked that it was not possible to have free elections under a Communist regime and that the Communists didn’t even dare to have elections under <pb xml:id="pg_776" n="776" facs="0806"/>their own auspices because people were so dissatisfied. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName> agreed that free elections would never be possible under a Communist regime and pointed out that in 1945 even with a Chinese Nationalist army present in North Viet-Nam the Communists had been able to carry out rigged elections.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> asked when the next elections would be held for Free Viet-Nam. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said in about four years, that is, there would be parliamentary elections every four years and presidential elections every five years. This was why the Vietnamese attached such importance to their five-year plan. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s idea was to leave his successor a simplified situation with which he would be able to cope. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was against the idea of having a president eligible for reelection since this might result in the acceptance of a president who was too old to cope with the difficult problems which Viet-Nam would always have because of her geographical position. But the National Assembly overruled Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and provided that a president could serve two terms. In Vietnamese tradition there is no cult of personality such as that which surrounded Stalin, for example, and no hereditary nobility. Even the emperors of Annam did not have personal authority but had to act only with the advice of the government. In the old times the Government of Viet-Nam was a government of the average man, a system which has both advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> said that the people and the Government of the United States were very impressed by the job which the people and the Government of Viet-Nam had done. We tried to understand Viet-Nam’s problems and were anxious to do all we could to help. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> replied that the Vietnamese saw their problems within the framework of all Southeast Asia and that if they had had some success to date it was thanks to American aid and to their own broad concept of their problems. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> could be sure that we would listen sympathetically to the Vietnamese Government’s presentation of its military aid problems.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Proposal to Send a <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Bell</persName>-Type Mission to Viet-Nam.</item>
</list>
<p>Attached is an exchange of memoranda<note n="2" xml:id="d368fn2">Not attached to the source text.</note> with <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> beginning in December 1955 on the question of a <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Bell</persName>-type mission to Viet-Nam. At his request this file was brought to Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>’s attention on April 3.</p>
<p>As this file indicates, the Department has felt that in order to put the aid program in Viet-Nam on a more realistic basis a small group of competent individual experts headed by a personality of sufficient eminence to claim the respect arid attention of the United States-Vietnamese Governments should be sent to Viet-Nam in order to recommend policy decisions to be taken with regard to the aid program.</p>
<p>The exchange of views with <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> was briefly as follows:</p>
<list>
<item>1. On December 8, 1955, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> sent a memorandum to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName><note n="3" xml:id="d368fn3">See <ref target="#d277fn7">footnote 7, Document 277</ref>.</note> with a detailed enclosure referring to Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>’s recommendation for a special mission to Viet-Nam and stating that there would be considerable merit in sending such a mission provided its members were carefully selected and the terms of reference well thought out. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> recommended that a special economic mission be sent to Viet-Nam and that the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> Special Working Group prepare a report on long-range planning for Viet-Nam, Cambodia, and Laos and discuss the terms of a special mission.</item>
<item>2. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> replied on January 20, 1956,<note n="4" xml:id="d368fn4">See <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.</note> that it might be better to postpone sending a special mission to Viet-Nam pending completion of surveys under way. These included a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> technical assistance mission requested by the Vietnamese Government, a prospective <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> Mission, and a costing study then being undertaken by a small working party from Defense, State, and <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>. State Department officials discussed the State Department proposals for a mission with <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> officials and agreed to defer pushing the project until <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> officials had returned from Viet-Nam.</item>
<item>3. On May 15, 1956, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> followed up his January memorandum with a brief note to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> saying that he wondered if it would be wise to appoint still another mission. He enclosed <pb xml:id="pg_778" n="778" facs="0808"/>an internal <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> memorandum listing various types of surveys and describing the nature of the <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Bell</persName> Mission to the Philippines in 1950.<note n="5" xml:id="d368fn5">The <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> memorandum and the internal <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> memorandum are attached to a memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName>, May 24, 1956, not printed. (Washington National Records Center, <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> Director’s Files: <gloss target="#t_FRC1">FRC</gloss> 61 A 32, Box 313, Vietnam)</note></item>
<item>4. On July 25, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> replied to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName><note n="6" xml:id="d368fn6">The <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> memorandum and the accompanying memorandum are not printed. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.5–MSP/7–2556)</note> stating that the Department of State continued to believe that a special mission was desirable and asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> to reconsider his view expressed in his memorandum of May 15. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> also attached a short memorandum on implementation of a mission to Viet-Nam.</item>
<item>5. On October 2, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> replied<note n="7" xml:id="d368fn7">Not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.5–MSP/10–256)</note> suggesting that it might be better to defer any further action on a special mission until various investigations by <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> and by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee were completed.</item>
<item>6. As pointed out below, the State Department as yet has not replied to that letter but has agreed as an interim measure to the sending of an evaluation team to Viet-Nam provided it is staffed with several outstanding experts in economic development and fiscal affairs.</item>
</list>
<p>The proposal for a <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Bell</persName>-type mission has been opposed by <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> for various reasons, including: 1) it would undermine the authority of our existing missions in Saigon; 2) it would lead the Vietnamese to expect a larger aid program; 3) it should await the results of studies by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> missions, and 4) it should await the results of studies of our overall foreign aid program by the Administration and by Congress.</p>
<p>The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> mission prepared its report in late 1956 but up to the present time the Vietnamese Government has successfully opposed its publication and we have been able to receive only bootleg copies of this report. The <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> group visited Viet-Nam in February 1957 but some of the members have not yet returned and its report has not yet been published. The <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> inspection team is due to leave for Viet-Nam next week but so far has no members in addition to the usual team of two men.</p>
<p>After a lengthy discussion within the Department, it was decided not to send a formal reply to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName>’s latest memorandum on this subject dated October 2, 1956. Rather, oral discussions were held with Dr. Moyer and Mr. Wood of <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> and agreement reached to add personnel to the regular inspection team which <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> was scheduled to send to Viet-Nam in early April.</p>
<p>I recommend in view of the above that you discuss this matter with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName>, pointing out the renewed inquiry by Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>, and urge on him the necessity of securing one or two top-flight <pb xml:id="pg_779" n="779" facs="0809"/>economists to go to Viet-Nam immediately and join the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> inspection group.</p>

<p>After discussion of the question of land reform in Vietnam at the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> meeting on February 20, a Department of State draft of this telegram was cleared through <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> up to <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName>, who reversed his agency’s preliminary approval and vetoed the entire program. Department of State officials were informed that <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> feared disapproval of a U.S. program designed to pay for private land transfers in Vietnam at a time when general aid programs were coming under increasing criticism, especially in Congress. The Department of State countered that land reform was necessary to strengthen the Government of South Vietnam, to combat Communist influence, and to increase internal security. The Department suggested that U.S. aid funds equal to 5 percent of the cost of the land transfer payments ($3.5 to $4.5 million) be used as a catalyst to get the program started.

<p>3. Procedure as set out above based on assumption that piaster costs to be met by United States would be $3.5 million with French and Vietnamese contributing $1.75 million each based on an estimated 600,000 hectares of land to be distributed. Timing of this additional United States piaster cost under caveat para 4 below would be $1.5 million piasters <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 and $2 million <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 from dollar funds of existing appropriations and appropriations for those respective fiscal years as necessary. However if Vietnamese can get program underway rapidly some counterpart funds could be made available during <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957.</p>
<p>4. In your discussions with Vietnamese you should point out we are not now in position to authorize commitment of dollar funds beyond Fiscal Year 1957 and you should avoid explicit or implicit commitment of United States to furnish dollars or piasters whose availability depends on future appropriations. Rather you may suggest to Vietnamese that if Congress appropriates funds for aid to Viet-Nam in Fiscal Years 1958 and 1959 United States would react favorably to Vietnamese request for assistance to meet costs administration land reform program and other development program items in Viet-Nam budget per para 2 above.</p>
<p>5. You may inform Vietnamese United States prepared meet costs administration land reform program in Fiscal Year 1957 within existing programmed funds.</p>
<p>6. We believe certain corollary actions by Vietnamese Government required if proposed program to be successful. Therefore, Vietnamese Government should give assurances it will make every effort improve and expand its agricultural extension service, agricultural credit facilities, and farm cooperatives.</p>

<p>Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>: Recent developments have brought about a new urgency in resolving the problem of the ceiling on U.S. military personnel in Viet-Nam. You will remember that by interdepartmental <pb xml:id="pg_781" n="781" facs="0811"/>agreement early in 1956 there was established a ceiling of 692, which includes 342 for the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and 350 for <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss>, the Temporary Equipment Recovery Mission.</p>
<p>Two facets of the problem now point to the necessity of doing away with the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> ceiling and permitting the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force to augment <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Viet-Nam with the additional personnel necessary to accomplish the mission there.</p>
<p>The first aspect is that raised in the telegram from the Embassy in Saigon to the Department of State, 2772, of 12 March 1957, which points out that the International Control Commission is becoming increasingly more restive in respect to <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> and recommends consideration of several courses of action.<note n="2" xml:id="d370fn2">The four recommendations of possible courses of action in this telegram were: 1) continuation of exchange-of-letters exercise conceding nothing, making no commitments, and hedging on details and assurances; 2) gradual withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss>; 3) general compliance with <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> demands and controls on <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss>; and 4) abolishment of <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> and corresponding increase in <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Vietnam or creation of new permanent mission to perform <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss>’s functions. The Embassy recommended the third of these courses for the “immediate future, with serious consideration” of the second and fourth options “as eventual alternatives. It increasingly difficult and embarassing to maintain indefinitely a mission, mainly engaged in training, under guise of a temporary mission solely concerned with recovery and out-shipment equipment.” (Department of State, Central Files, 751.5–MSP/3–1257)</note> The Department of Defense concurred in the April 9 Department of State telegram to Saigon<note n="3" xml:id="d370fn3">The reference is to telegram 2630 to Saigon, April 9, not printed. (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.)</note> which stated that a solution of the problem along the lines of incorporating <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> into an increased <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> was under study and that the Department of State would discuss the problem with the Canadians, British, French, and Indians. This telegram was the result of a conference on March 20 of staff representatives of the two departments in which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> participated.</p>
<p>The second aspect of the problem is the necessity for taking over the training of the Vietnamese Navy and Air Force. It will be remembered that <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> was created for a dual purpose, to provide a logistical organization to resolve the problems of excess property in Indochina and logistical training in Viet-Nam, and to free the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> from other duties so that its personnel could concentrate on the training of the Vietnamese Army. The withdrawal of the French Army training personnel required this increased emphasis on training. In the telegram from Chief, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Viet-Nam 5607 of 4 April,<note n="4" xml:id="d370fn4">Not printed. (Center of Military History, <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName> Papers, <gloss target="#t_TWXS1">TWX</gloss>s 1957 (14))</note> we have been informed that President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> told the Chief, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> that agreement had been reached with the French Ambassador for the withdrawal of the French Air Force and Navy training missions upon the completion of the present courses of instruction. The first completion is scheduled for this month, and additional U.S. military personnel will be required to pick up the training <pb xml:id="pg_782" n="782" facs="0812"/>from the French. <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> has requested in his 062352Z of 6 April<note n="5" xml:id="d370fn5">Not printed. (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.)</note> that additional personnel over and above the present ceiling reach Viet-Nam in June of this year.</p>
<p>Other aspects of the problem of the ceiling include a request from President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> for additional Army instructors at the Viet-Nam military academy, a proposal by <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> to transfer underway training of the Vietnamese Navy from Subie Bay to Viet-Nam, and the current difficulty in operating <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> efficiently within their present ceilings.</p>
<p>An increase in <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> strength to achieve a rapid improvement in the effectiveness of Vietnamese forces to compensate for the withdrawal of French forces is considered a matter of urgency. While the French have withdrawn approximately 190,000 regular troops from Viet-Nam since the Geneva Agreement was signed the Viet Minh have continuously reorganized and re-equipped their forces during the same period so as to increase their regular combat strength from six to eighteen divisions. These forces have a capability of conducting combat operations at Corps level. The Vietnamese Army consists of ten divisions which are in the early stages of training at regimental and division level. The current military situation requires that the Vietnamese armed forces expeditiously attain a satisfactory level of combat effectiveness.</p>
<p>In view of the forthcoming visit of President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to Washington on May 8th, 9th, and 10th and of the impending training crises for the Vietnamese Navy and Air Force I recommend that steps be taken as a matter of urgency to secure the necessary international concurrences in the abolition of the ceiling on <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Viet-Nam. I feel it might be desirable to have this problem resolved, if possible, prior to the arrival of President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in Washington so that he could be informed at that time of our plans to assist him in the training of his Navy and Air Force.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Report of Chief of Staff’s Trip to the Far East Southeast Asia, and Pacific Areas, 16 March–12 April 1957</item>
</list>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">X. Vietnam</p>
<p>A. Briefing, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Vietnam Staff, 1420–1450 Hours, 29 March 1957.</p>
<p>This briefing consisted of a review of the mission, organization, over all problems and their status with respect to <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Vietnam, Major points developed in the briefing were:</p>
<p>1. There are four principal areas in which <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Vietnam operations are different from other <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>s:</p>
<list>
<item>a. The international ceiling which is imposed upon the number of U.S. military personnal which may be used as advisors to Vietnam (this by terms of the Geneva Accords) is not predicated upon any sound basis.</item>
<item>b. Whereas other <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>s are engaged in bringing <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> matériel into a country, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Vietnam has the additional responsibility of out-shipping <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss>.</item>
<item>c. While other <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>s are associated with countries building up to reach a certain force goal, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Vietnam is operating in an aftermath of the Indochina War and the Vietnamese are in the process of reducing a force goal.</item>
<item>d. The combined training mission assigned since 28 April 1956, the date of dissolution of the French High Command. The French are no longer associated with the training of Vietnamese Army troop units. This function is assigned to <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Vietnam. However, the French are associated with training Navy and Air Force Vietnamese units.</item>
</list>
<p>2. Fortunately, the Temporary Equipment Recovery Mission (<gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss>), arrived to assume its function at the peak of equipment deliveries scheduled for the Vietnamese Army. <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> has declared excesses for outshipment in amount of $132 million. $100 million worth of equipment has actually been out-shipped and $13.4 million has been disposed of locally.</p>
<p>3. A 150,000 man force goal has been approved for the Vietnamese Armed Forces. This is contrasted against the recommended force <pb xml:id="pg_784" n="784" facs="0814"/>basis of 170,000 men suggested by <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, Vietnam. Present training of this 150,000 force basis is aimed at internal security with the development of a capability of limited initial resistance against aggression. The Army will be composed of three-year volunteers and two-year conscripts. In order to get in within the 150,000 force basis, the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> proposes to recommend reduction in the number of territorial regiments proposed in the force structure from 13 to 7.</p>
<p>4. Vietnam, for defense, is divided into regions. Division forces are stationed in each of the four principal regions. All decisions regaring the Armed Forces are made personally by President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and control is closely centralized. The defenses are predicated upon a delaying action falling back on the defenses of Saigon. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> is seeking to correct this defensive concept which stems basically from the French. He hopes to develop a revised concept based upon the employment of mobile reinforcements and fighting the divisions as units rather than the parceled out “Beau Jests [<hi rend="italic">Beau Geste</hi>]” pattern of fighting now visualized.</p>
<p>5. <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Advisors are located at the following levels: <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> General Staff, U.S. <gloss target="#t_HQ1">HQ</gloss>, Military Regional <gloss target="#t_HQ1">HQ</gloss>, Field Divisions, Light Divisions, Territorial Regiments, Military Schools, Training Centers and logistical installations.</p>
<p>6. The Geneva Accords preclude the introduction of new equipment and replacement of that presently there except on a piece-for-piece basis. Though the U.S. is not a signatory to these Accords, and there is no requirement to abide by them, we have so far. The first real test of what we must do will come with equipment to be provided under the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 57 program. New equipment is included in this program, which may not be introduced under a strict interpretation of the Accords.</p>
<p>7. There has been a significant increase in school training. 437 spaces were requested for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 56 as contrasted with 1247 requested in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 57.</p>
<p>8. Training is interrupted by operations against sects, requirements for reorganization and regrouping, inadequacy of training facilities and the necessity for construction of temporary housing.</p>
<p>9. Internal security forces presently number 23,000. 27,000 are authorized. These are organized into units to provide local security. It is hoped that once the internal security forces have developed an organization, is properly commanded and trained, this force can relieve the Vietnamese Army of internal security commissions now being performed by the regular forces. They will need some equipment principally rifles and the like. Ammunition will be a problem as there are no war reserves built up in Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> believes that the internal security force should be supported to the extent of being provided with small weapons. 27 Advisors from Michigan <pb xml:id="pg_785" n="785" facs="0815"/>State University are in Vietnam working on this organization. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> is not sure as to just what they are doing. He seemed to feel that they were getting into his field.</p>
<p>10. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has recently undertaken a project of resettlement in the plateau area. This is handled on a land-grant basis by giving ex-soldiers and ex-members of the internal security force parcels of land for resettlement homesites. Approximately 45,000 people have been so settled. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> feels that this is particularly advantageous as a buffer against communist infiltration.</p>
<p>11. In referring to the organization of the Vietnamese Light Division, <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> felt that the structure seemed grossly out of balance. He observed that the subordinate units would not be capable of independent operations. He suggested that <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> have a look at the battle group type of organization proposed for the new Airborne Division. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> replied that he was looking this organization over carefully but that he had not discussed it with the Vietnamese because of the conflict which would be presented with his efforts to get them to think in terms of division units rather than small separate units. He wants to get them away from the separate battalion type fighting. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> said he agreed with <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName>’ approach.</p>
<p>12. In response to a question from <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> as to whether or not the defense of Vietnam had been war-gamed, <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> replied in the negative. The Vietnamese have not yet arrived at that stage in defensive planning.</p>
<p>13. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> then inquired as to the length of service required in the Vietnamese Army. He was told that the length of service is three years. The Vietnamese have not yet developed what could be considered as a hard core nucleus in the Vietnamese Army because of the turnover which has been characterized in the past. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> thought that the long-term prospects of developing such were excellent. In response to a question from <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> regarding the situation along the 17th parallel, <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> told him that the situation there is completely unlike that of the demilitarized zone in Korea. Most of the Viet-Minh forces are concentrated in the Hanoi area with civilian police patrols manning the border. It is not too difficult to secure passage from North to South Vietnam. Infiltrators and line crossers are introduced in this manner.</p>
<p>14. In regard to the problem of the language barrier among the Vietnamese students attending <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss> schools, <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> was told that special translators are provided for courses at these schools. Meanwhile, the Vietnamese are concentrating on English language training in their military schools.</p>
<p>B. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> called upon President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, the U.S. Ambassador, the Chief of Staff of the Vietnamese Army and visited the Vietnamese <pb xml:id="pg_786" n="786" facs="0816"/>Army Basic Training Center and Logistical installations. He conferred with General Festing,<note n="2" xml:id="d371fn2">General Sir Francis Festing.</note> <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> British Forces, Far East, and talked to the officers of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Vietnam from 1030–1100 hours, 30 March.</p>
<p>C. Major points of discussion between <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, 29 March.</p>
<p>1. Present:</p>
<list>
<item>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName></item>
<item><persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName></item>
<item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ADV1">Anderson</persName> (American Chargé d’Affaires)<note n="3" xml:id="d371fn3"><persName corresp="#p_ADV1">Daniel V. Anderson</persName>’s permanent title was Counselor of Embassy.</note></item>
<item><persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Lt General Williams</persName> (Chief of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, Vietnam)</item>
</list>
<p>2. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> made a point that the U.S. supported ceiling for the Vietnamese forces should be increased from 150,000 to 160,000 in order to increase elements of the Armed forces, such as the Navy, which he considers to be under manned. In support of his views, he pointed out the discrepancy in size of forces between Free Vietnam and North Vietnam and mentioned that he had recently read that the Chinese were furnishing 200 gun boats to the Viet Minh Naval Forces.</p>
<p>3. He made a point for increased local procurement in Vietnam by the U.S. Forces as a means of building up Vietnamese industry.</p>
<p>4. He discussed the disagreement with <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> on the priority of road building within Vietnam. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> supported by <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> considers that the strategic road running from east to west and making junction with the Coastal Road No. 1 should be given priority. <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>, on the other hand, felt that first priority should be for Road No. 1 running north and south along the coast.</p>
<p>5. He reviewed the politico-military situation in Laos and Cambodia. He expressed in this review grave reservations concerning the communist threat in these countries and the threats which communist infiltration presented to the security of Vietnam.</p>
<p>6. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is not satisfied with the French Mission in Vietnam. He said he contemplated ending this mission at the end of the present course at the General Staff College which will take place in April. There are approximately 200 French personnel in this Mission.</p>
<p>7. He spoke of the activities of the International Control Commission and said that there was some talk among the Indian and Canadian members of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> that it may be withdrawn in July of this year. He said that recently the Commission had decided to move to Saigon from its former location in Hanoi. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> posts along the Vietnamese-Chinese Border were completely inadequate to contol such a long stretch of territory and <pb xml:id="pg_787" n="787" facs="0817"/>added that the communist members of the Commission bring up frequent fictitious complaints in order to visit areas in Vietnam.</p>

<p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Internal Political</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> undisputed leader of country. Although obviously respected he does not enjoy nation-wide popularity. Government policies reflect his convictions and attitudes his thinking still largely conditioned by sense of general vulnerability of Vietnam which he destined save. From this view have flowed two major preoccupations:</p>
<list>
<item>a. Need for centralization. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has achieved primary goals of establishing his firm control over central government and in general government’s authority over entire national territory.</item>
<item>b. Need for security. Although large measure security achieved, isolated but not insignificant acts of violence still occur and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> views certain undeveloped areas highly vulnerable to penetration. Despite improvement over last year, present Communist and sect subversive capabilities undoubtedly remain important, particularly if supported from Cambodia. Attempted assassination at Banmethuot has strengthened his fears. He has become more intolerant of dissenting opinions, keener to force through his program of settlements in border and highland areas and to strengthen his security forces.</item>

<pb xml:id="pg_788" n="788" facs="0818"/>
<p>In carrying out policies <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, distrustful by nature, continues rely heavily on small circle of advisers including members of his family.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s rigidity in pursuing goals and brooking no opposition has alienated many able persons. He has antagonized in varying degrees the Chinese and certain Catholic elements and has not yet sought regain loyalty defeated <persName corresp="#p_PCTCDP1">Cao Dai</persName> and Hoa Hao. Policy towards Chinese (citizenship law combined with exclusion foreigners from eleven occupations) aimed at breaking Chinese hold over economy threatens some possible economic disorganization and serious damage prestige of Taipei to advantage of Peiping among Chinese Vietnam. Dominant position of family has with some justification made it natural target of criticism and, although <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> himself above suspicion, some members family often accused of corruption.</p>
<p>Although successes over past year remarkable and degree of stability and security achieved now make long-term planning possible, regime still not successful in overcoming native complacency and generating broad popular support or enthusiasm. In event <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> disappeared, most probable Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> could take over but with army arbiter of situation. Embassy knows of no other figure capable of effectively replacing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. Despite fragility regime, strength of country far greater than that of others in area and greatly improved during past year.</p>
<p>Assuming present regime able remain in power and maintain security long-term strength of regime and ultimate public support will depend on its capacity show appreciable rate of progress and thereby effectively compete with north. This <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> understands and now most concerned obtain early results in social and economic fields. He has repeatedly stated in past year that north-south contest moving from phase of military propaganda to one of economic competition.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">2. International</p>
<p>Relations with France have improved appreciably over past year though still subject to fluctuations. French have decided withdraw military contingent from Seno supply base at Saigon and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has requested withdrawal of French navy and air force training missions, which will mean virtual elimination French military from Vietnam. If other irritating problem of transfer of common properties can be solved quickly, believe there chance of more fruitful development relations in economic and cultural fields. However, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> remains deeply distrustful of French and this attitude is shared or reflected by most top officials. He is particularly bitter about machinations in Cambodia and Laos of French “colonialist” officials.</p>
<p><gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> continues snub <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> by delaying send Minister to Taipei although Chinese Minister Yuan arrived Saigon January 8. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> <pb xml:id="pg_789" n="789" facs="0819"/>policies this matter and re Chinese Vietnam may well affect <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> prestige in area. However <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> determined rectify special privileged position Chinese obtained under French. He considers that Nationalist China has no influence on local Chinese, a few whom are Communists and many fence sitters secretly proud of China’s newly won “independence.”</p>
<p>Relations with Japan have not been cordial and question of reparations remains unsolved. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> fears Japanese economic penetration as prelude to political domination and there are indications <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> may try boycott Japanese goods.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> increasingly concerned developments Laos and Cambodia. He appears convinced Communists coordinating subversion efforts Vietnam from Cambodia. He sought recently through <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_SN1">Sihanouk</persName> meeting reach reconciliation of differences with Cambodia and there are indications of some progress.<note n="3" xml:id="d372fn3">Acting Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName> met with <persName corresp="#p_SN1">Sihanouk</persName> at Siem Reap March 2–4 for discussions on current Vietnamese-Cambodian political-military affairs. (Weeka 10, telegram 2736 from Saigon, March 9; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 751G.00(W)/3–1157)</note></p>
<p>Relationship with Laos considerably easier than with Cambodia. Nevertheless, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> currently worried that Petsarath may become Prime Minister and make coalition deal with Pathet Lao that will result Communist domination Laos and consequent threat <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
<p>President has continued to seek greater support from countries this area to build up position <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> against <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and had planned number of short official visits. First one scheduled for Philippines cancelled by Magsaysay’s untimely death.<note n="4" xml:id="d372fn4">On March 17.</note> Vietnam has succeeded in having <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> members take its participation under consideration and has also continued making effort to be represented at maximum number international conferences where it has sent generally able representatives. It now seems certain Colombo Plan Consultative Committee will meet here in autumn.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Economic</p>
<p>Economic situation good and progress made during past two years remarkable. This year government operating under well-prepared balanced budget (including aid) approved by National Assembly February along with new taxes designed increase revenues and siphon off windfall profits. On strictly government account, government cash expenditures have been covered by cash receipts, including US assistance on military expenditures, for last 13 months. In foreign exchange field, limited-access market has provided means for profit transfers. In import licensing, improvements have begun to result in increased arrival of merchandise. Local money market presently <pb xml:id="pg_790" n="790" facs="0820"/>so tight that National Bank credit at five percent will soon be required.</p>
<p>Retail and wholesale price indices at end of 1956 declined to levels of September 1955 and are still generally stable. Supplies of goods more than adequate in most categories.</p>
<p>Agricultural production continuing increase in most lines. Exports of rubber, rice and miscellaneous commodities, most of which enjoy special exchange rate, expected to increase value or level of imports not expected increase and will continue function in generating piasters to support military and economic programs.</p>
<p>Announcement of satisfactory investment policy seemed to offer possibility of improving investment climate. However, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> attitude towards specific pending private investments (<gloss target="#t_Toica1">Toica</gloss> 1550 of April 26)<note n="5" xml:id="d372fn5">Not printed. (Washington National Records Center, <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> Message Files: <gloss target="#t_FRC1">FRC</gloss> 58 A 403, Box 173, Saigon)</note> indicates for time being policy not likely to be applied. Prospective early conclusion <gloss target="#t_FCN1">FCN</gloss> treaty with US will be helpful.</p>
<p>Some new native small-scale investment appears be taking place while several foreign investors showing interest. Barring unforeseen developments Vietnam should show continuing economic progress in 1957. This year first time <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has been able concentrate on economic problems and begin to think in terms of long-range program economic development looking toward achievement self-sustained economic growth.</p>
<p>American economic aid programs likely continue have important beneficial effect in basic fields of transport, education, public health, agriculture and selected industries.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Military</p>
<p>Steadily improving Vietnamese military posture now assures fulfillment of internal security mission and allows greater emphasis on defense against external aggression. However true value of progress lies not in physical improvements but in fact military forces are in state of transition. Previously self-satisfied military beginning become aware of weaknesses. Understanding and acceptance facts of situation, close cooperation with <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss>, willingness correct deficiencies, realization need for austerity lay foundation for progress in all fields.</p>
<p>However, low education level, lack of command and planning experience, paucity of technical know-how and long acceptance of low standards cannot be quickly overcome. Following are major problems and prospects for solution:</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_791" n="791" facs="0821"/>
<list>
<item>a. Defense planning gradually becoming competent and realistic but will continue inadequate until efforts all <gloss>SEA</gloss> nations are integrated. <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> remains key to establishment required solidarity.</item>
<item>b. President and some members his staff realize need for plans mobilize all resources in defense Vietnam. Such plans beginning to be developed. Current conscription planning may soon be implemented and eventually result in creation reserve force which will strengthen defense and ultimately permit adjustments in structure all armed forces in line with local support capabilities.</item>
<item>c. Deficiencies in administration, ill-drawn command lines, and inadequate documentation are being met by rewritting tables of organization and by joint <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> [<hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss></hi>] development new overall organizational concept to define lines of responsibility and functions.</item>
<item>d. Progress against low-education level expected through maximum use off-shore schools, development local schools, and possible employment US instructors in military academy which has agreed adopt four year curriculum. Plans drawn up to conduct special training course in Thailand and air–ground operations course in Okinawa to develop Vietnamese potential. Air–ground operations training will be given at San Diego to cross-train key Vietnamese officer graduates of US schools.</item>
<item>e. Military efforts to bring full internal security to highlands include major program of psychological action, coordinated with US and Vietnamese civil program.</item>
<item>f. Expected early departure French air and naval training missions will add to <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> burden and require limited increase personnel. If this personnel provided together with Vietnamese graduates of US schools, expect no difficulty assuming present French responsibilities and decided advantage having one doctrine and one set standards.</item>
<item>g. Plans drawn up for increasing naval shipyard capabilities to allow overhaul and repair all Vietnamese ships and some other Asian vessels with full operation of shipyard by fall 1957. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> desires use shipyard for development civilian capacity, dependent on development sound plans; therefore, no evident conflict with navy plans at present.</item>
<item>h. As yet no replacements programmed for F8/RF8 and L–19 aircraft scheduled for retirement from <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> inventory in June 1958 and 1959 respectively.</item>
<item>i. Efforts raise capabilities for aircraft overhaul recently assisted by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> allotment 10 million piasters to governmental owned Air Vietnam for technicians training and equipment. SAMAP is investigating overhaul capabilities Air Vietnam and is reported optimistic.</item>
<item>j. Problem improving airfield facilities being only partially met by <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>57 and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>58 civil aviation projects.</item>
<item>k. Modern fiscal and budget procedures being urged to improve previous inefficient system.</item>
<item>1. Control of logistics continues a major problem. General answer lies in pursuing actions already instituted by <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> and higher headquarters. Successful development logistical capability depends upon continued support of US and retention <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> at no less <pb xml:id="pg_792" n="792" facs="0822"/>than current strength plus augmentation to replace French training missions.</item>

<p>On May 5, President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and his party arrived in Honolulu and began a 21-day visit to the United States.

<p>Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName>; We are still studying long range solution of the <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> problems along the general lines set forth in the Department’s telegram 2630 of April 9<note n="2" xml:id="d374fn2">See <ref target="#d370fn3">footnote 3, Document 370</ref>.</note> and Embassy Saigon’s telegram 2772.<note n="3" xml:id="d374fn3">See footnote 2, <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.</note> The related problem, also described in your letter of April 15, which is presented by President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName>’s intention to send away the French air and naval training missions, is also being considered. This problem appears to be by itself considerably less urgent than the basic <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> problem since when the possibility of a French withdrawal of their air and naval missions arose last summer we made plans to assume the functions of those two missions within the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> ceiling should they be withdrawn.</p>
<p>The main problem as we see it remains the augmentation of the army training mission. The situation presented by the impending withdrawal of the French air and naval missions and the few French army personnel still in Viet-Nam should be regarded primarily as providing an additional reason for bringing about a solution of the army training problem.</p>
<p>As a first step toward finding a solution to this problem we intend informally to sound out the British, French, Canadians, and Indians in order to get some determination of their probable reaction to what would be for all practical purposes the incorporation of <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> into <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>. We would explain that <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss>’s original mission had almost been accomplished and that urgent new problems have arisen requiring new solutions. We would emphasize that the total number of technicians included in the newly organized <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> would be insignificant in comparison with the total number of French combat troops withdrawn since the armistice began. We would also stress the problem presented by the departure of the French air and naval training missions as well as the French elements still attached to army training facilities and the miscellaneous French elements whose presence in South Viet-Nam contributed to the performance of the French air and naval training missions.</p>
<p>This is, of course, an extremely delicate matter which will have to be worked out in terms of our relations with those friendly nations having an interest in the Geneva armistice control machinery <pb xml:id="pg_794" n="794" facs="0824"/>and in the light of our best estimate of the probable Communist reaction to the expansion of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>. For these reasons and in view of our Embassy’s warning in Embassy telegram 3079<note n="4" xml:id="d374fn4">Dated April 11, not printed. (Department of State, Central Files, 751.56351J/4–1157)</note> that prompt arrival of U.S. naval and air personnel would be a strain on our relations with the French and cause obvious problems with the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>, it seems impractical as well as undesirable to resolve this question prior to President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName>’s arrival in Washington on May 8. We hope, however, to commence our discussions with other friendly powers before that time and to talk with President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> about the whole problem during his visit.</p>

</list>
<p>After introductory remarks by the President praising President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> for the excellent achievements he has brought about in the last three years in stabilizing the situation in Viet-Nam, President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> <pb xml:id="pg_795" n="795" facs="0825"/>asked President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to outline the principal problems he is facing today.</p>
<p>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> replied that his country has gone through a very grave and serious crisis and has been able to hold on despite strong pressures from all sides. The principal problem of establishing internal security and building up their defense posture has been achieved to a considerable extent. The principal reason Viet-Nam has been able to hold out against these pressures has been because of the sympathy and encouragement given by the United States despite the fact that for a time even some people in the United States did not think that the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government could maintain itself.</p>
<p>At the present time Viet-Nam is faced with the possibility of a strong Communist offensive from the Vietminh who have 400 thousand men under arms. Fortunately, however, the Vietminh are faced with serious problems such as high taxes needed to maintain this large force and must have other controls which have caused discontent among the population in the North. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> feels that Red China is faced with the same problems. They are maintaining a large army which requires heavy taxes and controls over the people, which <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> hopes in the long run will force the Chinese Government to demobilize a considerable portion of their forces and treat the people in a more liberal manner. There is, nevertheless, the possibility that the Vietminh with their large army might try to attack now while they have a superiority in numbers. The Vietminh during the first year after the Geneva Conference did not think it would be necessary to use armed force to take over the South; they thought the government in the South would crumble and they could take over without difficulty. With internal stability in Free Viet-Nam and the build-up of their own armed forces, they have now the possibility of holding out for a few years more during which time <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> reiterated the strain and drain on the economy of the Vietminh may cause them to demobilize some of their forces and adopt a more liberal attitude toward the population.</p>
<p>Free Viet-Nam now has 150 thousand men under arms which has been the principal deterrent to an armed attack from the North. In order to put the Free Vietnamese forces on a more solid basis, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has recently decreed universal conscription. In three years, over two-thirds of the forces in Free Viet-Nam will be conscripts. This development will cut costs considerably since conscripts will only be paid about half as much as the regular troops are paid today.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the Free Vietnamese forces have been built up into a fairly strong organization, the structure of the army is not orthodox. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> pointed out that the figure of 150 thousand was arrived at during the time the French had considerable military influence in Viet-Nam and the French were convinced that it would not <pb xml:id="pg_796" n="796" facs="0826"/>be possible by training to make good soldiers out of the Vietnamese. The French, therefore, proposed the creation of a mixture of light (about 5500 men) and heavy (about 8600 men) divisions. Furthermore, the so-called heavy divisions were not really heavy in fact. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would like to have a more balanced military force by having the army made up of all heavy divisions of 10 thousand men each. In order to do this, the overall number of troops under arms should be raised by 20 thousand to 170 thousand. This increase can be brought about with the change over to conscription, without additional cost for the remainder of the calender year 1957, since there is enough material on hand for the initial equipping of the additional 20 thousand men. However, as the American military advisers in Viet-Nam know, a lot of the logistical support equipment is old and they do not have enough artillery. This, therefore, should be replaced as soon as possible. The Vietminh have three times as much artillery as Free Viet-Nam and with that they could probably break through the demarcation line at the 17th parallel.</p>
<p>In <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s opinion his main military requirement is ground forces. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is convinced that because of the poor visibility of low cloud cover prevailing through most of the year, it would be difficult if not impossible to give adequate air support to the ground forces. He is afraid, also, that any Vietminh-Communist attack would probably come down the Mekong River Valley through Laos, which is a scantily populated area where it would not be possible to use tactical atomic weapons since there would be no concentrated targets suitable for A-bomb attacks. He added that while the Laotians are sympathetic to the Vietnamese cause, they do not have a strong army and hope that the Vietnamese could help defend Laos. The Laotians, however, do not have too much courage and are intimidated by the presence of Red China to the North.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> then reiterated that Viet-Nam has attained stability due primarily to the volume of American aid. He pointed out that the magnitude of American aid permitted the US Government to have a large number of advisers and consultants in Viet-Nam who not only can assist Viet-Nam with its problems but also follow closely developments and the use to which aid is placed. In contrast, the small amounts of aid given to other countries, such as 20/30 million dollars, does not permit the US Government to maintain such close control over developments in other countries as is the case in Viet-Nam. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> pleaded for the maintenance of the present aid level of 250 million dollars a year of which 170 million dollars is allocated for defense purposes. This aid has permitted Viet-Nam to build up its armed strength and thus play an important role in Southeast Asia. If this aid should be cut both the military and economic progress would have to be reduced. This would cause serious repercussions not only <pb xml:id="pg_797" n="797" facs="0827"/>in Viet-Nam but among neighboring countries in Southeast Asia who look on Viet-Nam as an example of the good US aid can bring. Any cut would also bring serious political repercussions in Viet-Nam.</p>
<p>When asked about the possibility of devaluating the currency, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> replied that any devaluation would bring about serious military and economic problems unless production should be increased sufficiently to prevent inflation. He added that they are just beginning their industrial development and if they should devaluate now the results would be disastrous for the economy. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> reiterated that Viet-Nam is a pilot experiment in Southeast Asia which has made a strong impression on other countries in that area. He pointed out that in 1954 and 1955 the Indian Government did not believe that Free Viet-Nam could hold out against the Communists. Now, however, basically because of American aid, the situation has been stabilized and the Indians are now looking on Viet-Nam sympathetically.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Defense Plans</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> outlined his strategic defense plans emphasizing first of all the need for a highway system in the plateau area. He stated that such a plan had been devised by the French after the First World War but had never been implemented. This plan was devised in order to operate against an attack by way of Laos. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is convinced that the new highway system should be given high priority. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> stated that if the Communist attack comes, it will probably come by way of Laos which is the easiest route, through a sparsely populated area which constitutes an easy area for infiltration. In connection with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s general strategic concept and the request for additional force levels, President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> asked whether the Geneva Agreement prohibited such increase. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> replied that there are no limitations on the strength of the armed forces of either North or South Viet-Nam in the Geneva Agreement. Under the Agreement, however, additional war matériel could not be brought in but provision is made for the replacement of worn-out matériel. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> pointed out that the French have withdrawn a very large quantity of matériel so that it would be legally possible to replace this matériel with new equipment within the provisions of the Geneva Agreement. President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> asked whether, with the planned conscription there would also be a hard corps of professional soldiers and whether the officers and men are given sufficient pay to make a military career attractive. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> replied that about one-third of the future army forces would be professionals and the pay was high enough to be attractive.</p>
<p>President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> then reminded <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that his territory is protected by <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> agreed but believes he should have enough troops of his own to carry out his own defense. President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> <pb xml:id="pg_798" n="798" facs="0828"/>then asked <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> whether the proposed highways were primarily important from a purely military standpoint or whether they were also economically desirable. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> replied that the roads were important both from a military and economic point of view. The President, half jokingly, said that there was an old adage that roads sometimes were a “golden bridge for your enemies”. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> replied that this aspect had been given careful study and his experts are convinced that the roads are important for the defense of Viet-Nam because the present highway system is very vulnerable and inadequate. These roads in the high plateau area are not only militarily necessary but from an economic point of view they would permit the opening up of new farm land, allow these scarcely populated areas to be filled by people from the crowded coastal area and thus fill a vacuum in a vulnerable area which is now easily subject to infiltration. Regarding <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said that he has studied this question carefully and while <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> constitutes a good deterrent, there are only two countries which could possibly come immediately to the aid of Viet-Nam—Thailand and the Philippines. Pakistan is too far away. However, the Filipinos only have about 60 thousand troops and they would be needed to defend the Philippines and could not come to the aid of Viet-Nam. The Thais only have about 150 thousand men under arms and if an attack on Thailand should come by way of Laos these troops would be needed to defend Thailand itself. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> feels there is a strong possibility that given the revolutionary situation in Southeast Asia, the Vietminh might attack by commando methods which would be hard to stop unless Viet-Nam has a sufficiently large ground force. Such type of warfare would not lend itself to tactical atomic weapon defense and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> again questioned whether the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> plans which call for use of both tactical atomic weapons and air offensive would be effective in Viet-Nam where visibility is poor because of the overcast conditions throughout most of the year and the lack of any real concentrated targets for atomic weapons. Therefore, Viet-Nam must be in a position first of all to discourage an attack by having a large enough army. Secondly, if an attack should come, it would be possible with sufficient forces to hold out until <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> machinery can get into operation. For psychological as well as political reasons, it would be necessary for Viet-Nam to counter-attack as soon as possible. This must be done by Vietnamese troops and not foreign troops. While naval and air support would help to diminish enemy potential and permit naval landings in the North in a drive toward Hanoi, most of the military operations would have to be done by ground troops.</p>
<p>President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> stated that he, of course, understood the need for a strong army but the maintenance of a large army brings about serious political and economic problems. While the US wants <pb xml:id="pg_799" n="799" facs="0829"/>to do all it can to help its friends, it must be remembered that we have many international commitments which we must live up to and we have undertaken great obligations from Korea to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the volume of aid we can give is not limitless. For these reasons, we must use our best judgment in allocating the resources we can make available. Our problem is to do all we can to fight Communism as well as develop satisfactory solutions for many problems facing us and the free world. We must, therefore, study these problems from a global point of view and adopt the best programs for all concerned.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Devaluation</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> again brought up the question of the possible need to devaluate the Vietnamese currency by pointing out that the official rate is about 35 to the dollar and the Hong Kong black market rate is about 100 to the dollar. He wanted to know whether <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> planned for a devaluation. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> replied that this is a very serious and complex problem but he agreed to make a joint study of the matter.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Résumé</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> stated that he is convinced that all must be done to advance the successes which have already been attained in Viet-Nam and he hoped that assurances could be given that future aid would continue at the present level. President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> replied that he has not had an opportunity as yet to study the proposed distribution of aid for fiscal year 1958 and emphasized that the amount of aid for that year would depend upon what the Congress will do, but in any event, he promised <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to do the best we can once it is known how much money will be available.</p>

<p>The Secretary remarked that detailed discussion of military questions could take place during President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName>’s visit to the Pentagon on May 10.<note n="2" xml:id="d376fn2">See <ref target="#d379">Document 379</ref>.</note></p>
<p>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> said that Viet-Nam had made much progress in military matters and it was now a question of holding what had been gained. In order effectively to train the army it was necessary to entrust to the Civil Guard and the Village Defense Forces the task of internal security which had heretofore been handled by the army. Thus far the Civil Guard had been an auxiliary to the army in matters of internal security. It was not like similar forces in other countries because the Viet Minh were organizing commandos equipped with automatic weapons and the Civil Guard had to deal with these. These groups were being organized near the frontier and, according to French reports, they were especially strong in the region of Stung Treng in the wartime maquis region near the triangle formed by the frontiers of Laos, Cambodia and Viet-Nam. It appeared that Prince <persName corresp="#p_SN1">Sihanouk</persName> of Cambodia was unable to put a stop to such activities on the Cambodian side of the frontier.</p>
<p>The Secretary asked if we had information of overt acts by such forces, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> replied that there had been incursions across the frontier from Cambodia into Viet-Nam involving the capture of an airplane belonging to a rubber plantation and the robbery of plantation funds.</p>
<p>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> said it was no longer merely a question of infiltration across the 17th parallel or from Cambodia. There was now an airline service from Hanoi to Vientiane to Phnom Penh. Also, although he did not know just why the Vietnamese Communists had established air parcel post communications between Hanoi and Laos. Thus the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiComs</gloss> and the Vietnamese Communists could send personnel and materials to Cambodia by air and from Cambodia they could organize operations in Vietnamese territory. They were organizing commandos in the regions behind the French rubber plantations and they were in contact with remnants of the old dissident sect forces.</p>
<p>The Secretary asked what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName>’s response to these maneuvers was. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> replied that he was trying to <pb xml:id="pg_801" n="801" facs="0831"/>handle this business with the Civil Guard while training the army in divisional operations. As he had told the Secretary’s representative at Canberra he also wanted to construct a human wall in the depopulated area near the three frontiers. He was calling for people from Center Viet-Nam to fill the vacuum in the High Plateau region and in the Plaine des Joncs. This policy prompted a violent reaction from the Vietnamese Communist and <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> radios because it threatened their subversive plans. Two days before the attempt on the President’s life (February 22) at Banmethuot (in the High Plateau region) Radio Hanoi violently attacked the resettlement plan on the grounds that it represented establishment of bases for “American Aggression.” The Viet Minh saw the logical invasion route for attacking South Viet-Nam as following the Mekong and since Laos was defenseless and the Cambodian Army worth very little the danger to Viet-Nam was great. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> has discussed this strategic concept with <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> who concurs.</p>
<p>With conscription coming into effect (three months from May 2) <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> saw the prospect of demobilizing 40,000 men a year who could be settled as farmers in the depopulated regions in order to be sure they did not hang on as unemployed in the cities. The Australians and the British were interested in this plan. If Cambodia and Thailand were to do the same thing there would be considerable lessening of tensions. Replacement of these people by lower paid conscripts would help the budgetary problem. The Secretary asked if these settlers would not have to be paid as members of the Civil Defense Forces. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> said no. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> explained the President envisaged that these people would be settled as farmers but that being loyal persons with military training they could constitute a reserve force or human wall and could by their presence deny the Communists use of the area. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> said that for the same reason he emphasized construction of highways along the High Plateau connecting with Laos.</p>

<p>The Secretary asked President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> what he thought would happen in Laos. The President replied that the Lao were frightened and that the Prime Minister had admitted as much to him six months ago during a visit to Saigon.<note n="2" xml:id="d377fn2">Apparent reference to Souvanna Phouma’s September 8–9, 1956, official visit to Vietnam.</note> Unfortunately the Lao did not have many political leaders and competition was keen among the few they did have. The only strong man was <persName corresp="#p_KDS1">Katay</persName> the Vice Prime Minister. Phetsarath, now that he had returned,<note n="3" xml:id="d377fn3">After a long exile, Prince Petsarath had returned to Laos in 1957 with the title of Viceroy.</note> wanted to assume power and he had recently made some very neutralist statements. Furthermore Phetsarath had been soured, by many years of exile. Should Phetsarath assume power <persName corresp="#p_KDS1">Katay</persName> would feel threatened and that would be serious because <persName corresp="#p_KDS1">Katay</persName> has much army opinion and many civil servants on his side. <persName corresp="#p_KDS1">Katay</persName> had frankly informed the Vietnamese representative that should the people deliver themselves into the hands of the Pathet Lao, he, <persName corresp="#p_KDS1">Katay</persName>, would have to resort to a coup d’état and that he, <persName corresp="#p_KDS1">Katay</persName>, feared Communist Vietnamese intervention in such an eventuality. However <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> did not believe either the Vietnamese or the Chinese Communists would do anything because that would be an open act of aggression.</p>
<p>The Secretary said he believed that if there were such an open act of aggression we would not hesitate to intervene under the provisions of the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Treaty.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_KDS1">Katay</persName> was a proud man but had admitted nevertheless that the Lao had an inferiority complex vis-à-vis both the Vietnamese Communist and the Republic of Viet-Nam forces.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> asked how much influence Crown Prince Savang had. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> replied that the Prince had practically no influence, that he was honest but slow. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that Savang was anti-communist. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> agreed but said the Prince did not have much drive.</p>

<item>Chinese Minority Problem<note n="2" xml:id="d378fn2">The Chinese minority problem stemmed from the <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> government’s desire to reduce the control of the Chinese minority in Vietnam over the national economy and to force assimilation of overseas Chinese into the Vietnamese national culture. The Vietnamese Government promulgated decrees in August 1956 stating that henceforth and retroactively any child born in Vietnam of Chinese parents was Vietnamese and ordering all such Vietnamese citizens to take Vietnamese names and get Vietnamese identification cards. In September 1956, the Vietnamese Government outlawed participation by non-Vietnamese citizens in those middlemen trades in which the Chinese community predominated. Among the Chinese minority in South Vietnam there was little accommodation with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s policies and even some civil disturbances. The Republic of China repeatedly called upon the United States to use its good offices to prevail upon the Vietnamese Government to allow the overseas Chinese to retain their national character and pursue their livelihoods.

<p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary</p>
<list>
<item>The Secretary said he would like to discuss the Vietnamese Government’s Chinese policy which we thought rather hard. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said we were raising this question at the request of our Embassy in Taipei, that we were friends of both Viet-Nam and the Republic of China and that we were anxious that nothing be done to harm relations among nations of the Free World.</item>
<item>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> insisted that his Chinese policy was no cause for concern and that recent reports of disturbances in Saigon had been greatly exaggerated. In any event the prestige of Taipei was low among overseas Chinese and if the Chinese in Viet-Nam were non-Communist it was in response to the policy of the Government of Viet-Nam and not due to anything Taipei had done.</item>
</list>
<p>The Secretary said he would like to discuss the Vietnamese Government’s Chinese policy which we thought rather hard. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> replied that he thought his Chinese policy should not cause anxiety. Most of the Chinese in Viet-Nam wanted to comply with <pb xml:id="pg_804" n="804" facs="0834"/>the legislation. However, there were certain elements in the Chinese Legation in Saigon and in Formosa who were arousing the Chinese population. They called Chinese who wished to comply with Vietnamese regulations traitors and put them in a difficult position.</p>
<p>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> said he had just received a despatch from his government in Saigon explaining that the recent incidents were not as described in the Chinese press. The Chinese papers had confused the nationality question and the census question. First he would discuss the census question. He had started a census of foreigners because he had not known who among the population was French and who was not. That census ended two months ago. Then he started on the Chinese to find out how many of them there were. The Chinese population found this census normal and raised no objection. They went to their Legation to ask for certain certificates concerning their status. Certain ill-willed officials of the Chinese Legation delayed issuance of these certificates. The Chinese protested their loss of time. They were protesting against their own Legation. One stone was thrown breaking one window. That was all.</p>
<p>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> said that before the French had occupied Viet-Nam all Chinese there became Vietnamese citizens as a matter of course. There was no Chinese community. However, the French levied special head taxes on the Chinese and preferred to keep them separate for this purpose. The result was the creation of a state within a state in the Vietnamese capital with the Chinese enjoying a sort of economic dominance. The Bank of Indochina, for example, had dealt largely with Chinese middlemen who practiced usury in distributing credits. A good portion of the population of Viet-Nam is of Chinese origin, including two Cabinet members. The great great grandfather of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Tran Van Chuong</persName> was Chinese, for example. This case could be multiplied by millions.</p>
<p>The question of assimilation is not a difficult one, since the Chinese and the Vietnamese have a common culture as well as a racial affinity. Assimilation is the basis of the Vietnamese nationality law. Vietnamese literature is Chinese with a different pronunciation.</p>
<p>The Secretary asked if the Chinese were required to change their names. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> said no, they kept the same name with a different pronunciation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said he understood the Chinese had to take Vietnamese names. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> said they kept their own names but pronounced them in Vietnamese. The name Li, for example, became Le, pronounced <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName>. Nationalizing the Chinese merely followed the old rule of assimilation. Chinese born in Viet-Nam became Vietnamese citizens. The nationality decree affected only 1/6 or 1/7 of the total Chinese population since probably less than 100,000 of the approximately 600,000 Chinese in the country <pb xml:id="pg_805" n="805" facs="0835"/>could be proved to have been born there. So, they will have 500,000 Chinese left.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> asked how the bulk of the Chinese, the 500,000 not born in the country, would be able to make a living if they were banned from the 11 key occupations by the decree of that subject. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> replied that among these Chinese there were some very rich men, millionaires, who had profited from the war and from the post-war period by accumulating French surplus goods. He was asking these rich Chinese to invest their profits in new industries. He felt that those Chinese who had no money could find employment in these new industries. As far as the eleven restricted occupations were concerned, the Vietnamese were only doing what the Filipinos and Cambodians had already done and were in fact less strict about this matter than other countries. Furthermore, this restriction applied to all foreigners and not just to Chinese. It pertained to occupations which would permit usury and speculation and to small business in the interior. But the Chinese were concentrated chiefly in Saigon and they were the principal importers who profited by U.S. aid.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> asked if most of the Chinese in Viet-Nam sympathized with the Republic of China or with the Communists. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> replied that they were opportunists who would follow which ever side was stronger. The Chinese in Viet-Nam were anti-Communist or non-Communist only because the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> was anti-Communist. Viet-Nam was the only place in Southeast Asia where the Chinese population was not pro-Communist. This was not the case in Cambodia, Thailand, or Malaya. Chinese friends like Bishop Yu Pin who wanted to carry on anti-Communist movements found in Saigon the only favorable political climate for such operations. “Free Pacific”, the principal anti-Communist magazine now being distributed in other countries, was published in Saigon. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> suggested that Bangkok being at the “hinge” between the countries under Indian influence and the countries under Chinese influence might be a more appropriate site but its sponsors felt Bangkok was not suitable.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said we had raised the question at the request of our Embassy in Taipei, that we were friends of both Viet-Nam and the Republic of China and that we were anxious that nothing be done to harm relations among nations of the free world. We knew that the Chinese minority was a problem in every Southeast Asian country and we hoped nothing would be done to cause them to jump over on to the Communist side.</p>
<p>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said that Taipei’s view was not very realistic and that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had in fact very little influence on overseas Chinese. If the Chinese in Saigon were anti-Communist or non-Communist it was because of the policy of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to which the Chinese subscribed <pb xml:id="pg_806" n="806" facs="0836"/>and not to anything Taipei had done. He felt that the Foreign Minister in Taipei understood the situation better than did his Legation in Saigon. However, there was an Overseas Chinese Office in Taipei which wanted to keep these wealthy Chinese as “gravy”. Before the arrival of the present Chinese Minister in Saigon there was a Chargé d’Affaires who was motivated by ill-will. This fellow was now in Formosa and still stirring up trouble. If Viet-Nam were to go neutralist the Chinese there as in Cambodia would hang out flags for Mao Tse Tung. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had learned in confidence from certain wealthy Chinese that they would like to become Vietnamese citizens but they feared the propaganda of the Chinese Legation which called them traitors. In order to comply with the regulations many of them told their wives to register as Vietnamese citizens. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> had signed a great many naturalization decrees for Chinese not affected by the nationality decree. A few weeks ago 2,000 Chinese born outside Viet-Nam and not affected by the nationality decree requested naturalization. Little by little this matter will work itself out. Refugees from the north who are very resourceful will replace the Chinese in the eleven occupations gradually.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said we would advise Minister Yeh who was very uneasy about the Chinese minority problem to consult President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName>. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> said that more than 2,000 Chinese refugees had fled from the north to Free Viet-Nam after the Geneva armistice because they could not do business in the Communist Zone. He had welcomed them for humanitarian reasons although he might well have told them to go to Taipei. Indian and French businessmen had also fled south for the same reason.</p>
<p>The Secretary left the meeting after arranging to meet President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> the next day at 3:30 p.m. to continue the conversation.<note n="3" xml:id="d378fn3"><p>See <ref target="#d381">Document 381</ref>.</p>
<p>There was a second memorandum of conversation, also by <persName corresp="#p_CTJ1">Corcoran</persName>, May 9, on the Chinese minority question which covered similar although not identical ground. Other than <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, who did not participate in this second conversation, the list of participants is identical to that above.

<p>Secretary Quarles opened the meeting by explaining that instead of a briefing for President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> as had originally been scheduled, it was felt that this might be considered presumptuous in view of the President’s knowledge of Southeast Asia, and therefore the President was invited to express his views on the situation.</p>
<p>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> proceeded to sketch out his thoughts on the strategic problem of Viet-Nam, the military situation and its requirements. He views Viet-Nam as a bridgehead, which in case of conflict would receive support and assistance from <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. Viet-Nam is endangered by two things: subversive elements under Communist direction and aggression by invasion. This latter may take the form of invasion at the 17th parallel, or over the high plateau and then down through Laos to cut off the capital from the west, or a combination of both. The invasion route across the 17th parallel would cut off a large percentage of the population and not enough would be left to raise additional forces for resistance. The interior line of invasion along the border area has no natural defenses after the enemy passes through the Annam Chain. This is a soft area for defensive purposes. Either one, or a combination of both, of the above routes is possible and feasible. Above the 17th parallel the Viet Minh have 200,000 regular troops and 250,000 regional troops. Secretary Quarles raised the question as to restriction on those forces by the Geneva Accords. It was stated that there is no restriction on the numbers. The troops, however, have been given modernized equipment and training by the Chinese Communists and their re-equipment is a violation of the <pb xml:id="pg_808" n="808" facs="0838"/>Geneva Accords. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> also stated the Russians are particularly concerned with the training of these forces and in accordance with Russian practice have emphasized artillery to the point that they have three times as much as Viet-Nam. He stated that the Viet-Minh air force has been training in Communist China since 1951.</p>
<p>The Vietnamese do not have sufficient forces to guard the entire border. Laos has a weak army, very poor roads and is lightly populated. Infiltration through Laos is both easy and dangerous to Viet-Nam. It is believed possible that the Viet Minh could infiltrate this interior route with as many as 100,000 troops disguised as coolies which could be very dangerous. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> views a strictly defensive plan as unsatisfactory if only because of the demoralizing factor. He feels the plan must be both offensive and defensive. He covered this concept as follows: (1) Vietnamese do not know the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Plan. (2) The General Staff first conceived a defensive plan which was considered demoralizing. (3) They have now conceived art offensive-defensive plan which has been referred to <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName>. (4) Population of the North is against Communism. If free to move it would move out to the South. In the North soldiers are the principals in the privileged class. (5) It is believed necessary in the event of aggression to bring airborne troops into the high plateau area of Laos–Viet-Nam, and also conduct airborne operations to pin down the Viet Minh and make possible an offensive to the North. In addition the line of the 17th parallel must be held as this is the route of refugees. Any airborne landings must be Vietnamese troops not foreign troops. Foreign troops should be limited to use below the 17th parallel as support forces.</p>
<p>Big question for Vietnamese is when do they get the foreign troops. Thai forces will be otherwise occupied. The civil guard is poorly equipped and would not be effective. There are no other ground forces available in the Southeast Asia area. In answer to a question as to whether the troops to be used in the plateau could be Thai, the President answered no. Laos is afraid of the Thais; they are afraid of a Pan-Thai movement to swallow Laos. Laos hates Cambodia, distrusts the Thais but likes the Vietnamese. They would like an outlet to the sea at Tourane. They have promised to send officers to be trained by the Vietnamese. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> then commented on his planned second counter move which is to fill up the vacuum of the high plateau area, the forest border area and the Plaine des Joncs. This plan will be begun by placing trained demobilized men from the Civil Guard in these areas with their families, 3,000 so far. He is now appealing to the people of the central Viet-Nam area to settle on the high plateau and is asking people of South Viet-Nam, the southern areas, to move into the Plaine des Joncs.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_809" n="809" facs="0839"/>
<p><gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> has always recognized the need of the fight against subversion. Planting men in these areas will construct a human wall effective against Communist infiltration and subversion. The above goes hand in hand with construction of roads in the above areas. Stationing men and building roads serve both a strategic and economic purpose. The road building projects is [<hi rend="italic">are</hi>] really a stage of the French plan that goes back to 1919 and continues to 1942.</p>
<p>Secretary Quarles asked the status of the road construction now. The President answered it had not yet begun but Capital Engineering Firm was starting construction studies and he thought construction could begin next year. These roads in the interior are important because the road along the coast is easily disrupted. It has many bridges and that is why French, thinking of the possibility of Japanese aggression along the coast, thought roads in this area desirable. This was part of the French Empire Plan to tie together Viet-Nam, Cambodia and Laos. It is still a good plan for the defense of South-east Asia. It includes a road across the interior to Pakse on the Mekong which is near the Thai Railroad terminus at Ubon. Route 9 from Tourane to Savannakhet is too close to the 17th parallel, but Laos is interested in an outlet to the sea for economic reasons. <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> principles are (1) to parry aggression (2) struggle against subversion and (3) economic and social aspects required to support the above. The French and British are interested mostly in number 3. The military strategic aspects of offensive-defensive plan are favored by the air force and navy. In case of aggression tactical atomic weapons could be used. Vietnamese feel they must emphasize ground weapons because the Viet-Nam war showed that it was difficult to use air effectively in this country. Communist troops are very mobile. The irregular forces advance ahead of regular troops to sabotage and cut communications. They also follow the regular troops to subdue the population. Use of atomic weapons against the aggression through the sparsely settled territory of Laos would not be effective. Therefore, the President believes that the Vietnamese must reorganize their Army to be prepared for such a struggle.</p>
<p>Despite the efforts of <persName corresp="#p_OD1">General O’Daniel</persName> the present Army structure is now not satisfactory. This is due to the French policy which insisted on keeping Vietnamese forces in small units no larger than a battalion, preventing the development of a proper Viet-Nam Army. This is why <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could not come to power sooner. French said Vietnamese couldn’t be trained and were too weak physically. They limited them to light forces. After the Armistice the French continued to control the forces. Following the French phase out, and the elimination of French forces, training was conducted under a mixed French-US training group. The French concept of light battalion, light division, heavy division, made no sense at all not even for use against <pb xml:id="pg_810" n="810" facs="0840"/>the sects. I [i.e.. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>] therefore felt the Army should be completely reorganized, and consolidation of training into a strictly US mission made this possible. The US military know that the Vietnamese make good soldiers. I have talked over my idea with <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName>, and it is to reorganize my 6 light and 4 heavy divisions of 5,600 and 8,300 men respectively, into the same number of field divisions with 10,000 each, with 3 regiments per division. To achieve this the Army must increase to 170,000. This would avoid a complete shift of the present division. If we stay at the present 150,000 men it would be necessary to shift or change the basic structure. If our total forces are raised to 170 thousand we could increase each division to 10,000. To reduce the impact on the budget I have decreed a draft as a stop gap plan. Draftees will be inducted for 1 year terms in the age group 20 to 21. Beginning 1 August 150 per day will be inducted. This will amount to 48,000 per year. In 3 years this will make it possible to replace 2/3 of the Army at the end of 3 years. The budget will be stabilized. At the present time Viet-Nam Army is organized along French colonial lines with the families traveling with the troops. The average pay is a thousand piasters a month. The military budget is 170 million dollars a year. The use of draftees would reduce the cost by half. Draftees would be young people with no families. The U.S. military recommend that I not replace all my troops with draftees but retain 30,000 minimum as a hard core. I believe the above is necessary because in my view to meet aggression in my country requires emphasis on the ground forces. As the present troops with their families are demobilized they would be settled in the high plateau and the Plaine des Joncs area. This would be beneficial both from [<hi rend="italic">for?</hi>] economic and strategic reasons.</p>
<p>At this point Secretary Quarles noted that the President was due at the Press Club shortly and requested time for a few U.S. questions. His first was whether the Geneva Accords inhibited [<hi rend="italic">prohibited?</hi>] (US) training personnel. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> replied that there had been no protests—there had been embarrassing questions, but the Geneva Accords only prohibited troop reinforcements.</p>
<p>Mr. Quarles asked a general question on the status of training and equipment of the Viet-Nam air force. General <persName corresp="#p_TVD2">Don</persName> replied that the planes turned over by the French had been retained for training until no longer usable and then returned. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> said that in general vehicles and communications equipment were in bad shape. These can be replaced with the same type used by the French without violating the Geneva Accords. He continued to say that the French training of the air force and navy in his opinion was very poor because the French were dragging their feet. For the Viet-Nam Air Force actually they were providing only 6 months training for mechanics which U.S. military personnel considered inadequate. <pb xml:id="pg_811" n="811" facs="0841"/>When the French questioned him about the renewal of their training contract the conversation resulted in an agreement to withdraw the French Air Force training mission with the exception of special French personnel who would remain until the end of the year for technical training. All other requirements would be met by the U.S. He had therefore requested the [<hi rend="italic">that</hi>] <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> provide these training personnel and several instructors for the military academy (Armed Forces Academy).</p>
<p>After brief closing remark by Secretary Quarles the session ended.</p>

<p>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> said that the Cambodians had seen that things were going well in Viet-Nam so that they were now beginning to imitate the Vietnamese in many ways. However, they were still very much under French influence because they did not have people capable of doing government administrative work such as the drafting of documents, etc., and had to depend on French counsel. These French counselors usually steered clear of economic questions and in these matters the Cambodians were trying to follow the Vietnamese example.</p>
<p>The Cambodians have been started toward neutralism by the Indian representative there. It was fashionable to be neutralist and <persName corresp="#p_SN1">Sihanouk</persName> thought that by following such a policy he could become a <pb xml:id="pg_812" n="812" facs="0842"/>’big shot’ and the Indians encouraged him. The French in Cambodia also encouraged him shortsightedly in their desire to prevent the spread of American influence from Viet-Nam to Cambodia.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said we had recent indications that <persName corresp="#p_SN1">Sihanouk</persName> was somewhat disturbed at communist activities. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> agreed and said <persName corresp="#p_SN1">Sihanouk</persName> did not have control of his frontiers. The head-quarters of communist subversive activities had moved from Hanoi to Phnom Penh and the Soviet Embassy and the Chinese communist economic mission were counting on making use of the 300,000 Chinese in Cambodia for subversive activities, particularly across the frontier into Viet-Nam. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> remarked that one of the leading papers in Phnom Penh had four out of six pages denouncing communist aid as “paper” and calling American aid real aid. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> said that the establishment of postal communications between Hanoi and Cambodia meant that communist infiltration of that country had been stepped up from a trickle to an avalanche.</p>

<p>The Secretary asked if there were any questions apart from the joint communiqué<note n="2" xml:id="d381fn2">For the text of the joint communiqué, see the Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, May 27, 1957, pp. 851–852. The address <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> made before the Joint Session of Congress, May 9, is also printed <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> pp. 852–854.</note> which the President would care to discuss. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName> <pb xml:id="pg_813" n="813" facs="0843"/>said that earlier in the day he had reviewed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> all of the points which President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> had covered in his previous talk with the Secretary.<note n="3" xml:id="d381fn3">See <ref target="#d376">Documents 376</ref>, <ref target="#d377">377</ref>, and <ref target="#d378">378</ref>.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName> then recapitulated these various points, placing great stress on the need for tractors in connection with the resettlement projects in the high plateau. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> discussed at length the superiority of tractors over water buffalos in this area.</p>
<p>The Secretary asked how many rice crops per year were harvested in South Viet-Nam. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> replied that in the south there was only one crop a year and that this meant that families were fully and profitably occupied for only one and a half to two months per year. Furthermore, dependence on a one crop economy, which meant that rice had to be exported at a low price in international competition, made the country very vulnerable to economic depression. Therefore, it was necessary to work as quickly and cheaply as possible, not only to produce sufficient rice for export, but also to supply the needs of the people in the high plateau. As a means of profitably using the people’s time during the large part of the year when they were not engaged in rice production there were many resources, particularly in the high plateau, such as rubber, tea, coffee, vegetables, fruits, cane, bamboo, and wood for handicraft purposes which could be exploited. It was necessary that Viet-Nam develop handicraft production in both the plains and the high plateau, since cultivation of the rice crop did not suffice to maintain full employment. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> further discussed both the scarcity of water buffalo and their unsuitability for employment in the high plateau in comparison with bulldozers and tractors. He stressed that in view of the approach of the rainy season he was very anxious to begin work on the resettlement projects and that this work depended largely on provision of tractors and bulldozers.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>, said that on May 6 after the President’s departure from Saigon on his visit the Government of Viet-Nam had been informed of <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>/Washington’s approval of the resettlement project and that he understood that orders were now being placed for equipment. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> reiterated the importance he attached to the provision of mechanical equipment for this project, stressing that it was tractors which had made possible “miracle Cai San”, where 40,000 refugees and 10,000 local inhabitants had been resettled. This project had become a pilgrimage for newspapermen and statesmen of other countries. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> felt that tractors and bulldozers were as important to Viet-Nam now as tanks were during an offensive in time of war. People had already started moving to the high plateau. Half the total number involved were already there and half were on <pb xml:id="pg_814" n="814" facs="0844"/>the way. Without tractors and bulldozers they had to depend on hand choppers to clear the land. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that we understood that the President wished us to expedite the shipment of mechanical equipment for the resettlement project, that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName> had already explained this matter to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> in the morning and that we would work on it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName> said that apart from the general agricultural problems already discussed Viet-Nam had aid problems of an industrial nature. The Government of Viet-Nam on the one hand, and the <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>/Washington on the other, were not in full agreement on the manner in which to use American aid. The Vietnamese idea was to use United States equipment for industries that would be mixed enterprises, with both private and state participation and there was some reluctance on the part of American experts to approve enterprises involving state participation in industry.</p>
<p>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> said the Vietnamese had thought this over very carefully and they hoped that an exception could be made permitting some government participation in a few enterprises as a catalyst to stimulate private participation. He said that French capital was still important in Viet-Nam and that the French capitalists would like to see state participation in enterprises in which they were to invest. Vietnamese investors also favored state participation. Also there was the fact that private investment was not attracted to such essential industries as sugar production. The government’s aim was not to promote state ownership but merely to encourage private investment. Once private industries had gotten under way the government’s shares would be sold to private owners.</p>
<p>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> next discussed the question of direct aid at great length indicating that the Vietnamese would prefer less commercial aid and more direct aid which they could use for acquiring capital goods. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> pointed out the need for commercial imports in order to generate counterpart local currencies for military expenses. The Secretary suggested that these matters could be discussed in detail with representatives of <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that the Director of Planning, Mr. Huynh Van Diem, and the American Aid Administrator, Mr. Vu Van Thai, had already discussed these matters with officers of the Department and with <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss><note n="4" xml:id="d381fn4">These discussions took place at a series of meetings on May 6 and 7 prior to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s arrival in Washington. Those participating in the meetings were Vu Van Thai and Huynh Van Diem for South Vietnam and a U.S. interagency group made up of <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Price</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_CTJ1">Corcoran</persName> for the Department of State and Paul Summers, Deputy Regional Director for Far East, and Frederick Bunting, Chief, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam Division, for <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>.

It was necessary to strengthen the country from the inside by giving it means of production. As long as the Vietnamese could not produce goods from raw materials they would be dependent on American aid and this they did not want. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said that the Vietnamese lived at a faster rate than the Thai or the Cambodians, for example, and that their consumption needs were more similar to the Japanese. Therefore they had to produce enough to meet these needs.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> said that an industrial development center was included in next year’s proposed aid budget. The Secretary asked what sort of industry was envisaged. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> replied that sugar, glass, cement, and textile production were being considered. The Secretary asked if Viet-Nam had to import cotton for its textile industry. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> replied that this raised the question of triangular currencies and said that the Vietnamese did not want soft French money; they wanted dollars. If they got aid in francs they lost about one-third of its value. The Suez crisis had raised insurance and other costs by 22% and the francs had depreciated in value by 6 to 8%, while the cost of material products in francs had gone up by 6%. The French, instead of paying the United States in dollars for agricultural surpluses, were paying in francs and thus dumping their soft currency into the Vietnamese aid program.</p>
<p>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> next referred to a note<note n="6" xml:id="d381fn6">Not found in Department of State files.</note> he had received from the American Embassy in Saigon concerning possible devaluation of the piaster and said that the very possibility of devaluation would create a panic in Viet-Nam. Devaluation was possible only for a country with a very high level of production. Devaluation would have an effect, not only on the price of goods, but on the Vietnamese standard of living, since salaries and the prices of locally-produced articles would both be affected and that the prices of imported products, on which the Vietnamese standard of living depended, would be increased considerably.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that the question of devaluation was not a device to reduce aid and that we merely wished to get the best out of the aid program. No one in Washington at the policy level recommended the type of cut in aid envisaged in the Clement Johnson <pb xml:id="pg_816" n="816" facs="0846"/>report.<note n="7" xml:id="d381fn7">Apparent reference to a study prepared under the auspices of the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Problems On the problem of overvalued currencies in the Indochinese states, Korea, and Turkey. More information is in Department of State, <hi rend="italic">Current Economic Developments</hi>, No. 522, June 25, 1957, pp. 1–4.</note> Since the whole question of devaluation was so complicated the Vietnamese and American economists should sit down and talk it over. It was important that this matter be looked into soon. We understood President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName>’s concern but an examination of the question of devaluation could not be avoided. If American aid was going into the Vietnamese economy at the rate of 35 piasters to one dollar and the real rate of exchange was perhaps twice that there had to be some determination of what was happening to the difference. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName> said that this difference was responsible for the improved Vietnamese standard of living. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName> asked whether the problem should be studied in Washington or Saigon. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> suggested that it be studied in Saigon. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> suggested that it be studied in Washington. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> suggested that talks could commence while the President’s party was still in the United States and it was agreed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName> and Messrs.

<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that we were interested in Laos, as were the Vietnamese, and wondered how President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> thought Viet-Nam could aid in stabilizing Laos. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> replied that if things went well in Viet-Nam and if the high plateau resettlement project was carried out things would go well in Laos. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> suggested that Viet-Nam–Laos coordination of frontier control, opening the road from Tourane to the Lao frontier and increased training of Lao personnel for expediting the transshipment of goods through Viet-Nam to Laos would all be useful. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> said that Souvanna Phouma had brought these questions up last year and that the Government of Viet-Nam was ready to do anything it could to help Laos. The Vietnamese had taken a number of young Lao visitors through their ministries to show them how they operated. These visits had been arranged at the suggestion of an American officer, Captain Rufus Philipps.<note n="2" xml:id="d382fn2">A former member of <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName>’s staff in Vietnam.</note> Viet-Nam’s relations with Laos were cordial and there was mutual sympathy between the two governments.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> asked if the Vietnamese were in a position to give the Lao advice in handling Viet Minh infiltration. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo</persName> said they would have to go slow in this matter which would depend on the Lao Government. The Lao army and civil servants would ask nothing better. However, the Lao heads of government had a strange complex due to French influence. This influence was not good. Whereas the staff of the French Embassy in Saigon was composed of career Foreign Office personnel the French representation in Laos and Cambodia was made up of old colonial service officers, the same ones who had lost the war in Indochina. Ambassador Payart in Saigon was annoyed at this state of affairs, since the old colonialists in Laos and Cambodia were not coordinating their policy with him. In trying to find jobs for old colonial administrators who could not be absorbed in what was left of the French Empire they had dumped a particularly poor one into Vientiane as Counselor of the Lao Government. This man also happened to be the son-in-law of Prince Phetsarath. It must be remembered that the French are extremely chauvinistic and that they detested American influence. In order to prevent the spread of American influence into Laos and Cambodia they had shortsightedly encouraged neutralism. The country most annoyed by this state of affairs was Australia. The Australians were very sensitive about anything which threatened the security of Southeast Asia.</p>

<p rend="center">THE PROSPECTS FOR NORTH VIETNAM<note n="2" xml:id="d383fn2">According to a note on the cover sheet, the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, the intelligence organizations of the Department of State, the Army, Navy, Air Force, and the Joint Staff participated in the preparation of this estimate. All members of the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> concurred in this estimate on May 14, with the exception of the representatives of the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> who abstained, the subject being outside their jurisdiction.</note></p>
<p rend="center">The Problem</p>
<p>To analyze the current political, economic, and military situations and to estimate the prospects for North Vietnam over the next year or so.</p>
<p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
<p>1. Although the Communist regime in North Vietnam (<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>) has probably lost a considerable measure of its original popular support and has been faced with sporadic outbursts of violence, it remains in firm control largely because of the loyalty and effectiveness of the army. Moreover, with substantial help from the Bloc, it has apparently made significant progress toward economic restoration, particularly in agriculture. (Paras. 13–16, 20–21)</p>
<p>2. The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> has undertaken to “correct its mistakes” which it admits caused popular resentment, and it will probably be able to regain some of the popular support which it lost. If the party organization is sufficiently strengthened and if crop prospects are good, steps toward further socialization of agriculture may come as soon as the fall or winter of 1957. Local disturbances may recur but for the foreseeable future the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> will be capable of maintaining effective control. (Paras. 17, 23–26)</p>
<p>3. The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> is generally isolated from the outside world except for close ties with the Bloc, on which it depends for aid and support. However, the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> has probably been disappointed by the lack of effective Bloc support for its objective of unifying all Vietnam under <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> rule. The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, with Bloc logistical support, could easily over-run South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos if opposed only by indigenous forces. However, the Bloc would support such an attack only if Moscow and Peiping were to estimate that such action carried little risk of US military intervention. (Paras. 29–34)</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_819" n="819" facs="0849"/>
<p>4. The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> will probably continue its tactics of “peaceful competition” with South Vietnam for the support of the Vietnamese, although it will continue its efforts to infiltrate and to subvert official and nonofficial organizations and to exploit dissident and dissatisfied groups in South Vietnam. In Laos, we believe that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> will continue to support Pathet Lao efforts to negotiate a political agreement with the Royal Lao Government, with the ultimate objective of Communist control, and may encourage local Pathet Lao military action in order to bring pressure to this end. The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> will probably not, in the immediate future, play a primary role in Cambodia. (Paras. 34–36)</p>

<item>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Elbridge Durbrow</persName></item>
</list>
<p>The following are highlights of a long conversation I had on the flight to Los Angeles with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Tran Van Chuong</persName> in which President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> participated except for the beginning of discussion. It is perhaps worthwhile to point out how discussion arose. In going over the Los Angeles speech <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName> was preparing for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName> included a statement to the effect that the communists were not deterred or much worried about American possession of A and H bombs. When I disagreed with this statement <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName> outlined at length his basic concepts of any future military operations which might take place in Vietnam. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> did not listen to the first part of the discussion, but listened without saying much during the bulk of the discussion.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName>’s thesis is that he feared that Vietnam could not count upon the United States to come to its aid militarily under certain circumstances despite U.S. and <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> commitments. He added that he is convinced that we would not use tactical or other nuclear weapons in the event we did come to their aid. He cited our refusal to use A <pb xml:id="pg_821" n="821" facs="0851"/>bombs in Korea and our failure to enter the war in Indo-China with or without the use of A bombs before and after Dien Bien Phu. <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName> added that in conversations with other Asian colleagues in Washington most of them share his fears that the United States probably would not come to the aid of any individual country in case of hostilities unless it were in direct United States interest to do so. <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName> claims this is the reason why many Asian countries have turned to neutralism. He is also quite doubtful whether <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> would, in all circumstances, come to aid of Vietnam if hostilities should break out. <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName> was very emphatic in saying that he and most of his Asian colleagues in Washington agree that the West lost a great deal of prestige in Asia by the Korean stalemate and the French collapse in Indo-China.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName> then outlined in detail the strong temptations facing all Asian countries to embrace neutralism. He argued that most of these countries reasoned that if they did not have to maintain large military forces they could balance their budgets and might, by their neutral attitude, be spared in any future war. He added that such temptations might also appeal to the people of Vietnam, although he gave assurances that Vietnam is different and realized that despite the heavy cost they must maintain as large an Army as they feel necessary to defend themselves and counter attack against any communist thrust. That is why President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> wants to raise his force goal to 170,000 men.</p>
<p>When <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName> reiterated he did not believe the U.S. would use tactical A weapons in a local war in Vietnam, President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> disagreed by stating he could envisage certain situations in which U.S. would use tactical A weapons. The President did not agree with <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName>’s contention that a perpetual nuclear stalemate has been reached between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the U.S. The President believes the U.S. must keep on developing better nuclear weapons in order to keep ahead of the Soviets. If we did not the Soviets might develop a truly overpowering weapon which they might use to conquer the world provided they were certain the U.S. did not have as good a weapon with which to retaliate. Both agreed, however, that it would be most disastrous to use A weapons on Hanoi or other civilian concentrations, because the Vietnamese Government counted on the population in the North to rise up against the communists in the case of hostilities which would make it counter-productive to use A bombs on any populated areas. Both reiterated that they did not believe that American Air or Naval support could be effective in Vietnam, because of the prevalence of heavy cloud cover over most of country throughout the year.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName> stated that although <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Admiral Stump</persName> and other American Commanders had given assurances that we would come to the <pb xml:id="pg_822" n="822" facs="0852"/>aid of Vietnam in case of difficulty, and he knew that they were most sincere in making these statements, he feared that they would not be permitted, by overall considerations, to carry out these commitments in all circumstances. I reminded him that in the last few weeks the world had seen a very forceful example which should convince everybody that we would come to the assistance of small nations under communist attack. I then referred to the movement of the Sixth Fleet with a reinforced Marine Division to the Eastern Mediterranean in the recent Jordan crisis.<note n="2" xml:id="d385fn2">After an internal crisis developed in Jordan in April 1957, the United States sent units of the Sixth Fleet to rhe Eastern Mediterranean.</note> <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> both agreed that this forceful action did, in fact, indicate that we apparently intended to carry out our commitments.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Comments:</p>
<p>The reason I have reported these remarks in some detail is that it is the first time that I have heard Vietnamese, and in this case <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> by his silence apparently concurring, openly question whether we would carry out our commitments. I reported this conversation to <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Admiral Stump</persName> before he talked with President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> about the situation in Vietnam.</p>

<item>Summary of Talk Between <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Admiral Stump</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> at Honolulu.</item>
</list>
<p>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> outlined again in some detail his strategic concept to justify the need to increase the Vietnamese forces by 20,000 additional men. Prior to this talk I had informed <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Admiral Stump</persName> of the conversation I had had with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName>, with President <pb xml:id="pg_823" n="823" facs="0853"/><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> participating,<note n="2" xml:id="d386fn2">See <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> in which the Ambassador had indicated, among other things, that he was afraid the United States could not, in all circumstances, live up to the commitments given to Vietnam to come to its assistance in case of hostilities, as well as the Ambassador’s conviction that, as in Korea, we would not use A-weapons in the event we should come to Vietnam’s assistance.</p>
<p>After <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had finished explaining his strategic concept. <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Admiral Stump</persName>, without giving any indication that he had been filled in on Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName>’s ideas, informed <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> along the following lines:</p>
<p>The <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Admiral</persName> stated that President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had declared on several occasions that in case the communists should open hostilities against any free-world country, the United States would use all means at its disposal to stop them, including the use of tactical A-weapons as well as other nuclear weapons if necessary. The <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Admiral</persName> added that we would not in any case hold back as we had in Korea. He added that we would not use nuclear weapons against concentrated civilian centers and that, if we were unable to stop the communists in Vietnam or nearby territories in connection with any hostilities, we would not hesitate to use all weapons at our disposal on such areas as the Canton military complex in order to bring about the defeat of the communists. The <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Admiral</persName> assured his listeners that the United States now has military capabilities which can stop and defeat any communist military thrust. The <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Admiral</persName> added that <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> powers would also help in such circumstances. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> again questioned whether the Asian <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> powers could be very effective in assisting Vietnam in connection with any communist attack. He reiterated without indicating that he wished to be informed about them that the Vietnamese Government was not cognizant of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> military plans.</p>
<p>After the meeting in <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Admiral Stump</persName>’s office while we were on the way to a military review. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName> asked the <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Admiral</persName> whether he personally believed that the Vietnamese army should be increased by 20,000 men as <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has requested. The <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Admiral</persName> replied that this matter would have to be studied but that he personally thought <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s request had merit, but added that before any decisions could be taken it would be necessary to know how much money the United States Congress would appropriate for various aid purposes. The <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Admiral</persName> stated he was sure that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName> were well aware of the present economy drive in the Congress affecting all matters of aid.</p>

<p>4. <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 3698.<note n="2" xml:id="d388fn2">In this telegram, June 19, the Embassy indicated that reports of <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>’s pessimism and criticism of South Vietnam’s economic and Chinese policies were confirmed in less extreme terms by discussions with <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> himself. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.11/6–1957)</note></p>
<p>1. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>’s current pessimism . . . believed to stem in part from his exposure for first time to wider range problems mostly in economic field during absence President in U.S. While we have no reason believe <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> shares this pessimism, <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>’s thinking also reflects certain underlying attitudes of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> leadership arising from combination of factors and sharpened by psychological let-down following <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s trip to U.S. which, while personal triumph, did not bring any dramatic promises or moves that would appeal to popular imagination as new drive forward.</p>
<p>2. After successful political consolidation of past three years <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is now entering period where it hopes build up, largely through economic means, a South East Asian “show case” that will far out-shine <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. With this objective in view regime may be frustrated by realization that, despite success of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s American tour, same old problems have to be faced and normal U.S. aid procedures (e.g., planning, study, justification, etc.) followed. There is also realization, recently voiced pointedly by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s brother <persName corresp="#p_NDL1">Luyen</persName>, that <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> is woefully lacking in trained administrative talent needed to reach its objectives. This problem is accentuated by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s unwillingness to delegate authority and the high standard of personal loyalty required of his subordinates, a criterion which limits group from which able persons can be recruited.</p>
<p>3. An additional complication is that since attempt on his life last February <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has become more than ever obsessed with security so that this factor has tended to dominate his thinking and color his attitude toward all problems. (Examples: the highland settlements, road priorities, fear of Trojan horse in large French business enterprises.)</p>
<p>4. Despite indications of frustration in <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s immediate entourage, there is little reason to believe there is a widespread “malaise.” Certainly the country is at work and much progress is obvious. <pb xml:id="pg_826" n="826" facs="0856"/>Goods are in plentiful supply, prices are stable and the rice crop is good. True, credit is tight but this in itself is not unhealthy condition and can be changed when situation warrants. Our economic and military advisors in the field all bring reports of progress and stability. Furthermore, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has relaxed somewhat his adamant attitude re French businesses by agreeing to BGI starting glass factory, etc.</p>
<p>5. Even so, the semblance of a state of “malaise” has been enhanced by increasing crop of rumors which according <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> are put out by Phan Quang Dan (opposition leader), bitter French colonialists and French military, Chinese and Vietminh. Additional disgruntlement has been caused by increased taxes and tightening money market due to various factors, i.e. uncertainty Chinese community coupled with deliberate Chinese hold back, tie up of money through higher tax receipts pumped into slow-moving <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> financial system and over-importation certain goods past few months.</p>
<p>6. Present period is one of transition and indecision as to what kind of economic program to adopt and how get this economic program under way. To whip up drive and enthusiasm some new conspicuous achievements are needed such as actual beginning of programs under Five-Year Plan coupled with announcement road-building in plateau area, new industries being started, settlement Chinese problem. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> obviously conscious this need but seems somewhat undecided how best add new drive to regime. This feeling of frustration, perhaps more than anything else, is believed to be responsible for the pessimism reflected in <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>’s conversation.</p>
<p>7. Pessimism, frustrations and indecisions felt in varying degrees by <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> leaders stem basically from long-term problems that cannot be resolved quickly or easily. These problems are essentially those found in all underdeveloped countries that seek progress. We shall have to live with them and the psychological reactions they engender.</p>

<p>In reply to the question you raised at a recent <gloss target="#t_G1">G</gloss> staff meeting we are submitting the following information from the <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> mission.</p>
<p>You will recall that <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> was established in Saigon, Viet-Nam in June 1956 to recover and to ship out reparable <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> material excess to Indochina needs, to improve the logistical capability of the Vietnamese armed forces, and to dispose of salvage and scrap returned to U.S. control. The taking over by <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> of what was in substance the logistical function of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> released <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>’s strength of 342 for training activities and provided through <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> 350 military personnel for logistics.</p>
<p>The International Control Commission (<gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>), established by the Geneva Accords and consisting of Indians, Poles, and Canadians, has not accepted <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> as a legal activity and has continuously questioned the legality under the Accords. Correspondence on the matter continues between the Vietnamese Government and the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>. During the first nine months of its existence, starting with June 1, 1956, <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> has accomplished the following:</p>
<list>
<item>1. Shipped out more than $36,000,000 worth of <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> equipment (acquisition cost) from Viet-Nam, notably to Taiwan, Thailand, the Philippines and Japan. This is over and above the $137,000,000 worth of MAP equipment that had been shipped out prior to the <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> augmentation of the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>.</item>
<item>2. Converted the Vietnamese armed forces to the U.S.-type supply system, and assisted in the establishment of a functional logistical organization.</item>
<item>3. Arranged for the participation of Philippine technicians in on-the-job training, and made available spare parts and tools so that equipment could be maintained.</item>
<item>4. Assisted in the opening of the Saigon shipyard for the Vietnamese Navy.</item>
<item>5. Implemented a vehicle rebuilding program outside Viet-Nam.</item>
<item>6. Redistributed substantial amounts of matériel turned over by the French to the Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Lao armed forces.</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_828" n="828" facs="0858"/>
<item>7. Also 391 Vietnamese military organizations were subjected to detailed end-use inspection and deficiencies were called to the attention of the Vietnamese authorities.<note n="2" xml:id="d389fn2">The following marginal note is written on the source text in <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>’s own hand: “<persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Howard</persName>, this is an excellent record and proves the wisdom of the policy.

<p>191. Re: <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 173.<note n="2" xml:id="d391fn2">In this telegram, July 26, the Embassy reported on a conversation with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in which he recounted a July 23 conversation with T.N. Kaul, the Indian Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>. Kaul informed <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> that the time was ripe to hold elections to unify Vietnam because, if properly supervised, elections would result in a pro-<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> majority in the North. Kaul did pose the question, however, whether or not <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> could count on a majority in the South. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> argued that China would never allow unification except under Communist rule and questioned how he could disband and render ineffective “600,000 Viet Minh troops.” Furthermore, a unified Vietnam would have to be neutralist and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was unprepared to accept neutralism. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.00/7–2457)</note> <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> asked me to call July 25 and held forth for hour and half on India.</p>
<p>1. He opened by saying he had been thinking over carefully suggestions made by Kaul which he had discussed with me the other day (reference telegram). After warning I should keep this information strictly confidential he said that last year a high Indian official had approached him with following proposal: A. India thought it could obtain from <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiComs</gloss> solemn declaration of non-aggression against unified Vietnam.</p>
<p>B. <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiComs</gloss> would no longer endeavor exert any influence North Vietnam provided Americans pulled out of South Vietnam.</p>
<p>C. On this basis India felt confident it could bring about unification of country.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> informed Indian he could not accept proposal because: A. Could not trust word of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiComs</gloss>.</p>
<p>B. Viet Minh army many times larger than <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s.</p>
<p>C. If Americans withdrew military and other support <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could not maintain defense forces and so would become easy victim of north even if Chinese remained “neutral”.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> then said he believed Kaul proposal another version of last year’s approach but baited with story of deep discontent in north <pb xml:id="pg_830" n="830" facs="0860"/>and assurances all people would vote for south in controlled free elections.</p>
<p>2. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> attributed these approaches to unrealistic mystic attitude of Indians who hoped to play big role in Asia but according <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> their policy has basically failed and India now only fully neutralist country Southeast Asia. He convinced Burma waivering as neutralist, admitted Ceylon paid lip service to neutralism and Sukarno was running into serious opposition from majority of Indonesians because of neutralist attitude. Therefore <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has impression neutralism has lost much of its appeal in Asia since Bandung conference. He said he now believed friendly Indian attitude toward <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> due primarily to fact that through its alliance with western bloc and American, Australian and British aid and support, country is succeeding. This success <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> believes had influenced most other Commonwealth countries to look askance at Indian neutralism. Although realizing its previous policies have not worked India still hopes play prominent role in Asia. Therefore while it will remain neutralist in order to gain time to build up its economy, India basically impressed by progress <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> which contrary to initial Indian belief has shown it could stop Communist advance in <gloss>SEA</gloss>. For this reason and despite its neutralist attitude India would continue to be more friendly toward <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
<p>3. When I asked <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> if he thought it would be possible for anyone to change basic Indian policy and philosophy he said he had discussed subject with his brother Bishop Thuc. Both thought Indians were too mystic, unrealistic and timid as a people to adopt any other policy than the timid one of neutralism and “goodwill”. While <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> had held India together he was an aristocrat with no feeling for the masses and no spiritual dynamism that would permit him to lead his country in a war to maintain its independence.</p>
<p>4. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> next discussed visit of Indian Vice President due here September 18. I asked whether he thought Indians would try to use visit for any substantive purpose. He replied they might but it would be merely effort exert Indian influence here which would fall on deaf ears if they persisted in trying to make Vietnam move in neutralist direction.</p>
<p>5. I referred to announced visit of <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> to Delhi in future and he replied it was his understanding <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho</persName> would visit Delhi next spring. He then laughed and said since Vietminh had heard about his own visit to Delhi from November 4 to 8 they also desired to go and the Indians of course had to accept to keep pretense of neutrality.</p>
<p>6. I told <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> I had heard a year or so ago in confidence from Indian officials that in their hearts they were pleased <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> existed because it formed barrier to communist flood. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> replied this was <pb xml:id="pg_831" n="831" facs="0861"/>probably true because <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> was getting more organized and effective and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> with American and other free world assistance had shown that even small country like Vietnam could not only maintain its independence but make steady progress.</p>
<p>7. On several occasions <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said it was probable China and Russia were now asking themselves what they were getting out of friendship with India now that it had not only failed to enlarge neutralist bloc but this bloc was diminishing in effectiveness. I questioned the latter point by reminding him that Cambodia, Laos and as far as I knew Burma and Ceylon were still essentially neutralist. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> replied he was convinced India regretted having induced Cambodia to be neutralist and urged Laos in same direction because all this had done was increase <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> penetration in those countries. He also reiterated his conviction neutralism in Burma and Ceylon was weakening. He attributed this in part at least to example of Vietnam which had increased in stability and progressed very well through its close association with free world.</p>
<p>8. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> From this long discussion of Indian history, philosophy, religion, lack of real spiritual values it seems to me <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has been thinking about problem of India’s position for long time and has apparently decided not much could be done to influence Indians although he still hopes they will be more friendly toward <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
<p>I purposely introduced the subject of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and from <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s reaction do not believe we should pin our hopes on his asking for closer relations with that organization at this time.</p>

</list>
<p>The President was in a good mood. After the usual introductory remarks and discussion of the teletype reports of the day, he made a few flippant comments about the possibility of his marrying a Lao <pb xml:id="pg_832" n="832" facs="0862"/>princess, and discussed briefly (a) the weakness of the Cambodian Government, (b) the fact that he does not know the new Cambodian Prime Minister at all but doesn’t think very highly of him, and (c) the apparent solution of the Chinese problem as evidenced by the small numbers of Chinese who were actually leaving the country.</p>
<p>He then mentioned that General Oai was being replaced provisionally as Director General of the Civil Guard by Mr. Vu Tien Huan, who will continue also as Assistant for Internal Security to the Secretary of State for Interior. He commented that General Oai had made a number of statements, that he talked well, that he was not too bad a soldier, but that he had not, shall we say, “produced.” That is to say, he had promised to make several changes in the Civil Guard, he had told the President he was making those changes, and he had then told the President he had make them. However, the President now learned that the changes had not in fact been made, that General Oai had simply talked a lot and had done nothing along those lines.</p>
<p>The changes in question involved the mass tranfer of Civil Guard units from their home provinces, that is, the provinces in which their members were recruited, to other provinces in order to develop a sense of national unity on the part of the Guardsmen. As it was, the Civil Guardsman felt loyalty to only his province, and when there was trouble in an adjacent province, he and his officers felt no urge to accept the call for assistance which came from that other province, go over there and clean up whatever mess existed. This, the President said, must stop. We are a nation; we are not a conglomeration of independent provinces, and regardless of all that General Oai had said, he had not carried out these Presidential orders.</p>
<p>It should be noted that this constituted a 180-degree reversal of the President’s earlier expressed opinions concerning General Oai, his abilities, his vigor, his dynamism, the fact that he was one of the most promising young men and would clean up and reorganize the Civil Guard. It also is interesting to tie these remarks to the comments made to me<note n="2" xml:id="d392fn2">i.e., <persName corresp="#p_FWR1">Fishel</persName>.</note> by General Oai at dinner when we were together last Sunday evening (July 28) when General Oai commented that his Deputy, Colonel Cuong, whom he had left in charge of the Civil Guard when he went to take over the Fifth Military Region, was trying to give him a “kick in the tail” in an effort to get him out of the job of Director General and take it over himself. And the General was quite concerned that his colonel might succeed. He claimed the <pb xml:id="pg_833" n="833" facs="0863"/>colonel was painting a bleak picture of what had been accomplished, when, in point of fact, he, the general, had accomplished a great deal and intended to be given credit for it. The President’s remarks would indicate that the colonel’s words carried more weight than had the general’s.</p>
<p>Virtually the rest of the morning was devoted to a discussion of administration in Vietnam and a justification, quite defensive for the most part, by the President of his continual interference in the affairs of his ministers and his tendency to go around them rather than through them, to check up on them by talking with their underlings, and so on. (He became even more defensive when Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW1">Ladejinsky</persName> observed that it was commonly assumed that the President made all government decisions himself.) Present at the the breakfast also with the President, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW1">Ladejinsky</persName>, and myself, were Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> and [name and title deleted]. The President praised Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> several times during the course of the breakfast and seemed to have complete confidence in him, both as an individual and as an administrator. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> agreed whole-heartedly with probably 95% of what the President said and commented after the breakfast that we had heard the true views of the President, rather than some of the things which he occasionally said for publication or just to be nice; that these were indeed the President’s innermost thoughts. (As a matter of fact, I had heard the President express many of these thoughts before, but this was the first time that I had heard him express them all in such a steady stream for so long a time, and indeed so defensively. At one point, he even referred to criticisms I had made of his administrative methods, which I had made to his face, nearly three years ago when I was new in Vietnam and was trying to get him to delegate authority and responsibility to lesser officials in his Government.)</p>
<p>Generally speaking, he said, the quality of my ministers is very poor. They are, for the most part, honest men, but you understand that in Vietnam in the last ten years we have had no training of <hi rend="italic">fonctionnaires</hi> which has been sufficient to turn out men who understand even the routine of their jobs. The average fonctionnaire is incompetent. He is a man who may have had the proper cultural training to turn him into a good civil servant, or he may not. He has, in all probability, very little real capacity to do or to understand the work which he should be doing. He is sometimes intelligent, sometimes less intelligent, but whether he is a good man or not he is, generally speaking, untrained, and this is true of the ministers, even as it is of the lesser members of the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the President feels compelled to spend much time dictating this and that; instructing his officials in the rudiments of administration. He cited the lack of control and understanding manifested by some of his ministers vis-à-vis administrative problems <pb xml:id="pg_834" n="834" facs="0864"/>which came before them. In particular, he mentioned an incident involving Secretary of State for Finance, Mr. Ha Van Vuong, as an illustration of the weakness of members of his cabinet, with the obvious exception of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> and the occasional exception of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Nguyen huu Chau</persName>. (See terminal note.<note n="3" xml:id="d392fn3">Attached “Terminal Note” is not printed.</note>) In discussing the shortcomings of Secretary of State Vuong, the President noted that when he himself had been a young man he had been the scourge of wrongdoers. He gave a specific example of how a good education, sharp eyes, and a clear head made it possible for him to catch a district judge in a falsification which rendered him unfit for office. Briefly, the story was as follows.</p>
<p>[Here follow two paragraphs recording <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s detailed description of this episode.]</p>
<p>However, said he, some of the present day civil servants don’t show as much energy and initiative as he remembers himself showing in his youth. Province chiefs sometimes do not get out and see all the people in their provinces; district chiefs often do not know what goes on in villages with [<hi rend="italic">within</hi>] their districts; and in the ministries in Saigon there are civil servants who never get out in the country to learn about the services which they head within their ministries in Saigon.</p>
<p>This brought the President to the question of briefings given him by his ministers during cabinet sessions or privately and of reports which were requested or expected of provincial chiefs, district chiefs, and other field officers. By and large, the quality of such briefings and reports was extremely poor. As a matter of fact, I might note here that in March of this year, just before my departure for the United States, the President had made similar statements to me and had asked if the <gloss target="#t_MSUG1">MSUG</gloss> could prepare a guide for briefings for his ministers and a report guide for his provincial chiefs, provided he made available to us some of the briefing materials which his ministers and reports which his chiefs of province had submitted to him. I agreed that we could and would, and subsequently <gloss target="#t_MSUG1">MSUG</gloss> prepared a sample report form for the provinces; however, the President never made available the briefing and report materials he had promised, and the matter stood thus until this day. And when the President brought up the question of the poor quality of the briefings and reports that he received from his officials, I reminded him of this earlier incident which apparently had escaped his memory.</p>
<p>He took this occasion to point out how few civil servants really understood how to present a report to a superior. At this point also, many of his prejudices <hi rend="italic">against</hi> northerners and southerners and <hi rend="italic">for</hi> people of the center, who are, in his opinion and in that of [name <pb xml:id="pg_835" n="835" facs="0865"/>deleted], far superior either to northerners or southerners, came to the surface as they often do. He remarked, as is his wont, that the northerners are facile of tongue, are good pedagogues, write very well—indeed often beautifully—and are by all odds the most skillful writers, lecturers, professors in Vietnam. When they write a report, however, they are not content to report the facts—they embroider them, they make beautiful literature out of them, and in so doing they often lose sight of their objective. They become infatuated with the beauty of their prose and the result is that their report reads beautifully, sounds eloquent when read aloud, but very often doesn’t make the points it should. Northerners are extremely didactic and very clannish—where you find one northerner, you find very soon five northerners, and where these five are then you will find 50, and so on.</p>
<p>The southerner, by contrast, does no writing, generally speaking; he has no eloquence of tongue, and in most respects is the reverse of the northerner. But the man from the central provinces embodies the best virtues of north and south. He is more direct, he is more honest, he is not quite so eloquent, but he is more reliable in most respects than either his northern or southern compatriots.</p>
<p>This in turn, led the President to review the development of administrative training and education in Vietnam since the earliest days of the Vietnamese emperors on through the French colonial period and up to the present time. The only new statements he made were with respect to the training of the past ten years, which he said had been virtually nonexistent. Whereas during the imperial days and during the period of French rule young civil servants were taught how to write reports, how to make out a form, how to do all the routine practical things which a civil servant should know, in the past years such techniques had been lost. Most of the civil servants of today, he repeated, didn’t even know how to prepare, for example, an order of service. He, the President himself, frequently had to edit, to correct, to rewrite orders of service which had been prepared by lesser officials. This was true of almost every form he could think of, and he had himself created new forms for the civil servants because they didn’t seem to have any judgment of their own. Therefore, he felt that the curriculum of the National Institute of Administration, which was the hope of future in respect to the training of civil servants, should be more practical than it had been in the past, less legalistic and more practical, less philosophical and more practical.</p>
<p>The sine qua non of a good administrator is a good formal education. One of the troubles with the Institute was that most of the professors came from the north. And like all northerners, they were eloquent; they taught the students philosophy; they taught the students all sorts of nice metaphysical things, but they didn’t teach <pb xml:id="pg_836" n="836" facs="0866"/>them how to think, and they didn’t teach them the practical things which an administrator should know when he goes out into the field. An administrator should be able on his own to order supplies, to report a crime, to write an order of service, to arrest a man and fill out the forms properly, and to write a decision in a case over which he is presiding as judge, and so on. The quality of the professors at the Institute (and by this he made clear that he meant the Vietnamese professors) was very poor, but it was very difficult to find men from the center or from the south to serve on the faculty. When he found such men who were capable, it was more important that they go into positions in the administration than that they spend their time teaching at the Institute. Therefore, it was more necessary than ever that we form good young professors to teach at the Institute.</p>
<p>Throughout this discussion, he referred again and again to the fact that he found it necessary as a result of the shortcomings that he had noted among his ministers and other civil servants, to go down into the administration himself and pull out people and get them to report to him personally so that he could be sure of having the facts, because his ministers didn’t know how to get the facts and he had to teach them. He had given them all the responsibility and all the authority they needed. He had delegated, and delegated, and delegated, but they had proved unworthy of the delegation of authority and responsibility time and again, and this was why he felt constrained to step into the breach which existed and bring order out of the chaos. Several times during the conversation, the word chaos attracted him, and he spoke of the chaos of Taoism, the fact that the philosophy of many of the people of Vietnam, both of the north and of the south, was Taoist. These people felt that out of the chaos which reigned about them order would inevitably and spontaneously arise and then everything would be beautiful. However, he commented, “Unfortunately, I am not content to wait for the chaos around me to turn into order of its own accord. I am going to try to bring order out of chaos myself.”</p>
<p>Again, at one point, he referred to the willingness of people on the outside, such as those he refers to as <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Dai</persName>-Viet types and Viet-Minh, to criticize officials within the Government who are trying to do a good job, and the person who is the brunt of most of the criticism these days is Secretary of State for National Economy and Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Nguyen Ngoc Tho</persName>. Mr <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName>, he said, was an examplary civil servant, and yet, look at the scurrilous treatment to which he is subjected by citizens of Vietnam. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> nodded approvingly during this discussion and seemed quite amused by the fact that he receives every week many dozens of letters, all, it seems, anonymous, many scurrilous, all pointing out shortcomings in the administration of the National Economy Department or other departments. In response <pb xml:id="pg_837" n="837" facs="0867"/>to my questioning, he said he personally read every single letter and had found that many of them contained elements of truth but the large majority were totally false. He seemed unconcerned by the criticism, however, indicating that his shoulders were broad and he could take it.</p>

<p>Paragraph 2. <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> originally approved by joint State/Defense/<gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> message <gloss target="#t_Def1">DEF</gloss> 92661 dated 8 Feb 56<note n="3" xml:id="d393fn3">Not printed.</note> which authorized $6.2 million for <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> support during <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 56 and tentatively programmed same amount for <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 57. Message further stated “inasmuch as corps are not fully organized assume all temporarily allocated funds <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 56 may not be needed since plan based on salaries for full 2 months.” Funds were budgeted on a calendar year basis and no authority exists to transfer unobligated balance of 56 to the same chapter of the following year. Nonexpended <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 56 and 57 funds cannot be utilized in <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 58. Recruitment difficulties were not only cause delay in establishing <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>. Unsettled condition of country and many pressing governmental problems contributed to delay. Although Washington approved <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> on 8 Feb and government was reminded continuously delay in establishing <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> meant loss of funds, a Presidential decree forming the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> was not issued until 4 April 56. Furthermore, first official <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> units not formed until June 56. Since no funds were obligated or expended as of 30 April 56, country team directed withdrawal 94.3 million piasters in credit allocations on 18 June 56. The Vietnamese <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> request for reestablishment of this credit was denied on 21 Aug 56 by country team. <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 57 budget approved by Washington included $6.2 million for <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>’s support. Current expenditures based on present strength indicate that during remainder of <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 57 there will be a savings of about 15 million piasters.</p>
<p>Paragraph 3. By country team decision budget now being prepared for submission to Washington will include $3.1 million for <pb xml:id="pg_838" n="838" facs="0868"/>support of <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> for <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 58. Until Washington action on budget is announced availability of funds for <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> during <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 58 will be unknown.</p>
<p>Paragraph 4. After careful study problem country team recommends US support a 30,000 <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> at rate of 300 piasters per man per month for <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 58. Maximum strength of <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> of 58,377 was attained throughout period Dec 56–Mar 57. Since Mar 1957 there has been gradual reduction to strength of 49,773 as of 27 July 57. Original plan for <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> was that by <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 58 internal security situation and overall development of Vietnam would have progressed to point where combined efforts of provinces and national government could finance project. Effective distribution in critical areas only, combining command and administrative functions with Civil Guard and acceptance of additional financial burdens by provinces can reasonably be accomplished. Such action would reduce need for US support by approximately one half. This does not mean <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> cannot be larger than 30,000 if government wishes to finance additional strength. However, country team position is that a 30,000 <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> can probably meet its particular internal security requirement during <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 58 if Vietnamese attack the problem realistically and conscientiously. It is doubtful that such action can be promoted until exact amount of <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 58 US support for <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> is known. An early Washington decision is recommended prior to final budget action to facilitate Vietnamese internal security planning for <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 58.</p>
<p>It obvious from <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> memo July 17 to Dept as well as from SecState Interior <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName>’s conversation with me July 31 (memo conversation follows<note n="4" xml:id="d393fn4">In despatch 56 from Saigon, August 9. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.5–MSP/8–957)</note>) that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> wants US to provide funds for 60,000 <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> not only for <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss>s 1956 and 57 but also for 1958 without regard to actual strength of Corps. This has never been US concept of our support of <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>. As stated under para 2 above unexpended <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 56 and 57 funds cannot be used in 1958 and as of this time we feel situation is such that US should support <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> of only 30,000 in <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 58.</p>

<p>1. On 3d <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> brought up question aid for 60,000 Self Defense Corps along line similar to <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName>’s arguments<note n="3" xml:id="d394fn3">In despatch 56 from Saigon; see <ref target="#d393fn4">footnote 4, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi></ref>.</note> (viz. there had been unavoidable delays in setting up <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>; use of <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> at full 60,000 strength plus Civil Guard would release army from internal security duties; <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would have to change its central budget plans unless we provided funds for 60,000). <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> added (1) unfortunately Civil Guard not developing satisfactorily, (2) he therefore had relieved General <persName corresp="#p_TVS1">Soai</persName> from Civil Guard command, (3) unfortunately dissident groups led or encouraged by Vietminh becoming more active many parts of the country, particularly along Cambodian border, (4) he had been led to believe on basis original discussion aid for <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> we would support effort for two full years regardless of when implementation started.</p>
<p>2. He pointed out <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had for reasons beyond its control not been able implement <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> organization as soon as hoped and he realized we had made it clear aid would be given only to those actually on duty <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>. He then pled for “full amount promised” arguing this important due difficulties effectively organizing Civil Guard and increased Vietminh-inspired terrorism. His plans for increased internal security would be seriously affected if money not forthcoming.</p>
<p>I told him after conversation with <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName> matter being studied but based on preliminary evaluation I believed it would be difficult justify aid for more than 30,000 effectives since (1) it had been made clear our <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> aid was temporary, (2) money allocated <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 56 had not been utilized due slow organization <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>, (3) under our fiscal system funds not obligated reverted to Treasury at end fiscal year and (4) it had been our understanding <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> costs would be assumed by provincial and municipal budgets within one or two years after Corps established. Therefore the recommendation had been made to give aid during <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 58 for only 30,000 effectives which seemed sufficient to tide them over until provincial and municipal budgets could handle the situation. I added that if he felt strongly we should continue to give aid for more than 30,000 we would probably have to take those funds from other aid projects he also interested in. Worthwhile report he twice stated in passing decision to cut <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> aid probably is indication there will be serious reduction in over-all <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> aid <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 58. <pb xml:id="pg_840" n="840" facs="0870"/>I replied while there may be cuts we have no indication what they will be, if any. President urged we reconsider decision in view necessity step up counter-subversive activities.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> In absence of more definite information regarding <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s plans for <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> and of an evaluation of SDCV effectiveness against subversive activities, it difficult at this juncture to comment intelligently on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s plea. As pointed out in <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 236 <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> never reached full 60,000 strength and has been gradually reduced since March 1957 to 49,783 as of July 27. I have accordingly asked elements of country team concerned to re-study question so that we may have a better idea whether a larger <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> could make effective contribution to internal security under present conditions.</p>

<p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Admiral Stump</persName>: Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> has raised the question repeatedly about the 20,000 increase that was asked for. What we are going to tell <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, etc.? Repeatedly I’ve told the Country Team that my guess was that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would not raise the question again in the immediate future. Apparently my remarks make no impression as the subject is brought up again and again and the conversation leads nowhere.</p>
<p>Apparently about a month ago Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> wrote asking <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> expected a written statement from Washington on the subject.<note n="2" xml:id="d395fn2">Letter dated July 11, not found.</note> Attached is a copy of the Ambassador’s reply.<note n="3" xml:id="d395fn3">In this letter dated August 7, <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> stated that although <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had not mentioned the proposal for a 20,000-man increase in the Vietnamese armed forces to him, he had suggested to <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName> in a conversation held shortly after the President’s trip to the United States that <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName> go to Washington to plead for the increase. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> had refused. “<persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> speculated, however, that since <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> had been told that <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> was opposed to the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> recommendation for an increase of 20,000 effectives, it is possible the President might raise the question again some time after <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> ceased to be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.”</note></p>
<p>Frankly, I don’t think <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will say anything more until he sees how the budgetary discussions come out.</p>

<p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Roads.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> went into considerable detail on his currently most preoccupying question—the need for adequate but expanded and not too expensive road network in high plateau with appropriate connections to coast of central Vietnam. Using specially prepared multi-colored map showing (a) population concentration along coast and in delta, (b) mountain areas, (c) high plateau area and (d) Mekong valley, he developed his strategy of filling high plateau with trusted energetic people from central Vietnam and demobilized troops who could develop agricultural economy of plateau and form “human wall” buffer to Communist infiltration from west. While he expressed appreciation excellent work being done by American contractors their roads too expensive and too elaborate for urgently needed larger network of less expensive but good roads in high plateau area to assist new settlers have access to rest of country and help movement of production. It imperative have such network soonest and therefore roads that could stand up for only five years without too much maintenance would meet immediate imperative needs. Once good foundations made roads could be improved later. He did not emphasize road to Laos, which referred to only in connection general need for roads. <pb xml:id="pg_842" n="842" facs="0872"/>In conversation 26th he made special plea for assistance build Ban Methuot–Kontum road as key road in area but this need not be to high standards planned for Bien Hoa or Ban Methuot–Ninh Hoa roads by American contractors.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Reasons urgency road network.</p>
<p>a. Viet Minh propaganda coupled with Indian <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> urging for unification of country by “free elections” placing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> in embarrassing position because cannot agree open up communications with north or permit free travel between zones until settlers in plateau area are thriving and contented in their new environment.</p>
<p>b. If he should permit free travel now, Viet Minh would send “200,000 agents disguised as refugees” who would nip in bud his plan to flesh out economic base of country by filling plateau void.</p>
<p>c. Would be disastrous to have free elections now since are 14 million in north against 12 million in south and with Viet Minh police state methods south would be outvoted.</p>
<p>d. He has to take immediate advantage of drive being shown since independence by energetic people from Central Vietnam who are pioneering plateau by effective methods to sustain this drive by improving their lot primarily through adequate and extensive road system. People in south less energetic and live in isolated groups which encourages banditry and Viet Minh infiltration. This could happen in plateau area unless vacant land occupied by contented people. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> made it clear he convinced regime would fall in next few years unless this accomplished. In his estimation he has maximum of three years to attain fundamental contentment plateau area which would give him solid enough base to make further progress later without fear of Viet Minh action or elections. This did not mean <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> giving up separate five year development plan.</p>
<p>e. Growing contentment in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> next few years (contrasted to Viet Minh need keep people suppressed by expensive armed forces supported by heavy taxation) will eventually force Viet Minh to demobilize large number of troops and liberalize regime which would then permit people in north bring about unification with south. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> feels same forces working in that direction in Communist China which cannot forever afford maintain large expensive army to suppress masses and will also have to liberalize.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Situation in Thailand.</p>
<p>In conversations 26th and 28th <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> claimed his increased preoccupation fill plateau void was emphatically strengthened by situation <pb xml:id="pg_843" n="843" facs="0873"/>he learned about in northeast Thailand during Bangkok visit.<note n="3" xml:id="d396fn3">August 15–19; a report on the highlights of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s Thailand visit, as recounted to <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> on August 20, is in telegram 393 from Saigon, August 21.

He added situation in Thailand very unhealthy with army and police each having approximately same strength under separate strong ministers which makes situation government very unstable. He asserted he would never permit two of his ministers to have such equal power and it essential in his opinion that government be backed by army alone under head of government. In general he then went over same ground re Bangkok visit reported <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 393.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">4. General impression.</p>
<p>Throughout conversation <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> made it clear essential everything including roads must be done in a hurry to make up for time lost in past. He stated emphatically next three years will be those of decision and if many of essential things are not accomplished, even on semi-temporary basis, South Vietnam cannot survive. He apparently seriously worried his plan for resettlement plateau area may backfire badly and cause downfall of regime unless he takes immediate steps to bring more contentment to pioneers. This essential also because plans next year to settle large numbers demobilized troops plateau area. This being done for security, pol[itical] and economic reasons, with security paramount.</p>

<p>Dear Admiral <persName>Anderson</persName>: Although I hate to bother a busy man with details from such a small element of the Pacific Command, I believe it well for you, <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Admiral Stump</persName> and certain members of your Staff to have the following information for general background.</p>
<p>On the 27th September, at a meeting of the Country Team, <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> discussed a mimeographed sheet of figures on budgetary matters (Incl # 1).<note n="2" xml:id="d397fn2">Not found.</note> It presents several alternatives based on the assumption aid to <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> will be cut 20%.<note n="3" xml:id="d397fn3">See <ref target="#d402">Document 402</ref>.</note> Purpose of discussion was to get agreement of Country Team for <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> to discuss these figures with the Vietnamese. It was agreed they should do so. I stipulated however, that it be made absolutely clear to the Vietnamese that the discussion was for planning, only. That we did not know what cuts would be made and the discussion was merely to generate thinking. To this <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> agreed and did carry out. (I had my Comptroller attend the meeting between <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and the Vietnamese to be sure this was done.) It certainly generated the thinking and more, just as I expected.</p>
<p>The President had a meeting at 1500 on 1 October, lasting two hours, during which he presented a very strong case for the Military <pb xml:id="pg_845" n="845" facs="0875"/>budget. Notes made by my interpreter (Incl # 2)<note n="4" xml:id="d397fn4">Not found attached. A typed record of this conference, dated October 1 and signed by Usera, is in Center of Military History, <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName> Papers, Conversations with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> 16 Sep 57–28 Dec 57.</note> are meager because of the rapidity of the conversation between the President and the Ambassador.</p>
<p>On more than one occasion the Ambassador attempted to switch the discussion to economic affairs without too much success. The President insisting [<hi rend="italic">insisted</hi>] that at this time he wanted to discuss the Military features of American aid only, and refused to be diverted.</p>
<p>He made two remarks that to me were of outstanding importance, neither of which the interpreter included in his notes.</p>
<p>The first was that in event cuts forced a choice between adequate Military funds and funds for economic growth, then the economic growth would have to wait. I consider this to be an important decision, a far reaching one. One [<hi rend="italic">It</hi>] gives an insight into his thinking as to conditions not only in Vietnam but this part of Asia.</p>
<p>His other remark that I considered of particular importance came about as follows: Speaking of peace time expenditures as contrast to war expenditures, things that we are all familiar with, such as in War more can be spent in a week than carried in a year’s peace time budget, etc., he said “Do you think the Americans want to see American G.I.s on the 17th Parallel”?, or words to that effect.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly this remark was made to more forcibly impress upon the Ambassador what he considered the seriousness of the situation. However, what ever his reason, he made it and I may add much to my surprise as he had never made such a remark in my hearing previously.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Situation in South Vietnam</item>
</list>
<p>1. This is in reply to your memorandum of 4 October 1957<note n="2" xml:id="d398fn2">In this memorandum <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> had asked <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName>, “in view of the categoric statements made by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> indicating that he gives paramount importance to building his armed forces to the possible detriment of beginning to build more solid economic and agricultural foundations,” to give his views on whether “it is absolutely essential to build up the armed forces as quickly as <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> desires, even to the detriment of an economic buildup, and whether you believe it would be necessary to maintain at least 50,000 [<hi rend="italic">150,000?</hi>] men under arms for the foreseeable future.” <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> also asked <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName> to contribute ideas for the recommendations to be made on a draft despatch on the general situation in Vietnam. (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.) For the despatch as sent on December 5, see <ref target="#d409">Document 409</ref>. Additional information on its preparation is in the despatch itself and in Spector, <hi rend="italic">The Early Years,</hi> pp. 304–305.</note> subject: “Draft Evaluation Paper<note n="3" xml:id="d398fn3">Draft not found.</note> on Situation in South Vietnam”.</p>
<p>2. The importance of the military in Vietnam should be viewed from three primary considerations:</p>
<list>
<item>a. First, there has been in the past a serious but today a less serious internal security problem. The pacification of the country is elementary in establishing and maintaining an economically sound and politically stable government. This is one of the basic objectives prescribed in U.S. aid programs. The nullification of adverse elements and a general reorientation of the entire populace toward American democratic ideals are major undertakings the success of which cannot be measured on a short range basis.</item>
<item>b. Second, the military provides a certain deterrent to aggression from outside sources. The wide dispersion of military and para-military units in the more remote and sensitive areas of South Vietnam definitely hinders the movement and activities of Viet Cong organizers and the spread of propaganda. The existence of combat units in being and stationed on likely avenues of approach to key areas within South Vietnam denies the Viet Cong the chance of a quick, easy military victory. This force is essential if aggression should occur in order to buy time to permit other friendly countries to react. Southeast Asia is one of the most vulnerable targets for communist expansion in the world today. Countries surrounding South Vietnam are probably particularly susceptible now and in the foreseeable future because of relatively unstable governments, low economic potential and small, weak military forces. These countries will undoubtedly be subjected to further political and economic subversions and some success may be anticipated. Under these circumstances, South <pb xml:id="pg_847" n="847" facs="0877"/>Vietnam’s military forces must be prepared to assume a dominant role as a deterrent to external aggression.</item>
<item>c. Third, the military, by continuously improving internal security and acting as a deterrent to external Communist aggression, certainly advances economic development and provides stability of the regime. One of the primary U.S. objectives in Southeast Asia is to develop in Vietnam a stable government which openly denounces communism and does not accept neutralism as a doctrine. Continued support of the military for the immediate future at its present level is essential if this objective is to attained. Any reduction in U.S. contributions to the military budget and a failure of the <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> government to make up the difference would necessitate some adjustment in the force level. However, it appears at this time that even though some reduction in the U.S. contribution to the military budget may be made during <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1958, in all probability the Vietnamese will not make any reduction in existing force levels during this period regardless of the cost to them.</item>
</list>
<p>3. The President undoubtedly wishes to “build up” the armed forces quickly. I think his sincere purpose has been to emphasize to American officials the need for maintaining the forces he now has and increasing their capability to meet the tension arising from internal or external sources or a combination of both and further and additionally to get an increase in troop strength, if possible. It appears to me that the President’s reaction and comment over a possible reduction in the U.S. support in 1958 military budgets stemmed from his desire, as head of state, to maintain the best military posture possible in order to assure continued political and economical development. Further efforts on the part of U.S. agencies to work with him in developing solutions to problems in these fields probably will alleviate such anxiety to a degree.</p>
<p>4. As to the size of the military forces in Vietnam in the foreseeable future, some reduction may be possible and feasible. The timing of adjustments in the <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> military structure is currently under study. It appears in light of the existing situation that, for planning purposes, the calendar year 1960 may be a reasonable time period for a possible reduction in forces. This <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> is presently developing a five year mid-range plan which it is hoped will provide the blue print for interim development of detailed plans.</p>
<p>5. As to the Embassy draft submitted to me for comment on 1 October 1957, I wish to repeat that my impression of the general situation existing in South Vietnam today does not permit me to agree with the evaluation depicted in the proposed dispatch. During my service in South Vietnam, I have experienced many setbacks or delays within short term periods. However, in the perspective of longer periods, there have been many outstanding political, economical and military accomplishments in consonance with U.S. objectives.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_848" n="848" facs="0878"/>
<p>6. The receipt in Washington of the prepared dispatch, as being indicative of present conditions in Vietnam, would unquestionably cause alarm and provoke unnecessary concern. The draft paper is too broad and general in many vital areas and tends to reflect opinions rather than facts. The reports which I have seen do not indicate a state of “considerable concern” regarding the internal security, the economic situation or the executive ability of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Accordingly, I do not favor the dispatch of the proposed draft that I have studied.</p>
<p>7. I do agree that our most immediate and essential task here is to continue efforts to influence the President and his regime to make sound decisions on a timely basis and move forward on broad economic, social and military programs.<note n="4" xml:id="d398fn4"><p>In a letter dated December 9 to Admiral <persName>Anderson</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> stated that in a written report to <persName corresp="#p_CCG1">Chapman</persName> dated November 22, not found, concerning a second draft of the despatch discussed in <ref target="#d398fn2">footnote 2</ref> above, he had commented that there “was little variation in language and subject matter in the two drafts although there was considerable moderation in tone. That the thought continued that the President had failed in this task or was on his way to failure and to that I could not subscribe. That I could not agree that the President must be re-oriented from his Military Policy and the country thus become weakened in that field. Additionally, I suggested that since the Embassy felt so strongly about their paper they might consider sending it as an Embassy paper and not as a ‘Country Team Paper’.”</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName> continued:</p>
<p>“At a meeting on about the 26th November we were each handed a new summary sheet and asked to agree to it. I agreed to the summary provided they changed its opening paragraph. It was then modified. I was again asked if I would agree to the entire paper and I declined referring to my written answer of 22 November.</p>
<p>“On 5th December there was sent to me a covering statement in which my prior non-concurrence was stated and a request that I submit comments on the part that referred to my views at once as Embassy would pouch the paper that day. I replied that my views had been properly stated. (I was happy to note that this covering statement consisted of 2 1/4 pages further toning down the evaluation paper to a degree.)” (Center of Military History, <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName> Papers, Office Correspondence July–Dec 1957 (16))</p></note></p>

<p>140755Z. <gloss target="#t_MAGCH1">MAGCH</gloss> 6564. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Barrows</persName>, Director <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>, states Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName>, Minister to the Presidency, 9 October discussed with him organization and operations of the Civil Guard saying President wished to attach Civil Guard organizationally to Department of Defense and would possibly make written request to that effect. Yesterday President indicated to me during long conference on many subjects<note n="2" xml:id="d399fn2">See <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</note> he did intend to write such letter. Basically, as I see it, the problem is this: The President believes, a. Civil Guard should be officered as good [<hi rend="italic">well</hi>] as Army or better and be adequately equipped and trained for use as a national police force but capable of assisting Army in rear areas as para-military force in time of war. b. That Civil Guard has retained many worthless Officers and NCOs of little professional or academic education, is poorly trained, inadequately equipped, c. That these conditions can be correct [<hi rend="italic">corrected</hi>] if under <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>. From conversations with <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Barrows</persName> I understand University of Michigan Mission advises him. a. Guard should be equipped and trained along purely police lines, only. b. All Army or ex-Army Officers and NCOs should be removed from the Guard, c. Guard should not be under <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>. My comment. Although having no responsibility for Civil Guard organization, training or equipment have advocated repeatedly to the Country Team guard standards be raised to enable it more quickly take over additional pacification duties delta area, thus releasing Army troops for combat training. At one time President placed Army Brig General Oai in command all Civil Guard later gave him additional duty as fifth region commander. Job too big for one man so Oai relieved overall command of guard. Now has fifth region only. However, as such has all Army troops and all Civil Guard in fifth (delta) region under his command. My impression from Civil [Guard] sources considerable jealousy between Civil Guard and Army in fifth region. Additionally get impression <gloss target="#t_MSU1">MSU</gloss> also has dim view of Self Defense Corps. Certainly someone is passing plenty of adverse criticism of <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> to members Country Team mostly on charge Viet Cong infiltration of which I cannot get evidence. <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Barrows</persName> suggests hidden motive of President desire may be to get financial assistance Civil Guard from Military budget. However as U.S. does not contribute to pay and allowance of Civil Guard <pb xml:id="pg_850" n="850" facs="0880"/>doubt President has such motive. President having discussed these differences in concepts of command and equipment with me on several occasions I asked him yesterday why he didn’t use Doctor <persName corresp="#p_FWR1">Fishel</persName> head MSUM, one of his intimate advisors, to resolve difficulties. He replied <persName corresp="#p_FWR1">Fishel</persName> was incapable in this instance. Consequently suggested he call <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Barrows</persName> in and explain his concepts personally and in detail prior to or at time of submitting letter.<note n="3" xml:id="d399fn3"><p><persName corresp="#p_BL1">Barrows</persName> discussed the Civil Guard with <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName> on October 17, and described the meeting in a memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> dated October 18. (Center of Military History, <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName> Papers, Record of Conversation between President and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> (120)) The Vietnamese letter on the Civil Guard, addressed to <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Barrows</persName> from <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName> and dated November 2, was transmitted to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_MAGCH1">MAGCH</gloss> 6658, November 4 (040721Z).

<p>In a preliminary conversation with <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName> on November 7 concerning the new Vietnamese concept of the Civil Guard’s function, <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> stated that “it would be difficult for us to see our way clear to furnish the Civil Guard arms on the present <gloss target="#t_MSU1">MSU</gloss> list if in a year or two under the new concept they would need different types of arms. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName> admitted that this raised a difficult problem but made no specific suggestion.” <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> stated further that it was not clear to him “where the Self Defense Corps fitted into the picture under the new Civil Guard concept. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName> was not too clear in his answer but stated that the Self Defense Corps would be a completely separate organization from the Civil Guard, would be static, and act primarily as village policemen.” (Memorandum of conversation between <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbow</persName>; transmitted to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_MAGCH1">MAGCH</gloss> 6699 from Saigon, November 13 (130315Z); <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.)</p></note> Believe this will now develop into hot subject as President has been expressing same views on different occasions for about two years.</p>

The last time, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FWR1">Fishel</persName> had told the President he had cleared certain individuals through the Sûreté and he had explained to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FWR1">Fishel</persName> that Sûreté had no dossiers on people from the North and could not give proper political clearances—only the Secretary to the Presidency—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName>—could do this.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_852" n="852" facs="0882"/>
<p>The President stated that many of the employees of <gloss target="#t_MSU1">MSU</gloss> are <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Dai</persName> Viet who are insolent even towards high government officials and recently <gloss target="#t_MSU1">MSU</gloss> had difficulty in getting certain documents from the Ministries because the Ministries were not willing to have sensitive material handled by native employees of <gloss target="#t_MSU1">MSU</gloss> whom they considered politically suspect.</p>
<p>The President complained that <gloss target="#t_MSU1">MSU</gloss> failed to understand his concept for the Garde Civile. They wanted to form the Garde Civile as a rural police force whereas he wanted a para-military force under the Ministry of Defense but used by the Ministry of Interior during peace-time. The President said he wanted a force similar to the Civil Guard used in Europe and other areas with excellent results. He envisaged a small percentage of the Garde Civile to be used as rural police with mobile units armed with regular weapons, including mortars, and signal equipment, which could be moved quickly to trouble spots and be capable of acting against riots or strikes in population centers including the capability of running railways or public utilities in case of need. In war time the Garde Civile would take over the defense of rear areas allowing the Battle Corps to be fully available for front line service.</p>
<p>In order to achieve such a force, the President felt he had to replace the inefficient cadres presently commanding the Garde Civile and replace them with Army Officers as soon as he had a surplus of these latter. <gloss target="#t_MSU1">MSU</gloss> was against this and saw no need for ex-army officers in the units. He, on the other hand, wanted officers for the Garde Civile who had finished Dalat and had an additional year of training in law and police methods.</p>
<p>The President complained that <gloss target="#t_MSU1">MSU</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> seemed to think that the same organizations could be used in Vietnam as the ones being used in Michigan and this was not valid reasoning. With all the piracy and terrorism in areas of Vietnam, this was not peace but war.</p>
<p>The President stated he had prepared a letter which he was presenting to <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> on the Garde Civile. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> suggested that the President call in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Barrows</persName> and explain the military situation to him in detail before he presented the letter. That a letter of necessity had to be short and his concepts should be explained in detail and direct to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Barrows</persName> and not thru a third party.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">11. USIS:—</p>
<p>The President mentioned the fact that USIS also failed to obtain clearances for personnel they chose to go to US schools. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> said he understood that all Vietnamese Civilians chosen for schools were presented to a board of <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> civilians for approval. The President said that this board was composed of professors and others <pb xml:id="pg_853" n="853" facs="0883"/>who checked on the educational and professional eligibility of the prospective students but who could not judge their political background or reliability. USIS had been told that only the Secretary to the Presidency could give official political clearance and authorize the necessary visas but USIS had declared that “their budget was their own, not subject even to the control of the Ambassador, and they would use these funds to send whomever they pleased”.</p>
<p>The President mentioned that, recently, USIS had sent to some government agency a list of spaces for training in the US and the Vietnamese working in USIS had taken advantage of their prior knowledge of the spaces to advise and urge friends and relatives to apply for the training. He felt that this was improper and that <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> government itself should be apprised of such opportunities so as to give wider distribution and opportunity to all Vietnamese to attend such training in the US. He felt that, in any event, political clearance had to be through the Secretary of the Presidency and not through extraneous agencies.</p>
<p>During this discussion of USIS the President made a most unusual remark. He picked up a tea cup from the table and said “if they want to take this cup or any property to the U.S. that is alright but if they want to take a Vietnamese Citizen, a human being, then they have to have proper permission. If they want slaves, then let them go to Africa for them” or words to that effect.</p>

<p>On October 22, at 7:25 a.m. Saigon time, a group of United States Army officers were injured in a dynamite explosion; 10 minutes later a busload of United States enlisted men were injured when their army bus was dynamited. At 1:08 p.m. the USIS Library in Saigon was bombed without injury to library personnel or users, but causing extensive damage. Initial intelligence reporting held that this violence was a part of a terrorist plan against United States personnel in Vietnam and United States agency offices instituted security procedures. It is unclear whether or not these procedures were the reason, but the attacks of October 22 proved to be isolated incidents. (Telegrams 843, 848, October 22, and 862, October 23, from Saigon; 751G.00/10–2257 and 751G.00/10–2357 respectively; Historical Office, Department of State, “Assaults on United States Diplomatic, Consular, and Information Installations Abroad, 1900–1965,” Research Project 709, September 1965)</p>

<p>“Persuade Pres <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> accept even proportionate share worldwide cut difficult enough in view repeated assurances firm US support beginning with conversation Pres <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> in May, and US admiration his vigorous anti Commie position. He has in fact intimated that to lump him with other recipients and to ask him to absorb proportional cut would be treating him unfairly, and damaging to his prestige. Cut of even $5 million below worldwide share would provoke charges US violating high level commitments, taking <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> for granted while continuing award large sums countries much less reliable than <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> in support US position.

<p>We have been discussing <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 58 aid with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and others<note n="3" xml:id="d402fn3">A report of a discussion, October 1, among <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> on aid to Vietnam is in despatch 115 from Saigon, October 8. (Department of State, Central Files, 751G.00/10–857) Another discussion on the same topic between <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> and Vietnamese Vice-President Tho, October 10, is in despatch 140, October 24. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.12/10–2457)</note> and have made it clear <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> will have to take substantial cut, probably as much as 20 percent, arguing Congress cut global figure 20 percent. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and others have reacted rather strongly and use following arguments:</p>
<list>
<item>1. After defeating Vietminh and sects in 1955–1956, these elements have regrouped and have stepped up terrorist operations (there seems no question this true although situation in hand). Therefore <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> holds he cannot reduce military and security expenditures during coming year.</item>
<item><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has gone so far, due to his apprehension about stepped up Communist activities, to indicate strongly must build up military-police forces even if means little or no economic development. (We believe he is a bit too apprehensive on this point and he should devote more aid and resources to economic development.)</item>
<item>2. Part of his apprehension re need military strength of his own, is due in large part to unfavorable developments in other <gloss>SEA</gloss> countries:
<pb xml:id="pg_855" n="855" facs="0885"/>
<list>
<item>(a) Neutralist Cambodia, he claims, is harboring Communist cadres who are stepping up attacks in <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> (this probably has basis in fact).</item>
<item>(b) RLG and PL seem to be getting together and Laos may well slip under Commie influence.</item>
<item>(c) After Thai elections Thailand may go toward neutralism or make further accommodation with <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiComs</gloss>.</item>
<item>(d) Most other countries, except Malaya, in South and Southeast Asia are already neutralist. Therefore, <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> may find itself isolated and alone on mainland as only fully committed Free World anti-Communist country.</item>
</list></item>
<item>3. Why should Vietnam, which has backed Free World and adopted all out anti-Communist policy, have to take proportional cut to global reduction set by Congress. They argue cut the soft neutralist countries more than 20 percent and reward those who follow US policies and are actually fighting Communists by military as well as political action.</item>
<item>4. If <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> does not get at least as much as last year less 20 percent imposed by Congressional cut, internal pressures will grow against <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s pro-US policies and dependence, with opposition making demagogic claim other countries seem be getting aid from both blocs, so why depend on US which cutting aid to <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>. Why not get aid from other bloc to make up for US cuts.</item>
</list>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> seriously, with considerable reason, beginning become apprehensive about <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> possible isolation in <gloss>SEA</gloss> and he also seems be more isolated from <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> people, both of which incline him to concentrate on military-police power. In his interests and ours he must be induced make essential decisions build up economic base to win confidence of <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> people. If aid cut to $175 million will be most difficult induce him devote more to econ development, just at time when we have begun to make some headway on this matter. What momentum we have gained in effort to push econ development will be lost if we do not have concrete means induce him pursue economic plans and projects he himself would postpone or neglect.</p>
<p>While we do not share his full apprehension of security versus development needs, our chances of inducing him to devote more attention and resources to economic development will be greatly reduced if we have to insist <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> take more than 20 percent cut. If we are not able effectively to get him to build up economic base and step up exports and if Congress further reduces aid next year, this small but vital piece of real estate in <gloss>SEA</gloss> may slip with the others in this area. This probably would mean <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> too would eventually go, but in any event we would lose a fairly staunch friend in the Asian mainland.</p>
<p>Therefore if we could give him for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 58 less than 20 percent cut we would be in much better position insist on more firm action in econ field. It would be clear it pays be firmly on our side. To receive <pb xml:id="pg_856" n="856" facs="0886"/>more than a 20 percent cut would almost certainly raise doubts on that score. It seems from here increased terrorist acts, which probably Communist inspired, as if by design aid longer-range Commie subversive campaign plan induce <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> devote too many resources to military-police effort and this in its turn, further lessens his appeal to <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> people, and minimizes contrast in standard of living between north and south.</p>
<p>I hope therefore you will find it possible to have full consideration given to the above factors before a final decision is made to cut <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> aid to $175 million and if at all possible accord <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> less than 20 percent cut so that they will receive more than $180 million we have been discussing with them.</p>

<p>The Country Team discussed the provision of funds in the 1958 budget for the Self-Defense Corps at a Country Team meeting in the Ambassador’s office on Tuesday, 5 November, beginning at 1000 hours. The following personnel attended: Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Barrows</persName>, Mr. Campbell, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCG1">Chapman</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWC1">Haraldson</persName>, Capt Brookings, Mr. Opal, [name deleted], Lt Col Haley, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Price</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BTD1">Bowie</persName>, Colonel Muir, Lt Col White, Major Gildersleeve.<note n="2" xml:id="d403fn2">Alan L. Campbell, Jr., and <persName corresp="#p_CCG1">Christian G. Chapman</persName> were both Political Officers with the rank of Second Secretary. Wesley G. Haraldson, Deputy Director of the U.S. Operations Mission; Captain Robert S. Brookings II, Naval Attaché; Chester H. Opal, Country Public Affairs Officer; Lieutenant Colonel John J. Haley, Assistant Army Attaché; Darrell M. Price, Deputy Public Affairs Officer; <persName corresp="#p_BTD1">Thomas D. Bowie</persName>, Counselor for Political Affairs. Lieutenant Colonel White and Major Gildersleeve were members of the Military Assistance Advisory Group.</note></p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> discussed the various reports concerning the operations and administration of the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> which had been received from . . . <gloss target="#t_MSU1">MSU</gloss>, pointing out that it appeared the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> was badly infiltrated with Viet Cong agents, that it had no real training in police work, anti-subversion operations, political warfare or military training, and that pay was not uniform throughout the Corps; <pb xml:id="pg_857" n="857" facs="0887"/>there was no real screening of personnel inducted into the Corps, and that they had no equipment worthy of the name. He went on to say that the lack of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> reports from the Southwestern area of Viet Nam seemed most ominous to him, and indicated that the <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> were trying to hide something from the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Advisors.</p>
<p>Major Gildersleeve discussed a written report submitted by the 5th Region advisor, and an oral report made by the 11th Division advisor, pointing out specifically that there was no indication of Viet Cong infiltration in either of these reports from the Southwestern area.</p>
<p>Colonel Muir explained that training of <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> was about to be taken over by the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>, in accordance with an agreement between [name deleted] and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName>, and that <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> had prepared a training program for <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> that would be sent to <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> shortly.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName>, 10 days before, had told him that training of the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> would be done by the Civil Guard, and not by the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>. Colonel Muir explained that <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> had confirmed only three days before that <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> would conduct training for <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>, and that <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> was awaiting the training program from <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Barrows</persName> said in his opinion the new letter from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName> on the subject of the Civil Guard changed the whole picture, and that an attempt should be made to find out where a solution of the Civil Guard program would take us before any decision was made on <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>. It might be determined that it would be better to spend funds, which might otherwise go to the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>, on improving the Civil Guard, or on some other project.</p>
<p>Major Gildersleeve quoted from the guidance provided by the Operations Coordination [<hi rend="italic">Coordinating</hi>] Board of the National Security Council dated April 1957,<note n="3" xml:id="d403fn3">“Outline Plan of Operations with Respect to Vietnam,” April 12, not printed. (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> Files: Lot 62 D 430, Vietnam)</note> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Barrows</persName> explained that the guidance from <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> had been based on reports from Viet Nam, and in his opinion the situation had changed.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> asked supposing funds were not provided for the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>, were there any other projects that might be undertaken with the money that was so saved. Colonel Muir explained that the Budget Advisory Committee, in considering the budget, had approached each request on its own merit, actually including one project not requested by the Vietnamese (the formation of animal pack units) because it was felt that it was a requirement. In view of the fact that each request had been considered entirely on its own merit, there did not appear to be any areas where more money could be logically applied in the event funds were refused for <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_858" n="858" facs="0888"/>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> reiterated his concern about the apparently poor administration and questionable operations of the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>, and agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Barrows</persName> that the letter concerning the future of the Civil Guard<note n="4" xml:id="d403fn4">See <ref target="#d399fn3">footnote 3, Document 399</ref>.</note> would have many implications affecting the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>. He asked <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> if he wished to join him in a discussion with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName> on this letter, and <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> pointed out that [name deleted] should also be present in order to clarify the matter of training for the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>. He also explained that he did not want to have any discussion until he had had time to study the proposals in the letter and have his staff comment on them. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> said he had thought that clarification of the obvious loop holes in the letter might make staff consideration of the letter simpler, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Barrows</persName> agreed. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> said he would arrange for a meeting with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName> on Tuesday or Wednesday, 12 or 13 November.<note n="5" xml:id="d403fn5">A meeting between <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName> took place November 7. See <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.</note></p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Barrows</persName> stated that he had not yet heard any evidence that had led him to believe that the U.S. should not support a 30,000 <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>, despite the reports from <gloss target="#t_MSU1">MSU</gloss> . . . , nor had he heard any conclusive evidence that the U.S. should instead support 43,500. He suggested that approval of the budget to support a <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> of 30,000 would solve the immediate problem of the budget. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWC1">Haraldson</persName> suggested that the entire military budget for the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> might as well be supported by the United States, since the U.S. would directly or indirectly be supporting the Vietnamese contribution to the budget in any case. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> expressed concern at the fact that the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> had been in being for two years, and that we had poured money into it for two years, and that still it was not working, and appeared to be infiltrated with Viet Cong. Colonel Muir objected that it was working very well except in the South and that it was unfair to state that the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> was not working and was no good. Major Gildersleeve pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> was working very well in sensitive areas of Quang Tri, Hue and Tourane. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Barrows</persName> said he thought this was because the villages in this areas were good villages, rather than because the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> was particularly good. Lt Col White reviewed the basic ideas which had been behind the formation of the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>, pointing out that it had been intended that the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> be a static force in the villages, while the Civil Guard should provide a mobile force to assist in pacification operations. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> asked if Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> desired to cut out all funds for the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>, and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> said no, but that he thought some caveat should be applied to the expenditure of funds which might be made available for the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_859" n="859" facs="0889"/>
<p>A general discussion followed concerning the controls which might be placed on funds made available through <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, and it was agreed that controls should be established that would permit <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> to withhold funds even though they had been approved in the budget.</p>
<p>After considerable additional discussion along the same general lines as the above, considering the pros and cons of support for the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>, it was agreed that:</p>
<list>
<item>(1) The budget presented by <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> to the Country Team would be approved, with a specific caveat concerning the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>, stating that funds would not be released for the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> until the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has agreed to certain improvements and clarifications in the administration and overall operations of the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>.</item>
<item>(2) Needed clarifications and improvements in the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> would be discussed with representatives of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, and it would be explained to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> that funds would not be released until the Country Team was satisfied that improvement could and would be made. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> would discuss these matters with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName>, and thought it might prove desirable for him and <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> to discuss them also with the President at a later date.</item>
<item>(3) The decision as to the amount of funds to be applied to the support of <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> should be reached, if possible, before 1 January 1958 by the Country Term [<hi rend="italic">Team</hi>].</item>
<item>(4) If possible, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> should assume the additional duty of checking on the performance of the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> pointed out that this may not be feasible, and that it would require study on the part of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> before he could agree to it.</item>
<item>(5) <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> would continue check on the status and performance of the Civil Guard pending clarification.</item>

<item>(7) The caveats to be presented to the Vietnamese Government would be developed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BTD1">Bowie</persName>, assisted by Colonel Muir. In this connection, <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> pointed out that the only caveats he required were those submitted in paragraph 6 of <gloss target="#t_MAGCH1">MAGCH</gloss> 6540;<note n="6" xml:id="d403fn6"><p>In this telegram of October 8 (081001Z) <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName> had given <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> his “military evaluation of <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> and overall requirement justified for US support.” The <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Chief noted that since the combined efforts of the Army, the Civil Guard, and the Self-Defense Corps had brought about a long-range improvement in the internal security situation, it was hard to isolate the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>’s contribution, but that it had “contributed substantially to the cause of the Vietnamese Government by serving as a deterrent to communist and rebel activity in areas not protected by other police, para-military or military units and by assuming in conjunction with the civil guard security missions in remote areas which previously had been responsibility of the Army.” After a description of the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>’s command structure and its training, <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName> concluded:</p>
<p>“<gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> units should be located in villages and towns along the Laos–Vietnam and Cambodian-Vietnam borders, in other remote villages along possible avenues of approach in pacified but still vulnerable areas which are not protected by other static units. Units should be provided only for villages with population of 5000 or less. Size of units should vary, dependent on village. population, remoteness from other security forces and security requirements. After relating these factors to the total number of villages of under 5000 population in Vietnam, this <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> concludes that 43,500 <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> personnel will meet the minimum military requirements for static <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> units in villages. US support for not less than 43,500 <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> personnel is recommended for <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1958.</p>
<p>“The <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> still holds promise of giving a big return for a relatively small investment. Properly deployed and trained <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> units will not only give villagers assurance of governmental protection but will add materially to the development of both short and long range military capabilities. Realization of the full potential of the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> requires that the organization be divorced completely from the Civil Guard, that training be standardized, improved and modelled along para-military lines, and that missions and dispositions be reoriented toward the original static concept. <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> efforts are directed toward accomplishment of these improvements.” (Center of Military History, <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName> Papers, <gloss target="#t_TWXS1">TWXs</gloss> 1957 (14)</p></note> and <pb xml:id="pg_860" n="860" facs="0890"/>that since the exceptions taken to the proposed budget support had been voiced by the Ambassador, <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_MSU1">MSU</gloss>, he wished the caveats based on their concern to be prepared by them.</item>

<p>Subsequent to the meeting Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BTD1">Bowie</persName>, Colonel Muir, and finally the Ambassador agreed that the following paragraph should be included in a covering letter, which should become an integral part of the budget.</p>

<p>My Dear <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Felix</persName>: This is in reply to yours of 24 October<note n="2" xml:id="d405fn2">In this letter to <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Stump</persName> had asked the Chief of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> to expand on the remarks concerning personal relationships between Vietnamese and U.S. officials made in <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName>’ letter to <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Stump</persName> of October 18. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> Conversations with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> 16 Sep 57–28 Dec 57) For the letter of October 18, see <ref target="#d400">Document 400</ref>.</note> relating to “<hi rend="italic">declining cordiality</hi>.” I’ve been delayed in writing this letter due to influx of visitors, press of business, and my absence from Saigon at Division maneuvers in the Tourane area.</p>
<p>When I speak of <hi rend="italic">declining cordiality</hi> I refer to frame of mind of Americans as well as Vietnamese. It is my considered opinion, based on intangibles as contrast to positive proof, that relationships between official American groups in Vietnam have <hi rend="italic">deteriorated</hi> during past few months. This opinion is based on the one hand by remarks that have been made in private to me by certain <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> General Officers; Mr. Thuan and [name deleted], <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>; and in facial expressions frequently used by the President in private conversations, as contrast to his exact words and on the other hand by statements made by Americans in official meetings. These remarks normally are such as to indicate a high degree of dissatisfaction with results of their business meetings with members of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. If their conversations are such as they report it can only be assumed that they hold their counterparts in very low regard and the conversations with them definitely less than cordial. Such remarks as stated in my presence could only be considered by the <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> as belittling and consequently keenly resented. However, I have not noted particularly any strained relations at social or semi-social gatherings.</p>
<p>It has been some time since I’ve heard any thought or plan put forward by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> that was not severely questioned or actually scathingly attacked. For some time I questioned this procedure and the tone used to describe <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> proposals and have attempted to explain in more moderate language what I believed the <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> had in mind. This to little or no avail. We have been cautioned that “localitis is the greatest crime in diplomatic field.” This is not too difficult to understand and certainly should be guarded against in diplomatic field or any other. <hi rend="italic">Currently “the thing to do” is to belittle and question</hi>. However, I resent a friend of mine being referred to as a SOB (“he is our son-of-a-bitch so we have to put up with him”) or official communications being referred to as “a lot of bull-shit.” If persons must, they can be <pb xml:id="pg_863" n="863" facs="0893"/>profane without being vulgar, particularly before a captive audience. Vulgarity is distasteful to me and I do not allow it in my presence among Military under my Command.</p>
<p>As to what you can do, nothing. I’ll continue to do the best I can here on the spot.</p>
<p>The <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> do not like to be threatened, talked down to, nor pushed around. Furthermore it is not necessary. They can be influenced to do as we wish by showing sympathetic understanding of their particular problems, close friendly liaison and suggestions or recommendations made, sometimes many times over, in a straight forward man to man way.</p>
<p>I write you of this trend in the strictest confidence and for your eyes alone.<note n="3" xml:id="d405fn3">In a letter to <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Stump</persName> of December 7 <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName> detailed a number of incidents which he believed might indicate “the beginning of a change for the bettering of relations between the American and the Vietnamese official groups.” In several of these incidents <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName> depicted Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> urging or ordering restraint in the behavior of members of the Mission.

Ref <gloss target="#t_Toica1">Toica</gloss> 584,<note n="2" xml:id="d406fn2">See <ref target="#d402fn2">footnote 2, Document 402</ref>.</note> <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 902.<note n="3" xml:id="d406fn3"><ref target="#d402">Document 402</ref>.</note></p>
<p>1. Dept. and <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> have reviewed <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 proposed Defense Support aid level of $175 million in light of comparative need of claimants against curtailed appropriations, considering pipelines and availability local resources, and believe this figure provides Viet-Nam equitable allocation on such basis. Vietnamese arguments against more than prorated global cutback 20 percent and for maintenance of aid level suggested <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>s not convincing since they preclude consideration need. This connection such global Defense Support cutback <pb xml:id="pg_864" n="864" facs="0894"/>from amounts requested (excluding Spain whose level was fixed by Congress) is actually over 21 percent.</p>
<p>2. Prior to determination Viet-Nam <gloss target="#t_DS1">DS</gloss> aid level careful consideration was given to increasing it to $185 million from meager global reserves. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss> if strong case can be made later this fiscal year, however, possibility increase not precluded. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. While we fully recognize difficulty involved in gaining ready acceptance by Vietnamese of more than pro rata cuts Dept does not consider that <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>s make strong enough case to justify increase at this time on political grounds.</p>
<p>3. Pertinent to lower aid level is availability Development Loan Fund financing for which it hoped Viet-Nam can qualify by early presentation satisfactory projects. Also PL 480 if approved should provide additional assistance. Another relevant factor is proposed currency devaluation which if agreed upon soon enough might make <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 aid level more adequately cover local currency budget support and other requirements.</p>
<p>4. We appreciate points in <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> but you will understand that our three biggest programs—Korea, Viet-Nam and Taiwan—are all in countries which are staunch friends of free world and since cut must be absorbed unfortunately these programs must bear their share.</p>
<p>5. Vietnamese last week presented “talking papers”<note n="4" xml:id="d406fn4">None printed.</note> being pouched which sought (1) at least maintenance of 1957 levels of military aid (2) aid for Self Defense Corps of 60,000 (3) annual economic aid of $100 million. In responding to these and other overtures to maintain or increase aid levels it would seem timely for Embassy and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> to endeavor again impress on <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> necessity of considering totality of <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> resources including foreign aid in relation to total requirements rather than presenting series of additive aid requests to US. Point should be made that such approach should help protect value <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> currency by curtailing budget deficit and other sources inflation and at same time provide basis for rational approach to Viet-Nam’s sustained economic growth and eventual economic independence.</p>

He made strong point with Hardy Committee<note n="3" xml:id="d407fn3">Reference is to the Subcommittee on International Operations, chaired by Porter Hardy, Jr. (D.–Va.). The subcommittee was part of the House Committee on Government Operations.</note> he had to have military-security forces built up because of growing Communist threat. He has continued to stress with me need for more but not too expensive roads for both strategic and economic reasons. With Communists in Lao govt he even more concerned about his security problem and fact he may be isolated as only fully free-world oriented govt this part of world.</p>
<p>He adds he has been carrying anti-Communist torch on various visits particularly in India where he also gave good plug for need for and defensive aspect of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. He is using his revival Asian cultures theme as effective argument against materialistic atheism of Communism (which has considerable merit, in my opinion). Therefore he argues why is United States planning cut aid to <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> same proportion as others and planning give loan to neutralist India. He points out neutralist countries will not think of changing their policies if it becomes clear that countries like <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> which are tied to West do not get preferred treatment. I have argued not too successfully that with our curtailed resources we in his interests as well as ours, try help all countries not behind Curtain to maintain independence.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is so preoccupied with military security problem due to increased internal subversion and Communist gains in nearby countries he shows little interest in basic economic development for moment. Therefore with substantial aid cut there will be little chance to induce him devote more resources to economic sector till he is assured sufficient funds maintain and build up military-security posture.</p>
<p>Since he is in this frame of mind I will endeavor to explain to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, before <persName corresp="#p_HWC1">Haraldson</persName> leaves (<gloss target="#t_ETD1">ETD</gloss> December 1) total aid picture along following lines.</p>

<item>2. New technical assistance money $4,200,000.</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_866" n="866" facs="0896"/>
<item>3. We will also make available about 5 to 6 million dollars from previously unprogrammed pipeline funds—which makes an assured total of about $185,000,000.</item>
<item>4. Will tell him it may be possible to meet their request for $5,000,000 to $6,000,000 PL 480 money for tobacco (if this is to be approved as we understand, should appreciate firm instructions if possible by Nov 27 so we can proceed with negotiations).</item>
<item>5. Explain to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> possibilities of development loan fund for such self-liquidating projects as Saigon thermal plant, Saigon water supply, Nong Son coal mine, etc., which if fully justified and approved could bring in 10–15 million dollars additional aid, making possible total figure close to $200,000,000.</item>
<item>6. Assure him through <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> that <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> approved military budget will permit <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to carry on its military build up and training at same pace as last year.</item>
<item>7. Tell him we approve contribution for 43,500 Self Defense Corps. (This figure worked out by <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> on basis study of needs to cover villages in sensitive areas not covered by other forces and funds are provided for this number in <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> approved military budget—see <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> message to <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss> <gloss target="#t_DTG1">DTG</gloss> 162305Z subject: Vietnam Self Defense Corps.<note n="4" xml:id="d407fn4">See <ref target="#d403fn7">footnote 7, Document 403</ref>.</note>) This approval given on basis specific steps he must take to strengthen organizational, training and screening methods for <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>.</item>
<item>8. Explain global demands on reduced aid appropriations and underline necessity consider totality <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> resources rather than presentation of series of additive aid requests.</item>
<item>9.

<p>He will probably react rather strongly by pleading his “special” case and his full Western orientation, but I hope by presenting picture in this way we can convince him we are giving him special treatment as a staunch ally.</p>

Pleaded during frank but friendly discussion his “special case” because deteriorating situation this part of the world and need to move forward as fast as possible in next few years to build up security and economic base. He, <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName> and other experts stated would not be possible <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> provide as much as $41.6 million from own resources as contribution to military budget.<note n="5" xml:id="d408fn5">According to telegram 1124 from Saigon, the final Vietnamese military budget was $171.6 million of which the United States would carry $130 and Vietnam $41.6 million. This left a balance of $55 million from U.S. aid for development purposes.</note> Emphasized national budget already presented to Assembly and being worked on now only provided for $20 million <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> contribution to the military budget, and that they had told us categorically in September mtg aid comite would be impossible contribute $37 million equivalent then proposed. If we insisted more than double contribution entire national budget would have to be reworked by the Assembly which they alleged would have very serious pol repercussions by giving impression to Deputies and people that government devoting too large amount to military instead of doing more for people and if it should be necessary at this date rework budget in Assembly inference would be drawn that this forced upon <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> by US. We argued our calculations indicated revenue from imports would be considerably higher than anticipated and <pb xml:id="pg_868" n="868" facs="0898"/>this excess in all probability would be sufficient to cover additional <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> contribution to military budget. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> argued while it might appear revenues higher than anticipated much of this comes from effort he making collect back taxes which gives only temporary increase and that with reduced imports through end this year, revenues would be lower. We replied if revenues not as high as we believe some addit revenue cld be derived from addit taxes on certain types semi-luxury articles whose prices here lower than world prices under present tax system. They replied, not possible raise taxes since entire business community now pleading present taxes causing deflationary movement and business stagnation and new taxes on these few semi-luxury articles would only cover very small portion of suggested <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> contribution. Altho Chau and <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> reiterated they were sure that receipts wld not be as high as we anticipated, they nevertheless agreed to study this question fully with <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> experts. We then argued that if receipts were not as high as we expected, it wld be necessary reduce economic aid proportionately to make up full difference for mil budget. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Gen Williams</persName> assured <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> proposed mil budget is realistic and will permit <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> carry on its mil buildup and training at same pace as last year. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> seemed satisfied with this assurance but obviously disappointed by small amount residue econ aid available. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and others, despite their belief that our procedures are too rigid and too slow, promised to work more closely with <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> experts in order work up careful justification for various econ projects. We stated it absolutely essential <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> show need for all econ assistance and take into consideration totality <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> resources. <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName> pointed out draw-down of pipeline is not really new aid and that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> hoped they cld draw-down much more from pipeline in 1958.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> asked me to call again this morning. In very calm and friendly but firm manner, he expressed his deep concern over the consequences of the reductions explained yesterday. Again he pled that it wld be most difficult, if not impossible, for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to contribute large amount suggested for mil budget. He reiterated that if small amount econ aid ($55 million) had to be further reduced to make up the balance for the mil budget, people wld get impression US only interested in mil posture Vietnam which he admitted he himself insisted upon, and people wld get impression that at this critical time when Commie subversion and Commie econ aid programs are being stepped up, that the US not interested in building up <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> econ strength. He again referred as he had Nov 27 [<hi rend="italic">29?</hi>] to possibility masses might begin clamoring for neutralist policy which wld permit reduction of mil forces in order to build up economy. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> pointed out he, of course, could not accept such an attitude because of Commie strength in the north, which requires, in Vietnam as well as <pb xml:id="pg_869" n="869" facs="0899"/>US interests, <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> be as strong as possible. Nevertheless, he fears it will be difficult to deal with this feeling in the masses. In his quiet, chastened mood, he urged me to explain again the pol aspects of his problem to Washington in the hope that further assistance can be given to Vietnam. I told him that it is still possible to obtain addit aid under development loan fund provided his experts can work closely with <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and develop worthwhile fully justified projects. He replied this wld take much time and adverse reaction to the basic aid figure wld not be compensated for by later announcements of few projects under loan fund.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> said he was disappointed <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName> had not been more successful in inducing Dept to increase aid. I told him matters of this kind must of necessity be worked out in field where experts on both sides are present.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Comments</hi>: As matters now stand, it was tacitly agreed national aid comite (including <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>) wld discuss and study problem of available aid resources as between mil defense support and projects for technical and econ assistance program. This will involve <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> making decision whether it can arrange, through their budget, to make the contribution to mil budget we recommended (<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHC1">Chau</persName> emphasized this politically and financially not possible) or accept a further reduction in econ program to make up difference in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> contribution. When this exercise is over, we may expect <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to make further plea on pol importance make it clear to <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> people, neutralists and Commies that those who work closely with Free World fare better than those that do not. In touching on this note today, he asked if aid to Cambodia for instance is being cut as much as <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>. I told him I did not know, but was certain <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> getting preferred treatment.</p>

<p>After returning with President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> from his successful visit to the United States, during which he received well deserved praise for the “miracle” he had achieved in a fairly short time against great odds, I began to notice certain developments which in my opinion give grounds for considerable concern. Last Spring it had been hoped that the year 1957 in Viet Nam would be one of progress on a broader front than that of security and survival.</p>
<p>As the year wore on more signs appeared indicating a slowing down of momentum and a reluctance to take the obviously necessary decisions. It had been expected that with additional economic aid available for fiscal year 1957 the Government would move ahead at a fair pace to build up a more solid economic and social base. Little was accomplished in this field. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> made it clear in the late summer that he was again primarily concerned with security matters. This concern, as we have reported, was due in part to increased terrorist acts, undoubtedly encouraged if not perpetrated by communists. Our concern was increased by more and more reports and rumors of adverse developments on other fronts. Nevertheless it was difficult to understand why he continued to delay taking certain steps we strongly urged and which he had the means to accomplish. We also began hearing more and more grumblings and expressions of discontent, which seemed to indicate that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> was not increasing his prestige and appeal to the country.</p>
<p>These indications reached sufficient proportions to warrant, in my opinion, careful study and analysis. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> himself has indirectly pointed out these problems, by stating to me and others on several occasions that while everyone in the United States seems to believe that he has performed a miracle in the past three years, they also seem to feel that all of Viet Nam’s basic problems have been solved. He has pled with me to try to correct this erroneous impression since there are many problems ahead which may be more difficult than those in the past. It was for these reasons that I suggested to the Country Team that we work up a critical and I hope objective evaluation of the situation in Viet Nam today.</p>
<p>The attached paper is the result. While more emphasis is given to the unsolved problems, in an attempt to take the pulse of the country at this time, the paper should not be interpreted to mean that everything is coming apart and nothing constructive can be done. The basic thought I had in mind in asking for this analysis is that it is better to take a rather cold blooded look at the situation <pb xml:id="pg_871" n="871" facs="0901"/>here in order better to know and foresee the problems ahead than to hope for the best based on past performance.</p>
<p>Since the first draft was written several weeks ago increasing evidence has come to hand which seems to point to a concerted, stepped-up communist campaign to try to throw the regime off balance by terrorism and intimidation. Nevertheless, it is the consensus of most of the Country Team that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would be in a better position to bolster security if he paid more attention to questions other than security matters. If he takes some of the steps within his power to take, he should be able to increase his prestige and make a larger segment of the population loyal to him and his regime. By not doing this, he seems to be risking unpopularity with the people, which may play into communist hands. It is for these reasons that we recommend in the paper that we continue to press him to take what appear to us to be necessary steps for the good of his regime.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the frank discussions we had with him in connection with the aid levels of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958, in which we urged him to work closer with us in getting several economic projects started, will cause him to move forward on the economic front.</p>
<p>While the other members of the Country Team concur in the substance and conclusions of the attached paper. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName>, Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, does not subscribe to the inference in the paper as he reads it that President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is failing in his task or is on his way to failure. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> believes that the present military posture of Viet Nam is not too strong and that any weakening in that field would jeopardize the mission of the Armed Forces. For this reason he does not believe that President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> should be re-oriented from his present military policy. While I agree, as made clear in the paper, that under present circumstances we cannot reduce the military costs, I believe <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> can, with the resources at his disposal, move ahead simultaneously on other fronts. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> has been in Viet Nam for over two years, knows President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> well and has his confidence. Furthermore <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> and his fellow officers work very closely and harmoniously with the members of the Vietnamese Armed Forces and have confidence in them. Therefore, the attached paper should be read with the firm opinion of <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> in mind.</p>
<p>In other words, the paper has been prepared to invite comment and criticism in the hope that all may arrive at a clearer understanding of the situation in Viet Nam and the problems ahead.<note n="3" xml:id="d409fn3">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCG1">Chapman</persName> prepared the initial draft of the paper and stayed with it until its completion.

<p>EVALUATION OF SITUATION IN VIET NAM: DECEMBER 1957</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary</p>
<p>Certain problems now discernible have given us a warning which, if disregarded, might lead to a deteriorating situation in Viet Nam within a few years.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> achieved notable successes in the first two years of his regime and remains the only man of stature so far in evidence to guide this country. He has unified free Viet Nam, brought it relative security and stability, and firmly maintains a pro-West, anti-communist position.</p>
<p>In the last year, however. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has avoided making decisions required to build the economic and social foundations necessary to secure Viet Nam’s future independence and strength. He has made it clear that he would give first priority to the build-up of his armed forces regardless of the country’s requirements for economic and social development. Events abroad which increase the danger of communist infiltration and subversion, and which threaten Viet Nam with possible isolation in this area have contributed to his concern and to his determination to strengthen his armed forces.</p>
<p>Certain characteristics of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>—his suspiciousness and authoritarianism—have also reduced the Government’s limited administrative capabilities. He assumes responsibility for the smallest details of Government and grants his Ministers little real authority.</p>
<p>At the same time, discontent is felt in different segments of the population for varied reasons. The base of the regime’s popular support <pb xml:id="pg_873" n="873" facs="0903"/>remains narrow. The regime might overcome such discontent and finally win over the loyalty of a majority of Vietnamese both in the North and South if it could show its ability to give the country stronger protection and create sound economic and social bases for progress. Progress, which is demanded in Viet Nam as throughout Asia, is perhaps the touchstone of the regime’s enduring viability. Yet precisely because <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is now procrastinating in making decisions affecting fundamental problems of his country’s development, the lag between the people’s expectations and the Government’s ability to show results will grow.</p>
<p>We consider it therefore of importance that we bring strong pressure on the President to reach certain decisions basically in the economic and social fields which have been before him for some months but on which he has not acted. He has resented this and may resent it more, but in ours and his long range interests we must do our utmost to cause him to move forward in these fields.</p>
<p>The purpose of this evaluation of the present situation in Viet Nam is to examine the elements giving rise to some concern regarding certain developments in Viet Nam, to provide the Department and interested agencies salient background and to set forth conclusions and recommend certain broad courses of action. We feel that a frank discussion of the solution as we see it may be helpful to all concerned.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Elements of Strength</p>
<p>Although this despatch emphasizes our concern regarding certain trends, we should set forth the existing elements of undoubted strength in the situation in Viet Nam, in order to give this presentation proper balance. These are outlined below.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> remains the unqualified leader of Viet Nam and the only man of stature so far in evidence to preside over his country’s destiny. He is a man of unimpeachable honesty and real courage. None of the so-called opposition leaders, such as Dr. Phan Quang Dan of the Democratic Bloc, have yet proven to have the quality of statesmen. Neither is there another strong personality now discernible in the Government or among the senior officers of the Armed Forces. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> furthermore has undoubtedly led South Viet Nam, with considerable economic aid and political support from the U.S., to a unity that few observers could have expected in the bleak days of July 1954. He has given the country a much needed stability—an essential condition for any future development—which has already permitted the repairing of much of the physical destruction of the period of military operations and a return to more nearly normal peace-time activities.</p>
<p>With the support and guidance of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, the army has made great progress. It was the instrument that permitted <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to pacify <pb xml:id="pg_874" n="874" facs="0904"/>the country and is now considered able to fulfill the mission of maintaining internal security. It has also reached a degree of combat-worthiness which provides a certain deterrent to external aggression. This force insures the stability of the regime and thus provides a basic condition for Viet Nam’s economic and social development.</p>
<p>During the past year Viet Nam has made commendable progress in improving its public finances. An Executive budget was prepared for presentation to an extraordinary meeting of the National Assembly. After a study by appropriate committees of the Assembly and debate it was voted, along with a substantial increase in taxes recommended by the Ministry of Finance on the advice of <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>. Administration of the budget was also improved, with the result that certain hidden deficits arising during 1955 and 1956 from expenditures of provincial and regional authorities were eliminated. Throughout this year Government revenues have exceeded expenditures. During the same period payments into the counterpart fund exceeded counterpart disbursements. These are the principal sources of the deflation which has replaced inflation in the Vietnamese economy during the past year. In the face of the fact that throughout the world, not excluding many other countries which benefit substantially from American aid, inflation remains a threat to political stability and an obstacle to economic development, eliminating inflation in Viet Nam during the past year has been no small accomplishment.</p>
<p>Finally, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> is committed to an anti-communist policy and recognizes that he owes his survival to the free world with which he wishes to remain associated. His position on this subject has been shown in various ways. In the last two months, for instance, he has undertaken to call publicly on his fellow Asians to revive their ancient cultures and to combat the imported atheistic materialist teachings of communism. He has made this a central theme of his speeches both domestically and abroad—in Thailand, in Korea and in India. Thus, South Viet Nam is one Asian country that has clearly staked its future to an anti-communist, pro-West policy.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Our First Concern</p>
<p>However, after attaining notable, if not miraculous, successes in the political and internal security fields during the first two years of his regime, he has, for all practical purposes, lost much of the past year by failing to decide on steps he should take to build up the economic foundations of his country. In the last few weeks he has stated quite categorically that the building of these foundations is definitely secondary to the further build-up of strong and effective security and military forces and to the successful establishment of settlements of loyal citizens near the Cambodian frontier and in the High Plateau. This decision shows, in our opinion, a lack of full perception <pb xml:id="pg_875" n="875" facs="0905"/>of the inter-relationship between military security and economic progress in safeguarding this country’s long range future. It is this lack of understanding and the somewhat distorted approach that results from it, that arouses our primary concern.</p>
<p>The possibility of substantial reductions of U.S. aid in the future has also caused <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to hesitate further to take steps outside the purely security field. It may also cause him to take decisions whose wisdom we doubt, or which may not be in our best interests. We believe that a decision to allocate aid and other revenue to military forces without taking into account, at this particular juncture in Viet Nam’s development, the requirements of long-range economic progress would be ignoring the need to counteract present sources of discontent and meet future internal stresses of the regime.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">President’s Shortcomings</p>
<p>The Government’s administrative incapacity adds to the difficulties we have in carrying forward our programs. Administrative incapacity, while natural in a new country, is in part a consequence of the President’s character. He overrides most of his Ministers, reduces their authority and assumes personal responsibility for the smallest details of government. He is inclined to be suspicious of others; he lacks an understanding of basic economic principles; and seems absorbed in pet ideas and schemes which detract from work on other urgent questions. For example, he has become absorbed, with considerable reason, with Viet Minh infiltration across his frontier with Cambodia and Laos. He believes this problem can be solved basically by the creation of settlements in the frontier areas and the construction of roads particularly in the highlands. Meanwhile, there are left pending such fundamental questions as seeing through the program of agrarian reform, laying the foundations for industrial development, monetary reform, building up an administrative and technical base needed if only to implement our aid programs.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has not won too much enthusiasm or whole-hearted backing of his people. He is admired and respected for his honesty of purposes and devotion to the national cause, but criticized for what many consider to be his lack of understanding of the country’s aspirations. While he honestly advocates democracy and probably equally honestly considers himself a democrat, basically he remains a mandarin with the autocratic attitude of “I know best,” a good trait at the present stage of development of a new country, provided it does not lead to a sterilizing inflexibility. This characteristic, together with his family’s unpopularity and his Ministers’ awe of him, has brought him to a growing solitude, where many problems become theoretical and lose to a certain extent their practical realities.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_876" n="876" facs="0906"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s personal shortcomings outside the politico-military field were obvious during the earlier phase of this government’s existence. Now, however, they constitute a particular barrier to further sound development and hamper day-to-day working relationships with Vietnamese officials. This factor must be taken into account in planning our activities here and assessing their effectiveness.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Complications Abroad</p>
<p>While <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> hesitates and delays on these internal problems, disturbing events abroad cause him, with reason, additional concern. Events in each of the countries of Laos, Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Burma, all contribute to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s concern.</p>
<p>The events in Thailand in particular may also affect the attitudes of many thinking Vietnamese. From here it appears that the elections of December may well bring about an Assembly and perhaps a Government in which left wingers carry a large influence. Such a development might eventually lead the Thai Government to reconsider its formerly close links with the U.S. and adopt policies more favorable to Communist China. If Thailand adopted a softer policy toward communism and Laos comes under effective Pathet Lao control, and while Malaya’s position remains undefined, Viet Nam would be left as possibly the only firm pro-West anti-communist nation on Mainland <gloss>SEA</gloss>. The realization by thinking people in this country of being in such an exposed position may well tend to strengthen much of the existing discontent in Viet Nam. As indicated above, recent developments in Laos have also added to the apprehensions of Vietnamese Government officials, who fear stepped-up communist activities along the entire western border and a more or less complete isolation of Viet Nam in this part of the world.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Sources of Discontent</p>
<p>There is as yet no serious reason for concern for the stability of the regime. However, there is a growing underlying discontent. It exists in various groups and arises from several causes. The principal sources of discontent appear to be: an original economic and social dislocation ensuing from war and the problems brought about by the assumption of independence; failure to fulfill the sometimes unrealistic demand for progress; persistent and increasing lack of security in many areas over the past six months, particularly in the South and Southwest; a lack of vitality in the political parties; <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s resentment at even mild opposition; the regime’s rigidity and certain lack of tolerance which alienates a large proportion of the intellectuals; and the ineffective bureaucracy, which has dampened enthusiasm for the regime, particularly among the youth.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_877" n="877" facs="0907"/>
<p>Finally, from time to time there are manifestations of some resentment, as must inevitably arise, that Viet Nam is so completely dependent on foreign aid. While most of these sources of discontent are all inherent in any new regime taking over from repressive colonialism, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> appears to ignore them a bit too readily for the long-range growth of this country.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Political Parties</p>
<p>The President speaks freely of carrying out a revolution in Viet Nam by which he means a basic reshaping of institutions and traditions to create a democratic, nationalist society which will guard the individual’s dignity and rights as its highest values. Earlier in his march toward power, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> created political and other organisms to carry out this “revolution,” i.e., the National Revolutionary Movement, the League of Revolutionary Civil Servants, etc. However, since approximately October 1956, when the constitution was proclaimed, the President and those around him have apparently lost interest in these mechanisms which they have allowed to drift into the hands of second-rate leaders and which have consequently lost much of their original appeal. In the meantime, through the semi-covert Workers’ Party and other instruments directed largely by the President’s brother and political advisor, <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName>, almost all political, social welfare, journalistic, cultural, and other public activities have been brought under substantial control of a covert nature.<note n="4" xml:id="d409fn4"><p>The reference is to the Can Lao Nhan Yi Dang and affiliated parties organized on a secret basis throughout the civil and military services in Vietnam. The party was formed in 1953 under a different name by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s brother, <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName>, and five other Vietnamese political thinkers. It soon came increasingly under the control of <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>. According to his memoirs, <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName> opposed the methods and purpose of the party and told <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> so. <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName> argued that a clandestine political organization controlled by <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> and with its own secret police would force legitimate nationalist parties underground. <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName> took his concerns to then Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> who informed him that a U.S. policy decision had been made to assist in building the Can Lao party. <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName> returned to Washington, according to his memoirs, to argue his case, and had a private session there with <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">John Foster</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> in early 1956. <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName> was not successful. During his remaining year in Vietnam, <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName> attempted to persuade <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> of the necessity for a free and loyal opposition, but his efforts, he states, were in vain. See <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName>, <hi rend="italic">In the Midst of Wars</hi>, pp. 339–345.</p>
<p>In a memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName> to the Secretary of Defense, undated, in which he reported on a trip he had made to Vietnam in January 1961, <persName corresp="#p_LCEG1">Lansdale</persName> recounted that <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> “seemed genuinely surprised” when informed that the Can Lao party “was originally promoted by the U.S. State Department and was largely the brainchild of a highly respected senior Foreign Service professional.” See <hi rend="italic">United States–Vietnam Relations, 1945–1967</hi>, Book 11, p. 9.</p></note> Aside from the various religious organizations and such innocuous international groups as the Boy Scouts and the Red Cross, almost all public organizations and means of public expression in Viet Nam are <pb xml:id="pg_878" n="878" facs="0908"/>dominated or covertly manipulated by the regime. This fact is generally known to the educated public and generally resented.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Mr. and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName></p>
<p>As a result of this resentment and the gossip engendered by <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>’s covert activities, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> and his wife have been increasingly built up into legendary eminences grises to whom are attributed insatiable greed for power and wealth and unscrupulous connivance to achieve them. The larger part of these rumors is believed by the Embassy to be the product of overheated and resentful imaginations. However, this unhealthy situation contributes to the general disgruntlement, and together with the apparent lack of interest by the President in his own political parties, is perhaps responsible for a considerable part of the weakening of support for the regime among the so-called elite groups.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Narrow Base of Genuine Support</p>
<p>Reflecting the President’s own suspiciousness and somewhat narrow point of view, the regime employs generally only those whose support meets very restrictive and personal criteria of loyalty. Therefore, the services of many able persons are lost. Furthermore, many intellectuals, professionals and particularly those students remaining abroad, also are unwilling to serve the regime. Those who do take part in the work of the Government are frequently discontented and discouraged. Many high officials do little to hide their resentment of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s somewhat autocratic attitude. Part of the difficulty of these groups lies in the fact that in many instances there is little scope for their abilities outside the Government.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Business Community</p>
<p>The regime is also somewhat distrustful of the business community. There is a tendency to consider businessmen, in accordance with ancient Vietnamese social values, as belonging to one of the lower classes of society. Such an attitude in the Government hardly breeds confidence. Likewise, in general, the regime distrusts the foreigners’ influence on the economy. It has sought, for understandable reasons, to bring the Chinese community under its control and has generally discouraged French interests from investing in Viet Nam. Examples of the latter are found in specific cases, where construction of a glass factory, a sugar refinery and the expansion of certain rubber plantations were in question. The result has been a loss to the economy and the discouragement of forces which might have promoted its progress, without, in the meantime, being able to find other forces which could effectively take steps to make progress in the economic field.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_879" n="879" facs="0909"/>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Peasants</p>
<p>It is difficult to gauge the mood of the peasantry and dangerous to generalize in view of the wide difference between Central and South Viet Nam. Nevertheless, there undoubtedly remain areas, particularly in the West and South, where peasants still, basically through ignorance, fear or persuasion, support enemies of the central government. In these areas the Viet Minh were active during the war and created zones of insecurity where landlords could not go. Because the communists were the stronger, the peasants went along with them and because the landlords could not enforce their rights, the peasants ceased paying rents on their lands. Although the Government has succeeded in reestablishing its authority in most areas, there are certain areas which are out of reach and where Viet Minh agents and dissident elements can and do continue to carry on their activities. By habit and by a basic desire of being left in peace and avoiding trouble, the peasantry has generally not sought to oppose the rebel elements but have gone, or have been forced to go, along with them where the Government has not been clearly master. At the moment, however, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military forces are in the process of conducting a fairly large-scale anti-dissident sweep in the Delta region which may help to increase the standing and prestige of the Government in that area.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Control of Travel Abroad</p>
<p>The problem of travel abroad of Vietnamese illustrates the complications arising from <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s outlook. Viet Nam needs trained personnel. There are numerous Vietnamese abroad, mostly in France, who have completed their studies but who show great reluctance in returning to Viet Nam. This reluctance no doubt stems in part from the fact that a trained person can obtain greater economic advantages in the developed countries than in Viet Nam. There is also the fact that travel by Vietnamese out of Viet Nam is tightly controlled by the President himself. He has recently been most reluctant to permit many young Vietnamese civilians to go abroad to study, even with scholarships or training grants. (This does not apply to military personnel going to study in the U.S.) He fears that those who study in France, for example, will become contaminated by the communists or become French agents. This policy hinders the training of Vietnamese in fields not offered in this country. It also discourages Vietnamese abroad from returning to Viet Nam even for a visit, to see how things are going and perhaps settle here again, because they fear they will not be allowed the choice of leaving again. This is an example of the “stifling atmosphere” of which certain intellectuals in Viet Nam complain.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_880" n="880" facs="0910"/>
<p>Very recently, however, after considerable pressure from the Embassy, there appears to have been a certain relaxation in granting permission to go abroad, as <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has authorized the departure of a number of <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>-sponsored trainees.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Expression of Discontent</p>
<p>An indication of the educated classes’ discontent was the popularity of the opposition newspaper <hi rend="italic">Thoi Luan</hi>. It had no particular intrinsic merit, but it did criticize the Government, albeit carefully. And it was therefore read. One of the issues over which government and opposition tilted lances was the sentences imposed on the leaders of the Binh Xuyen sect. The word amnesty was not used; yet, this was the issue. Relatively improved internal security and consolidation of the authority of the regime have not resulted in any appreciable political reconciliation with non-communist opponents. Jails and camps are reportedly still filled with hundreds of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s opponents. It has come to my attention that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s personal advisors urged him to make a gesture in his Independence Day speech calling, in effect, for such a reconciliation and urging all disaffected groups to rally to the Government. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> did not take this advice.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Asia’s Stirring</p>
<p>Perhaps a more aggravating phenomenon than all these causes, is the stirring felt thoughout Viet Nam as throughout Asia—the demand of the people to make up for time lost and catch up with the West in material power and development. There will continue to be an inevitable lag between expectations and actual accomplishments which will serve to feed all other causes of discontent. This lag, furthermore, will be greater and more keenly felt if <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s administration continues to prove needlessly slow in making decisions which will enable the economy to develop and which will give the people a sense of progress.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Consequences of Discontent</p>
<p>The causes of discontent mentioned above are at work among important segments of people. Unless there is appreciable progress in the near future, the dissatisfaction may manifest itself by a growing disbelief that Western aid can solve Asian problems; greater opposition to the present regime; increased receptivity to blandishments from the North (about which <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> seems to be more and more sensitive); strengthening the belief, already held by some, in the myth of Asia for Asians (and within this myth the Chinese Communists are considered first of all Asians), and a consequent penchant toward neutralism despite the orientation of the regime itself. The President’s brother, <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>, stated recently that there is a growing desire for <pb xml:id="pg_881" n="881" facs="0911"/>neutralism among some intellectuals. They apparently believe that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> has counted too much on American aid and support, and fear it may be suddenly cut off in the not too distant future.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital"><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s Commitment to an Anti-Communist Policy</p>
<p>While growing discontent might bring demands from some intellectuals and other groups for dissociating Viet Nam from too close bonds with the West and for some accommodations with the communist world, I believe <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s regime would be unable to accommodate itself with such a trend, since he seems so firmly committed to anti-communism. He could be more Asiatic and less pro-West, but his position, we believe, is based on anti-communist policies. This means he has less flexibility for political maneuvering than most <gloss>SEA</gloss> countries. Such rigidity might further widen the gulf between the government and the people and create an unstable situation. This could conceivably in the long run cause his downfall.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital"><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s Reaction</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> realizes the existence of discontent although perhaps not the full extent or nature of it. While until recently he had given himself five years to achieve substantial results to satisfy the demand of his people for progress, he now considers that he must show some results within a more limited time. (He has mentioned a year and a half to three years.) He is worried about the reduction of American aid and the consequent limitations on the scope of his actions. He is seriously worried with considerable reason by the possibilities of Viet Minh infiltration through Laos and Cambodia and has plugged for full U.S. support of a 60,000-man Self-Defense Corps and at times of a 170,000-man Army, even to the detriment of creating a firmer economic base—(although in part this may have been a play to forestall too deep cuts in our 1958 aid program). He is worried concerning the possible failure of his settlements program in the High Plateau which he thought up himself and has pushed through in a fairly heavy-handed manner without much regard to the ability of his administrators or the resources at their disposal. (Such a failure would constitute a serious blow to his pride since it would be his first and would leave the problem of the security of the highlands unsolved.) He also feels under pressure from the Viet Minh, Indians, and even from segments of the population in South Viet Nam to expand within the next two years communications between North and South Viet Nam. These seem to be the reasons why he feels pressed to get his house in order primarily from a military-security point of view, so that he can, at long last, be in a position to prevent large-scale and effective communist infiltration and control any situation which may develop when he is obliged to open up greater intercourse between North and <pb xml:id="pg_882" n="882" facs="0912"/>South. Because of the pressure to permit some exchange of divided families, his brother <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> has told me they are considering a limited and controlled exchange of persons in the near future. There are also signs which may indicate that he wants his military-security forces built up in order to control any possible development of strong dissident elements other than communists.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Relations with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName></p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> and I have been fortunate to have been here when <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, through his astute understanding of the problems of Viet Nam and, to a large extent, of those of Southeast Asia as well, has made remarkable progress to the definite benefit of the Free World. We have had little need, up to now, to bring much pressure on him or “cross” him in regard to his policies. It appears probable, however, that more pressure may become necessary in the future. On some important issues, despite our advice to the contrary, he has proven to be right, a fact which tends to make him even more sure of himself. Therefore, he will not take direct advice easily.</p>
<p>We have, with good reason, encouraged him to assume a more important role as a Free World leader in Asia. He likes the role. As a matter of fact, he has given indications that the real or organized enthusiasm shown him on his visits may have gone to his head. He is beginning to look upon himself a bit too pointedly as the great hope of Southeast Asia. He has a sound perception of communist tactics and their effect in Asian countries, and enjoys his role of trying to explain them to Asians. However, in the process which absorbs much of his time, he apparently finds another excuse to postpone some essential decisions regarding his own country.</p>
<p>It is interesting to recall his earnest advice about <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Syngman Rhee</persName> to the effect that he is isolated by his advisors from the real facts of the internal situation in Korea, and that we should therefore pass the word along to friendly Ambassadors to see <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> more often and talk to him frankly about internal developments. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> faces the same problem but apparently does not realize it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Barrows</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">General Williams</persName> and I have had too often to persuade him to do or not do certain things, although we already had the concurrence of one of his Ministers in our suggested action. Since the Ministers do not always have the courage to tell him, we perhaps may have to do this to a greater extent in the future.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Proposed Courses of Action</p>
<p>To deal with these fundamental problems effectively and protect our interests, it would seem important in broad outline that:</p>
<p>1. On the internal front, we persuade the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to arrive at a number of decisions which have already been before them for some <pb xml:id="pg_883" n="883" facs="0913"/>time and for many of which U.S. aid money is already available, so that the economic and social development of the country can be given an effective impulse forward and carry with it the hopes of the people, rather than let him follow too blindly his current trend of placing more and more emphasis on building his military-security strength. This is perhaps our most essential task. Yet it must be recognized that outside influence will not be conclusive and may not be too effective. While we have so far not been too successful in influencing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>, nevertheless, we have found by experience that, on occasions. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> will take up, as his own, ideas which we had planted earlier and, in certain specific cases (the Cai San project, Saigon–Bien Hoa highway, the construction of Route 21 instead of 19, etc.), he has acceded to our viewpoint. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will continue to make its own decisions but we need to seek constantly for ways to make our influence more effective, even at the possible risk of temporarily antagonizing <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> to a certain extent. We shall, therefore, from time to time suggest for the Department’s consideration certain specific courses of action to be followed in our relations with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. For instance, at present, we are considering courses to deal with such pending questions as: the Civil Guard; the effectiveness of the Self-Defense Corps; the settlements program; the Medical Center; and various industrial projects.</p>
<p>2. On the external front, as we see it, stabilization and progress within Viet Nam itself is perhaps the most important contribution this country can make toward encouraging other countries in this area to protect their independence, resist communist blandishments and perhaps eventually pursue a Western-oriented policy. The mere creation of a strong military force will not of itself, as he now seems to feel, contribute to the ends we desire—namely, a fairly stable government friendly to the Free World and eventually economically independent.</p>
<p>Generally, we should encourage Viet Nam to pursue its policy of strengthening its position through active participation in international meetings and organizations—such as the Colombo Plan—through the maintenance and development of cordial relations with countries in the Free World and through broad exchanges with these countries.</p>
<p>Specifically, we should continue to seek to improve relations between Viet Nam and her immediate neighbors, Cambodia and Laos (provided Laos does not fall under Pathet Lao control). If we are successful in erecting a strong and progressive Viet Nam, this country can act with greater confidence toward the other two weaker states and eventually perhaps serve as the anchor state in the sub-peninsula, countering the drift of the area toward Communist China.</p>
<p>3. In sum, our most immediate and essential task here is, I believe, to continue to strive to influence <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and his regime to make <pb xml:id="pg_884" n="884" facs="0914"/>sound decisions as soon as possible and move forward on a balanced broad economic, social and military program so that disillusionment with the regime may be minimized, hope in the future engendered, and Viet Nam retained as a positive example in Asia that a free, independent Asian nation, firmly allied to the West and opposed to communism, can succeed and prosper. In view, however, of current leftist trends in Thailand, Laos and Cambodia it may be more difficult to attain these desirable ends as soon as we hope. It may be necessary, because of increased communist threats and subversion to go along, to a greater extent than otherwise would be the case, with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s desire to strengthen his military-security posture, provided he does not neglect almost entirely necessary economic and social developments.</p>
<p>In view of <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s reaction to the cut in aid levels for 1958 and the stepped up communist threat internally and externally, our most immediate task would appear to be to bring fairly strong pressure on him to take immediate decisions on those economic projects already waiting implementation. In our presentation of the aid levels for 1958, we stressed most firmly the urgent need to do just this. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and the others present agreed to work more closely with <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> to implement approved projects. If it is clear after careful study that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> cannot carry from its own resources the suggested increased contribution to the military budget, it would appear that we should try to make up for the loss in economic assistance by a PL 480 contribution and assist the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to work up acceptable projects for Development Loan funds. If this can be achieved part of the time lost during the past year in the economic field can be made up and a start made in building the economic infrastructure of the country. Under present circumstances of increased communist subversion and economic threat, there does not appear to be any possibility, at this time, to reduce the cost of the military-security forces. However, with the means already available and those foreseeable, we must use every means to start the creation of a solid economic base.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751G.5–MSP/11–3057)</note></p>
<p>1. It will not be easy for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> contribute <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> $1,457 million to 1958 military budget and perhaps impossible without imposition additional taxes. While Embassy–<gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> convinced imposition additional taxes selected imported consumption [<hi rend="italic">consumer</hi>] goods desirable both as source additional revenue and as means reducing consumption these items, also recognize <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> strongly opposed such action.</p>
<p>2. On the other hand we are convinced <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> can contribute more than <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> $900 million and will certainly accumulate more than that amount in counterpart fund derived from customs receipts. Nevertheless, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> persists asserting it cannot go beyond <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> $900 million and thus far has not engaged in any serious discussion this matter. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> disagreed with <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> estimates presented at national aid committee meeting September 27, but has offered no real evidence in support of its view.</p>
<p>3. Unfortunately, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> also included <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> $900 million figure in formal budget presentation National Assembly in face our warnings about probable aid cut and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> analysis probable total government revenues.

<p>4. <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>–Embassy position is that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> can contribute <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> $1,300 million discussed at aid committee meeting September 27 and has possibility reaching the <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> $1,457 million figure even without new taxes. (Increased contribution of <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> $4,967 million in the budget that we asked <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to contribute was caused by <gloss target="#t_CT1">C/T</gloss> acceptance of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> reclaimer asking for these additional sums above original <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>-approved military budget.) Basis for this opinion (which can be explained in detail by <persName corresp="#p_HWC1">Haraldson</persName> now on consultation Washington) in summary follows:</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_886" n="886" facs="0916"/>
<list>
<item>a. Since imposition production tax, March 1957, government revenues have been exceeding expenses; yield taxes has exceeded estimates. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> 1957 budget estimate production tax yield of <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> $150 million per month. Seven months taxes in effect by <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> $550 million. This is principal factor underlying <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> estimate that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will be able make <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> $900 million contribution to 1957 budget and still record <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> $400 million surplus above civilian expenses.</item>
<item>b. While some imports clearing customs 1958 will be somewhat below 1957, higher tax rates will be in effect twelve months instead nine. It thus seems reasonable believe that if 1957 ordinary receipts exceed civilian expenditures by <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> $1,300 million, budget can make at least as good showing in 1958.</item>
</list>
<p>5. Problem can be approached other ways. Example: Throughout 1956 and thus far in 1957 <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> deposits customs receipts (not including receipts from production, perequation [?] taxes) in counterpart fund have been running at rate of about <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> $100 million per month. Thus far that portion these funds in excess of so-called <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> contribution to military budget have remained in counterpart fund. <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> has never released such deposits for any purpose other than support military budget and presumably could not do so without specific Washington approval. Thus, from customs duties alone, to say nothing of other taxes levied upon aid-financed imports, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will derive more revenue than <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> $900 million proposed contribution to military budget.</p>
<p>6. Another approach: Aid-financing commercial imports now yield average <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> $50 per dollar of imports (<gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> $35 in exchange, <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> $15 in customs duties and tariff). <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> $50 x US $130 million (the amount of the 1958 aid identified as military budget support) equals <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> $6,500 million, or more than enough to cover <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> approved military budget, including both US contribution and so-called <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> contribution. In effect <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has fallen into habit relying on part of proceeds aid given for military budget, but also a substantial portion its civilian budget. Fact that Vietnamese have suddenly been made aware this extreme dependence on US merely adds to our difficulties, and does not make it easier for them accept calculations we have made.</p>
<p>7. In circumstances believe it best that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> be encouraged accept allocation recommended military contribution. If, during next few months it becomes clear <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> cannot contribute as much as we have proposed without serious economic consequences, we recommend additional aid be considered. As a last recourse and as means persuading <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> accept our proposal, recommend that further drawdown counterpart pipeline beyond US $5,800,000 already recommended be considered, and that we be authorized agree with them that an additional contribution from this source will be made if in <pb xml:id="pg_887" n="887" facs="0917"/>the course of <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> fiscal year government revenues from import duties and taxes do not attain the levels we have foreseen.</p>
<p>8. Following are country team views re Self-Defense Corps figure 43,500: total 43,500 based on detailed <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> staff study (para 7 <gloss target="#t_Embtels1">Embtel</gloss> 1122<note n="4" xml:id="d410fn4"><ref target="#d407">Document 407</ref>.</note>). <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and country team consider <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> units should be located in villages and towns along Laos–Vietnam and Cambodia–Vietnam borders, in other remote villages along possible avenues of approach in pacified but still vulnerable areas not protected by static units <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> units should be provided only for villages 5,000 or less. Size of units should vary according population villages, remoteness, other security forces and security requirements. Figure was calculated as follows:</p>

<head>411. Memorandum of a Conversation Between the President of the Republic of Vietnam (<persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>) and the Chief of the Military Assistance Advisory Group in Vietnam (<persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName>), Saigon, <date when="1957-12-20">December 20, 1957</date><note n="1" xml:id="d411fn1" type="source">Source: Center of Military History, <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName> Papers, Conversations with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> 16 Sep 57–28 Dec 57.

The source text is an attachment to a letter dated December 23 from <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Stump</persName> marked “Personal and Confidential”, which reads as follows: “I feel much of the attached should be for your eyes alone. The underlined part of paragraph 9 [printed here as italics] has been reported to the Ambassador. Also paragraphs 28–32 and 49. Other parts if revealed would only cause dissension.” <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName>’ report to Durbrow of the same date is also attached to the source text but not printed.</note></head>
<p>1. Following the Kontum–Mo Duc Road Project meeting at the palace 20 Dec 57, which many people attended the President asked <pb xml:id="pg_889" n="889" facs="0919"/>Gen <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName> to remain after the others had departed for a private talk. All the others departed and the conversation started at 1010. Lt Col <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster</persName> acted as interpreter.</p>
<p>2. The President started by referring to their visit the previous day (18–19 Dec) to Ban Me Thuot area. That from a map, you can see that the resettlement centers are each a nucleus of security. That at Pleiku and Kontum the centers are more remote and are near the border of Laos. That these centers near Laos are located in very fertile soil and therefore US <hi rend="italic">civilian</hi> advisors did not raise the usual objections.</p>
<p>3. He said that what we had seen in the resettlement centers had taken 6 months to achieve. That it wasn’t something improvised. That Mr <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> had suspected it was improvised. But that it was the result of 6 months work. That he (the President) had profited from the advice of <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> and French experts who had studied the problem for years. That there were <hi rend="italic">some</hi> sincere and honest Frenchmen who had studied it for a long time.</p>
<p>4. He said that after dinner at Ban Me Thuot the representative of the French embassy, <persName corresp="#p_WM1">M. Wintrebert</persName>, had spoken with the President, Mr <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PRW1">Parkes</persName> (British Ambassador) about the strategic importance of the High Plateau. That <persName corresp="#p_WM1">M. Wintrebert</persName> said exactly the same thing the President has been saying. That <persName corresp="#p_WM1">M. Wintrebert</persName> told them that if the 17th parallel, Pleiku and Kontum were lost, there would be no need to try to hold Ban Me Thuot because the whole central country would be lost. That the first line of defense should be the mountain passes between city of Vinh and Laos, but that this line is outside <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> territory. That the second best defense line is Savannaket–Dong Hoi (Highway 9), but it is too near the 17th parallel and is too flat to offer a natural defensive position. That as a consequence, the best defensive line for <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> is the line Kontum–Plateau of Boloven–Pak Se, which runs through very rough terrain and offers excellent natural obstacles. Gen <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName> agreed.</p>
<p>5. The President said Mr <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> was very much impressed to hear this from a Frenchman. That <persName corresp="#p_WM1">M. Wintrebert</persName> had said this without any prior discussion with the President. That <persName corresp="#p_WM1">M. Wintrebert</persName> was one of the best types of French officials who had served in Indo-China. That he had been born in Hanoi and lived most of his life in Vietnam. That Mr <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> had been saying that the President was stubborn and hard-headed, but now he is impressed.</p>
<p>6. He said that <persName corresp="#p_WM1">M. Wintrebert</persName> referred to the loss of Dien Bien Phu as minor compared to the loss of the High Plateau and said that <pb xml:id="pg_890" n="890" facs="0920"/>the French had brought their best legions—crack units—from Korea only to have them wiped out in the High Plateau. (This is an exaggeration—the French Bn I saw in Korea that came here in 52 or 53 could not be classed as a “crack unit.” STW)<note n="2" xml:id="d411fn2"><persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Samuel Tankersley Williams</persName>.</note></p>
<p>7. The President said that Mr <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> was beginning to learn what he had always told him.</p>
<p>8. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Gen Williams</persName> said that Gen Brown, Chief of PEO in Vientiane, Laos, was in Saigon this week and had told him that the Chief of Staff of the Army in Laos had ordered Engineer units into Pak Se in order to start repairing the road toward Kontum.</p>
<p>9. The President said that Laos wants to explain its position in Washington. That the President, Souvanna,<note n="3" xml:id="d411fn3">Prince Souvanna Phouma had become Prime Minister of Laos in March 1956.</note> and his Foreign Minister<note n="4" xml:id="d411fn4">Phoui Sananikone.</note> are coming through Saigon the 4th or 5th of January. That the Foreign Minister is coming along to try to keep Souvanna in line. That the Foreign Minister will then return to Laos while Souvanna goes to Paris to seek French advice before going to the US. That Souvanna speaks glibly about anti-communism; <hi rend="italic">but that Americans ought to transact all their business with him in writing</hi>.</p>
<p>10. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Gen Williams</persName> indicated surprise and interest.</p>
<p>11. The President said Laos wants very much to make a good impression in the US.</p>
<p>12. He said. “In any case, we (<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>) are making progress.” <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Gen Williams</persName> agreed.</p>
<p>13. Referring to his approaching visit to Burma, the President said that Mr &amp; Mrs <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> left for Burma that morning (20 Dec) for a 4 day visit and added “<hi rend="italic">I am doing the US diplomats’ work for them</hi>.”</p>
<p>14. The President said that people ought to appreciate the help he is giving them and that is why the reduction in US aid makes him “really angry.”</p>
<p>15. He said that without US aid, <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> will make no progress. That he had hoped in <hi rend="italic">five years</hi> <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> would be self-sufficient and even able to support most of its defense budget. But that the reduction in US aid paralyzes progress. That <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> will have to depend on the US indefinitely.</p>
<p>16. He said Korea and Formosa have limited economic possibilities and no one knows when they will become self-sufficient. That to rely on US aid indefinitely is bad. That in 5 years, <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> with increased US aid could become self-sufficient, even for the defense budget, except for some loans.</p>
<p>17. He said US policy is short-sighted and makes his programs drag on and on. That it is not economical in the long run.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_891" n="891" facs="0921"/>
<p>18. The President said he would like to send 1 or 2 Public Works experts to look at any Engineer equipment in the depots to see if they can expedite spare parts supply. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Gen Williams</persName> agreed it was a good idea to get their recommendations if they had any to make.</p>
<p>19. The President said it takes too long to get spare parts for machinery through <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> channels. That he was considering using some of his foreign exchange to buy critical spare parts abroad.</p>
<p>20. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Gen Williams</persName> said this should not be necessary for military equipment. That he had been severely criticized recently by a visiting inspection team for requisitioning some medical supplies which turned out later to be already on hand in <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>. That he told the inspection team that this is true and that it is quite possible he is doing the same thing in respect to spare parts for machinery. That in fact, all the tech services may be doing it. But that he is having an inventory made as quickly as possible to avoid just this condition. The <gloss target="#t_TERM1">TERM</gloss> has been working along those lines now for over a year.</p>
<p>21. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Gen Williams</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> officers are not entirely to blame for the situation. That when the French left, they dumped case afer case of spare parts out in the open exposed to the rain. That the labels had been washed off the cases and no one knew what was inside. That in any event, the cases were often full of assorted spare parts which the French had dumped into them carelessly. That the <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> officers who received this equipment were utterly untrained in how to classify and store it, because the French had never permitted them to take responsibility, nor had ever taught them how to operate logistical installations.</p>
<p>22. The President asked whether the Korean Army Corps of Engineers is well advanced.</p>
<p>23. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Gen Williams</persName> answered that from his past observation he would say they are excellent. That they had been advised by US officers for many years. That they had progressed so fast and had taken over so much responsibility that, he understood in 1953 it became necessary to stop and draw back a little because evidence of dishonesty and corruption had appeared. That he remembered when you could by radio parts in blackmarket on the streets of Seoul more easily than you could draw them from the depots.</p>
<p>24. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Gen Williams</persName> added that he believed such a condition would be impossible in <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> because US advisors watch every operation too closely and because of Pres <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>’s well known intolerance of dishonesty. He said there might be isolated instances of petty graft; but large scale black marketing of military equipment is impossible.</p>
<p>25. The President said he wants the Kontum–Mo Due road completed on time.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_892" n="892" facs="0922"/>
<p>26. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Gen William</persName> said the meeting that morning (20 Dec) would energize it. That many little things could be done at once as a result of the meeting. That the case of the Philco technicians was an example. That his Engineers together with Assistant <gloss target="#t_CO1">CO</gloss>, 12th Light Div had tried to find quarters in Kontum for the Philco technicians, but the <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> wouldn’t rent quarters. That these technicians are available and could be in Kontum helping the road project; but they can’t go until there is a place for them to live. That the President’s personal interest in the project as expressed at the meeting should give the project a push and energize it.</p>
<p>27. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Gen Williams</persName> reminded him that the US Engineers had said the road could be completed in 1958 provided it received adequate support from Saigon.</p>
<p>28. The President said the High Plateau was unknown territory to most people until the attempted assassination of the President in Ban Me Thuot last February. That this attracted their attention to the area and now they know more about it.</p>
<p>29. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Gen Williams</persName> asked whether any army troops had been employed on security during the President’s visit to Ban Me Thuot 19–20 Dec.</p>
<p>30. The President said very few. (Actually I saw none.)</p>
<p>31. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Gen Williams</persName> said he asked because he had not seen any soldiers guarding the roads.</p>
<p>32. The President said again that before the February assassination attempt, the area was not well known. That now you get the impression that it has been settled for 50 years. That this obvious progress gives everyone a sense of confidence.</p>
<p>33. The President said he wants to accelerate the Kontum–Mo Due road project by having the Dept of Public Works construct 20 or 30 <gloss target="#t_km1">km</gloss> of road starting from Mo Due on the Coast. This is appropriate because this section of the road is in the province of Quang Nai and not in the High Plateau. That he wants them to get something accomplished before the rainy season.</p>
<p>34. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Gen Williams</persName> agreed, saying that they ought at least to start widening the right of way.</p>
<p>35. The President said it will give the people in the Hue–Tourane area confidence to know that they can get to the High Plateau quickly and vice versa. That this uplift of spirit is contagious and will animate the whole area. That possibly its effects will be felt across the 17th parallel.</p>
<p>36. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Gen Williams</persName> said the road offers every advantage, both military and economic.</p>
<p>37. The President said that the last priority on the road is clearing and grading the right of way and getting the bridges in.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_893" n="893" facs="0923"/>
<p>38. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Gen Williams</persName> emphasized the importance of clearing so that the sun can get to the road and dry it.</p>
<p>39. The President said that corrections and refinements can come in 1959. That crushed rock can be stock piled along the road for these corrections in 1959.</p>
<p>40. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Gen Williams</persName> said one of the most important things is to get the steel bridging materials. That the most important thing is a sense of urgency. That the President had certainly imparted a sense of urgency to the people at the meeting that morning.</p>
<p>41. The President said the French had made great efforts in the High Plateau. That the situation in the High Plateau in Laos had hurt them seriously—much more than Dien Bien Phu.</p>
<p>42. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Gen William</persName> agreed saying that Dien Bien Phu was only the last of several defeats but it probably caused the signing of the Armistice.</p>
<p>43. The President said <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> must hold the High Plateau or lose the entire central country.</p>
<p>44. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Gen Williams</persName> said US military officers had known this for a long time.</p>
<p>45. The President quoted <persName corresp="#p_WM1">M. Wintrebert</persName> as saying that the visibility for aircraft in the High Plateau is not just poor, it doesn’t exist. The President said that this was the first time he had heard a Frenchman say this.</p>
<p>46. The President said he is putting most of his road building effort toward the north. That others like Capital Engineering and Johnson Drake &amp; Piper chose easier routes. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Gen Williams</persName> agreed that road building in the North–Central section was a great importance.</p>
<p>47. The President said he wants to have a route from Dak To to Hue reconnoitered. That he would have a better feeling of security with such a road. (This is extension of Highway 14 north of Kontum.)</p>
<p>48. He said there are so many difficulties that most people don’t even want to think about them.<note n="5" xml:id="d411fn5"><p>The following exchange occurred during the conversation between <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName> held December 13:</p>
<p>“104. The President said that if he could spend two months concentrating on the Army to the exclusion of everything else, then the Army would run more smoothly. That everytime the Army wants to spend money, he asks why, that he tells them over and over that they must accomplish things with the smallest expenditure possible. That what he needs is several good administrators.</p>
<p>“105. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Gen Williams</persName> said he feels sure Vietnam will have them someday.</p>
<p>“106. The President paused, looked down, and then said, ‘if we don’t accomplish something strong and vigorous in 1958, I fear the future.’</p>
<p>“107. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Gen Williams</persName> said he should never say anything like that. Someone might think he was despondent.</p>
<p>“108. The President said, ‘I say that only to you.’</p>
<p>“109. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Gen Williams</persName> said, I am sure you will win in the long run.’ ” (Memorandum of conversation; Center of Military History, <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Williams</persName> Papers, Conversations with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> 16 Sep 57–28 Dec 57; drafter not indicated)</p></note></p>
<pb xml:id="pg_894" n="894" facs="0924"/>
<p>49. The President said that north of Kontum he is establishing Montagnard resettlement centers. That the streams in that area flow into Laos and the Montagnards believe their interests lie in the direction where the water flows. That the Communists (in Laos) are trying to attract the Montagnards to their side and many have moved over. That he is anxious to draw them back and get them settled in the centers. That <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> aid takes too long and he has started the project by himself.</p>
<p>50. The President said he had set up an air strip for L–19 aircraft in the forest 30 <gloss target="#t_km1">km</gloss> from Hue in the direction of Laos. That this area is a possible invasion route and it has no communications. That now there is an air bridge to it and it is less isolated. That he had told Gen <persName corresp="#p_TVD2">Don</persName> (<gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss>, I Corps)<note n="6" xml:id="d411fn6"><persName corresp="#p_TVD2">Tran Van Don</persName>.</note> to build a bicycle trail from Hue to the air strip. That in case of war, if the <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> defenses along the 17th parallel are strong, the Viet Cong will try to <hi rend="italic">outflank them</hi> through this area even though they <hi rend="italic">must violate the neutral territory of Laos to do it</hi>.</p>
<p>51. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Gen William</persName> remarked that it was obvious the President surely studies the terrain of his country and thinks of these things.</p>
<p>52. The President said he has lots of ideas because he has studied these problems closely for many years.</p>
<p>53. The President said he wants to move ahead and get some things done very quickly, so he can study other problems. That he must <hi rend="italic">arouse</hi> the people.</p>
<p>54. The President said that some people (i.e. foreigners) say he is thinking in the clouds and is not a realist. That they will understand in 5 years time—or earlier if there is an invasion. That on the trips to Ca Mau and Ban Me Thuot last week they saw that his feet are planted on solid ground. (<hi rend="italic">Note</hi>: Pres had taken several ambassadors on these trips within last few days.)</p>
<p>55. He said that he built the resettlement centers at Ca Mau and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> didn’t care to see them until after everything was installed. That in planning for development here, you must take Asian conditions into account.</p>
<p>56. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Gen Williams</persName> said conditions in every country are peculiar to that country.</p>
<p>57. The President said the US developed in peace for hundreds of years; but <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> is practically in a state of war.</p>
<p>58. <hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Gen Williams</persName> said yes, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> must consider they are in an armistice period</hi>.</p>
<p>59. <persName corresp="#p_WLGST1">Gen Williams</persName> and Lt Col <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster</persName> departed 1200.</p>
