                <p>The publication <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi>
                    constitutes the official record of the foreign policy of the United States. The
                    volumes in the series include, subject to necessary security considerations, all
                    documents needed to give a comprehensive record of the major foreign policy
                    decisions of the United States together with appropriate materials concerning
                    the facts that contributed to the formulation of policies. Documents in the
                    files of the Department of State are supplemented by papers from other
                    government agencies involved in the formulation of foreign policy.</p>
                <p>The basic documentary diplomatic record printed in the volumes of the series is
                    edited by the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, Department of
                    State. The editing is guided by the principles of historical objectivity and in
                    accordance with the following official guidance first promulgated by Secretary
                    of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925:</p>
                <p>There may be no alteration of the text, no deletions without indicating the place
                    in the text where the deletion is made, and no omission of facts which were of
                    major importance in reaching a decision. Nothing may be omitted for the purpose
                    of concealing or glossing over what might be regarded by some as a defect of
                    policy. However, certain omissions of documents are permissible for the
                    following reasons: <list>
                        <label>a.</label>
                        <item>To avoid publication of matters that would tend to impede current

                            possible, to show the alternative presented to the Department before the

                <p>In preparing this volume, the editors have focused upon the principal expressions
                    of major U.S. political and economic policy toward the Communist governments of
                    Eastern Europe and the few significant <pb n="IV" xml:id="pg_IV" facs="0008"
                    />bilateral diplomatic exchanges with those governments during the 1955–1957
                    period. The Government of Finland maintained its democracy and independence but
                    in the shadow of the close Soviet presence. The documentation presented here
                    exemplifies the kinds of information and insights available to U.S. policymakers
                    in Washington and the conclusions and analyses that were drawn regarding the
                    scope and significance of the Communist control of the populations of Eastern
                    Europe. U.S. policymakers viewed Eastern Europe as part of the “Soviet bloc” and
                    formulated their evaluations and options toward the “satellite” governments on a
                    regional basis. The largest portion of the documents presented in this volume
                    reflect that contemporary regional frame of reference.</p>
                <p>Major turning points in the long postwar period of Communist domination of
                    Eastern Europe were the uprisings in Poznań in Poland in 1956 and the Hungarian
                    rebellion of 1956. The editors have highlighted these historic occurrences and
                    presented as separate chapters the documentation on U.S. understanding and
                    perception of these events and official policies adopted toward them. The
                    editors made a special effort to document the U.S. information policy toward the
                    Hungarian rebellion and the development of policies regarding the broadcasts of
                    the Voice of America during the crisis.</p>
                <p>President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D. Eisenhower</persName>, usually
                    working through Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">John Foster
                        Dulles</persName> and the National Security Council apparatus, exercised the
                    decisive role in the definition of U.S. policy toward Eastern Europe. The
                    editors had the fullest possible access to the Presidential and National
                    Security Council materials for these years at the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                        >Eisenhower</persName> Presidential Library in Abilene, Kansas and in the
                    Department of State. While the Presidential and <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                        >NSC</gloss> documents represent only a small portion (one-sixth) of the
                    record printed here, they define the main line of American policy. They are
                    presented here in relatively complete form although there have been significant
                    deletions in some documents to protect national security information.</p>
                <p>The files of the Department of State were the primary source of records for this
                    volume. Three-quarters of the documents printed here are from those files. The
                    editors have emphasized diplomatic reporting and the evolution of U.S. official
                    perceptions of the Eastern European regimes. It was not practical to document
                    the details of the difficult and seriously circumscribed status of U.S.
                    diplomatic missions in these countries. The activities of military, information,
                    cultural, and economic representatives and officials in Eastern Europe at this
                    time were even more constrained than those of the diplomatic missions. The
                    editors chose, by and large, not to try to include official documentation
                    regarding these minor activities in this volume.</p>
                <p>U.S. intelligence assessments of Soviet military, political, and economic
                    intentions and of developments in the Eastern European nations were important
                    factors in the formulation of U.S. official attitudes and actions during the
                    period covered by this volume. The <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0009"/>editors
                    have been able to include some of the most significant high-level intelligence
                    evaluations regarding Eastern Europe at this time, including National
                    Intelligence Estimates and intelligence briefings to the National Security
                    Council by the Director of Central Intelligence. The editors were not able and
                    did not seek to document intelligence operational activities in Eastern Europe
                    from the records available in the Department of State or those of any other
                    government agency.</p>
                <p>The official record presented in this volume has been supplemented by information
                    from some of the principal memoirs of government officials who served during the
                    period. A complete list of documentary sources and printed volumes cited in the
                    volume is printed on pages IX–XV.</p>
                <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Editorial Methodology</hi></p>
                <p>The documents printed in the volume are presented chronologically, but during the
                    Hungarian uprising and its suppression telegrams and other documents originating
                    in Eastern Europe are presented according to local time. Memoranda of
                    conversations are placed according to the time and date of the conversation,
                    rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the Editor in Chief and the chief technical editor. The source
                    text is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other
                    notations, which are described in footnotes. Obvious typographical errors are
                    corrected, but other mistakes and omissions in the source text are corrected by
                    bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an omission in roman
                    type. Brackets are also used to indicate text that has been omitted by the
                    compiler because it deals with an unrelated subject. Ellipses are inserted to
                    replace material that remained classified after the declassification review
                    process. Ellipses of three or four periods identify excisions of less than a
                    paragraph; ellipses of seven periods spread across the page identify excisions
                    of an entire paragraph or more. All ellipses and brackets that appear in the
                    source text are so identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document’s source, original
                    classification, distribution, drafting information, and, in the case of
                    telegrams, the time of receipt in the Department of State. The source footnote
                    also provides, whenever possible, background information and an indication of
                    who read the document. Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize
                    pertinent material not printed in this volume, indicate the location of
                    additional documentary sources, provide references to important related
                    documents printed in other volumes, and provide summaries of and citations to
                    public statements that supplement and elucidate the printed documents.</p>

                    review is to release as much information as is consistent with contemporary
                    requirements of national security and sound foreign relations; some documents
                    originally selected and portions of documents presented have been withheld.</p>
                <p>Edward C. Keefer and Stanley Shaloff edited the documents on U.S. policy toward

                        <p>The Balkan Pact, formalized by the Treaty of Bled of August 9, 1954, soon
                            became dormant as a result of Yugoslavia’s rapprochement with the Soviet
                            Union, culminating in the visit of Soviet leaders to Belgrade in May
                            1955, and of the conflict between Greece and Turkey over Cyprus,
                            especially after the anti-Greek riots in Turkey of September 1955.

                        <p>Assuming that the purpose of the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> in
                            making this assignment was to accomplish, if possible, the detachment of
                            a major European satellite, the Working Group further concluded that
                            “unless the power balance between the United States and the Soviet Union
                            changes drastically in our favor, there is little likelihood of
                            detaching a major satellite at any time without grave risk of war except
                            by negotiation. The only satellite which now lends itself to possible
                            detachment by this means is East Germany. If an effort against this
                            satellite were to be undertaken with any hope of success it would
                            require a concentration of political, economic and psychological
                            measures directed to this end.” A study of the requirements of such a
                            concentrated effort should now be undertaken with East Germany as the
                            target in order that advantage may be taken of any future development
                            making possible the unification of Germany by negotiation on terms
                            acceptable to the United States.</p>
                        <p>With respect to general policy toward individual satellite countries
                            looking toward the accomplishment of U.S. objectives, the Working Group
                            further expressed the view that soft treatment cannot be expected to
                            effect the basic changes in the nature of communist regimes which would
                            conform to U.S. objectives; and that, therefore, except when relaxations
                            are calculated to obtain carefully defined limited objectives within a
                            short time span or to protect the people against the regime under
                            special circumstances of internal tension, pressures should be increased
                            against any part of the Soviet orbit where suitable opportunities
                            appear. The importance of this subject justifies study of appropriate
                            implementing actions consistent with U.S. policy as it develops.</p>
                        <p>The summary of the paper contains in Paragraph 4c, last sentence, the
                            following statement “Such a concentrated effort should now be undertaken
                            with East Germany as the target.” This sentence was added after
                            consideration of the paper by the Board of Assistants and since it
                            constitutes a policy recommendation should not be considered to be a
                            recommendation of the Working Group.</p>

                            feasibility of detaching a satellite. The conclusions 4a and 4b are
                            responsive to the terms of reference but 4c deals with making a
                            concentrated effort with a view at some future time to detaching East
                            Germany; that this is not within the charter of the working group; that
                            with reference to East Germany one really means “unification” and not
                            “detachment”. General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> went
                            on to say that paragraph 5 is an expression of an opinion by the working

                                    target="frus1955-57v19#pg_9">vol. XIX, p. 9</ref>.</note> It was
                            General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>’s feeling that
                            certainly the working group should not deal with this policy question
                            and he doubted whether the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> itself
                            should deal with such a policy question. In summary, General <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> said he felt that 4a and 4b were
                            acceptable, that 4c should be referred to the “committee” about which he
                            had informed the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> at luncheon and
                            that paragraph 5 should be dropped.<note n="5" xml:id="d4fn5">The
                                reference to the “committee” is unclear.</note></p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> remarked that perhaps paragraph 5 would
                            be a natural task for the Presidential committee which General <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> had mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> stated that he
                            understood that the last sentence of paragraph 4c had been added after
                            the paper had been considered by the working group and by the Board
                            Assistants and that it was not agreed to by anyone. He suggested that
                            the sentence be changed to call for a study to be made.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0037"/>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> said that he liked
                            the change which the Department of State had suggested but he still felt
                            that the “committee” should handle this item.</p>
                        <p>At this point, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said
                            that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is continually needing guidance
                            on this question of “soft” versus “provocative” courses of action. He
                            added that he for one believed that Czechoslovakia would never have been
                            lost if someone had been there doing something about it. . . . He
                            emphasized that the so-called completely “soft” policy is subject to
                            misinterpretation and we are apt to lapse into a do nothing policy.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> remarked that he
                            still did not like paragraph 5.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> suggested one or two
                            minor drafting changes in paragraph 5 which were discussed briefly.
                            Following this, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>
                            stated that it is not <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> which is
                            expressing this opinion but it is merely the working group and that the
                            working group, contrary to what General <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                                >Cutler</persName> had said, was not outside its terms of reference
                            in making such a suggestion. He said he felt the <gloss target="#t_OCB1"
                                >OCB</gloss> should encourage rather than discourage the working
                            groups to make such suggestions. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1"
                                >Stassen</persName> pointed out that the Board was only asked to
                            concur in 4a, 4b and 4c and that 5 remained merely the view of the
                            working group.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then suggested that
                            paragraph 5 be taken out of the summary and left in the paper as it now
                            is in paragraph 38.<note n="6" xml:id="d4fn6">Paragraph 5 of the summary
                                section of the Working Group paper of December 30, 1954, and
                                paragraph 38 of the “Conclusions” section of the same paper are
                                similar, except paragraph 38 contains additional comments about
                                Hungary being a case in point of a satellite facing setbacks and
                                internal problems as well as a concluding sentence that reads: “Only
                                by maintaining a firm position based on strength can the U.S.
                                preserve the balance which is essential to prevent war and hope to
                                exploit to its advantage Soviet weaknesses as they develop.”</note>
                            General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> thought that
                            paragraph 4c should be referred to the Presidential committee when it is
                            appointed.</p>
                        <p>It was finally agreed that paragraph 5 would be put in as paragraph 4,
                            ahead of recommendations in which the Board is asked to concur. This was
                            generally accepted.</p>

                            <item>Acting on the suggestion of the Board Assistants, the <gloss
                                    target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>, at its meeting of August 25, 1954,
                                requested the Working Group to review additional possible actions to
                                implement <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 174, particularly a
                                major coordinated effort by appropriate agencies designed to detach
                                one of the important European satellites from the Soviet bloc. The
                                Working Group was requested to submit a preliminary staff analysis
                                to the Board which would point up the policy and strategic
                                implications and feasibility factors that would be involved in such
                                an effort. At their meeting of August 13, 1954, the Board Assistants
                                agreed that Albania should not be considered as an “important”
                                satellite for the purposes of this study.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>The Working Group first reviewed existing intelligence estimates
                                of the political situation concerning all of the Eastern European
                                satellites. Then a study was made of the methods that might be used
                                to detach a satellite. U.S. capabilities for such action were
                                reviewed and conclusions flowing from the analysis were drawn.
                                Studies on the vulnerabilities of East Germany and Czechoslovakia
                                were prepared especially for this review.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>The analysis indicates that the instrumentalities of Soviet
                                dominion in the political, economic and cultural fields, backed by
                                military force, continue to be effective in maintaining control over
                                the satellites. The progressive sovietization of the political,
                                social and economic structure of the satellites, the orientation of
                                the local economies towards the East and the concentrated effort at
                                indoctrination of the rising generation have served further to
                                support Moscow’s control over the satellite areas. The Soviet orbit
                                nevertheless has vulnerabilities which are susceptible to
                                exploitation by the United States.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Without attempting to be categorical, it is the opinion of the
                                Working Group that soft treatment cannot be expected to effect the
                                basic changes in the nature of communist regimes which would conform
                                    <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0039"/>to U.S. objectives; and
                                that therefore, except when relaxations are calculated to obtain
                                carefully defined limited objectives within a short time span or to
                                protect the people against the regime under special circumstances of
                                internal tension, pressures should be increased against any part of
                                the Soviet orbit where suitable opportunities appear. The importance
                                of this subject justifies study of appropriate implementing actions
                                consistent with U.S. policy as it develops.</item>

                                <item>At present, given the strength of the Soviet position, no
                                    major Soviet satellite presents vulnerabilities of such extent
                                    that their exploitation can be expected to result in its
                                    detachment from the Soviet bloc.</item>
                                <label>b.</label>
                                <item>U.S. capabilities under present conditions are not sufficient
                                    to accomplish the detachment of any major Soviet satellite by
                                    means short of war.</item>
                                <label>c.</label>
                                <item>Unless the power balance between the United States and the
                                    Soviet Union changes drastically in our favor, there is little
                                    likelihood of detaching a major satellite at any time without
                                    grave risk of war except by negotiation. The only satellite
                                    which now lends itself to possible detachment by this means is
                                    East Germany. If an effort against this satellite were to be
                                    undertaken with any hope of success it would require a
                                    concentration of political, economic and psychological measures
                                    directed to this end. A study of the requirements of such a
                                    concentrated effort should now be undertaken with East Germany
                                    as a target in order that advantage may be taken of any future
                                    development making possible the unification of Germany by
                                    negotiation on terms acceptable to the U.S.</item>

                            Eastern Europe, the position which the U.S. Government must take would
                            not differ materially from the stand we assumed in 1953.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, the courses of specific action to be taken by the U.S. are
                            severely circumscribed by over-riding presently applicable policy
                            considerations. Basically this means that the U.S. must not adopt any

                        <p>Since any active courses of action embarked upon by the U.S. in such a
                            rebellious situation would likely cause one or more of the above
                            reactions, and since such actions are clearly not in concert with
                            established U.S. national policy, positive activity by the U.S. is not
                            feasible.</p>
                        <p>Thus, should a situation of revolt develop, the U.S. would have to
                            confine itself (1) to dissemination of the facts of the ensuing action
                            and (2) to expressions of sympathy, passive encouragement and moral
                            support coupled with whatever political steps would be deemed feasible
                            and effective in the light of the actual circumstances. No attempts to
                            encourage the participants could justifiably be made which would result
                            in needless loss of life.</p>

                        <p>434. Broad outlines of developments in Hungary past few months—apparently
                            in fairly close step with those elsewhere in Soviet empire and at times
                            visible in advance—now more clearly discernible. Basic elements in trend
                            seem to be: Shift so far conclusively evident only in propaganda towards
                            heavy and war industry; slight actual upward revision certain industry
                            goals with increasing emphasis on over-all efficiency and (apparently)
                            on machine industry; increasing discrimination favoring Socialist sector
                            agriculture; and more repressive measures against population. These
                            first perceived in December, distinct after first of year and now
                            confirmed by latest Central Committee resolution. Seems evident shift
                            brought about by doctrinaire, <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0043"
                            />Muscovite and anti-western elements, with Rakosi at present leading
                            this camp. Practically certain that Rakosi element has firm support of
                            group now dominant in Kremlin.</p>
                        <p>In assessing cause of above, obvious that situation here closely
                            connected with that in USSR. Less clear, however, is exact relationship
                            between two; that is, whether situation in USSR prime cause of changes
                            here, or whether former merely such as to allow developments in Hungary
                            to mature. On one hand growing international tension, with threat German
                            rearmament major component, presumably important and perhaps dominant
                            factor in determining recent course events in Soviet Union and so
                            indirectly of those here. At same time, recent output strongly suggests
                            that ideological struggle over basic Communist dogma itself, involving
                            role of Party in Communist society, rights of individual within
                            framework of Party’s role and extent individual’s and nation’s
                            independence relative to system (latter including growth liberal and
                            nationalist tendencies with undertones of Titoism) represents powerful
                            underlying local factor. Furthermore, relatively meager results achieved
                            under new course in Hungary—in turn largely function of inherent
                            weakness in Communist system—doubtless played significant role. In any
                            event regardless of how such factors weighted, some combination of these
                            influences evidently allowed present Hungarian leaders to gain upper

                        <p>Looking ahead, we anticipate general tightening up in all fields. Party
                            discipline will doubtless be strengthened, class warfare pushed more
                            openly, increased force employed bring backsliders and recalcitrants

                            Effects these policies will probably include increased popular
                            antagonism toward regime, due to increased police repression and

                            standards. In addition, individuals (probably great majority) within
                            party and government who had sincerely believed in or hoped for new
                            course as long-range policy rather than tactical move, as well as
                            individuals (also great majority) within regime who underneath inclined
                            put national Hungarian interests above Moscow dictates, should feel
                            growing antagonism to ruling faction not only from conviction but also
                            from considerations personal security. In economic field, efforts modify
                            reorientation toward increased output consumer goods, although only
                            partially affected, should produce further dislocations; and major
                            effect will probably be felt in countryside as regime put screws on
                            private peasants. As already reported, we see little reason believe
                            policies which failed once can achieve greater success on second run.

                            during this period, both in Moscow and Budapest, will face failure on
                            both international and domestic fronts. Then particularly should Western
                            powers show readiness to negotiate outstanding differences, on
                            reasonable basis but from position greater strength and without yielding
                            on essentials, ground should be much more favorable for recapture

                            satisfactory economic objectives and popular response on second try
                            would probably threaten this group’s prominence. (This excellent point
                            for media build-up.) Impossible now judge how poor conditions would have
                            to become before Soviets might feel obliged take remedial action, but we
                            believe downhill slide towards this point will probably continue and may
                            even accelerate. Undoubtedly this factor present in Rakosi’s mind and

                            foothold for use later; focusing media attacks more on specific
                            doctrinaire element in regime and anti-nationalist tendencies of this
                            leadership; and attempting devise programs and actions which will reach
                            and benefit Hungarian people directly, such as food, medical aid offers,
                            giving away information on advanced agricultural methods, etc. Even if
                            refused by regime, such actions would be known to Hungarian public and
                            hit responsive cord. Then when and if grip of doctrinaire Muscovites
                            weakens, renewed pressure for concessions, accompanied by increasing
                            gestures goodwill toward Hungarian people as appropriate, could probably
                            have some success in affecting Hungarian policy orientation.</p>

                        <p>To assess the strengths and weaknesses of the Hungarian Communist regime,
                            to evaluate the regime’s policies and probable courses of action, and to

                        <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>1. Hungary has in recent years shown consistent evidence of political
                            disharmony and economic dislocation, accompanied by popular unrest, and
                            will probably continue to be the most troublesome of the East European
                            Satellites. Much of the popular dissension arises from the Hungarians’
                            deep-seated hostility toward Communism and toward the Slavs who have
                            imposed Communism upon them. They <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0047"
                            />do not have the antagonism toward the Germans displayed by the Czechs
                            and the Poles. However, the security forces at the disposal of the
                            government, plus the presence of Soviet forces, are sufficient to cope
                            with any active resistance. In any event, we believe that the Kremlin
                            will take all measures necessary to keep Hungary in the Bloc. (Paras.
                            7–15, 19–28, 34)</p>
                        <p>2. Although the Communist regime restored the economy and, in some
                            directions, notably heavy industry, expanded it, Hungary’s economic
                            difficulties multiplied. The introduction of the “New Course” in 1953
                            failed to resolve the problems in industry and agriculture. In industry
                            the failure is attributable to an inadequate raw materials base,
                            inexperienced management, and inability to provide sufficient worker
                            incentives. In agriculture, mismanagement coupled with general peasant
                            resistance to agrarian policies accounted for most of the difficulties.
                            Living conditions did not improve during 1954 and, in the urban areas,
                            were clearly below prewar levels. (Paras. 7–9, 14–15)</p>
                        <p>3. Improvement in the Hungarian economy is unlikely to take place unless
                            a substantial increase in agricultural production can be achieved.
                            Prospects for this are poor under existing Communist policies. (Paras.
                            16–18)</p>
                        <p>4. The Hungarian Army and Air Force are capable of participating in a
                            Bloc campaign against neighboring countries although sustained
                            operations would require extensive Soviet logistic support. The
                            reliability of the Army and Air Force is considered to be sufficiently
                            high for them to serve in occupation duties, to guard rear areas, or to
                            serve as integrated elements of a Soviet field force. The combat
                            effectiveness of the Hungarian Army is as high as that of any other
                            European Satellite, except Bulgaria; its primary limitation being the
                            questionable reliability of some of the troops. (Paras. 29–30)</p>

                        <p>5. Of all the European Satellites, Hungary has in recent years shown the
                            most consistent symptoms of political disharmony, economic dislocation,
                            and popular unrest. These symptoms have not extended to open revolt,
                            such as occurred in East Germany in June 1953, but they have been
                            sufficient to arouse doubts, from time to time, as to the ability of the
                            Communists to maintain power. We do not believe that the regime is, in
                            fact, seriously threatened. Nevertheless, Hungary is almost certainly
                            the most troubled of all the European states subject to the USSR. Its
                            population is overwhelmingly hostile to the Communist government, and is
                            apathetic and uncooperative toward the economic program. The economy has
                            been dislocated by unrealistic plans and by incompetent management. By
                            mid-1953, persistent failures led <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0048"
                            />to the introduction of a “New Course.” After about 18 months of
                            operation, the new policies had failed to bring about the hoped-for
                            improvements. In early 1955, certain modifications of “New Course”
                            policies were initiated. In spite of efforts by the Communists, the
                            situation has not been resolved.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">II. Economic Situation and Probable
                                Developments</hi></p>
                        <p>[Here follows a summary of Hungarian economic policy from 1945 to
                            1954.]</p>
                        <p>15. Thus, the Hungarian economy remains in a state of serious
                            dislocation. The standard of living of the people is generally low and
                            in the urban areas, except for the privileged, is substantially below
                            prewar levels. There is a very considerable number of black market
                            dealers who obtain much of their merchandise as a result of widespread
                            pilfering by workers. Agricultural machinery has thus far had little
                            effect because of poor maintenance, lack of spare parts, and the fact
                            that its use has been largely limited to the 30 percent of the land
                            comprising state and collective farms. Factories are badly planned, and
                            some of them are left unfinished. Those in operation produce generally
                            inferior goods at a high cost which makes it difficult to compete with
                            more efficient producers in foreign markets. The marked increases in
                                <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> represent almost entirely
                            capital equipment which, thus far, has contributed very little toward
                            the improvement of the welfare of the people.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Probable Economic Developments</hi></p>
                        <p>16. According to recent policy statements regarding the 1955 plan, some
                            of the former emphasis upon industrial production is to be restored.
                            Industrial production is scheduled to increase over 1954 by nearly six
                            percent and agriculture by slightly more than seven percent. National
                            income is to rise by nearly eight and one-half percent. The planned
                            increase in industry is made dependent largely upon raising productivity
                            and that in agriculture is to be achieved through larger acreage and
                            modernization. Hungary’s prospects for achieving these 1955 increases
                            are, at best, poor.</p>
                        <p>17. Hungary will almost certainly be unable to achieve any substantial
                            economic growth during the next few years under the present course, and
                            unless there is a significant modification in it, no improvement in
                            living standards is likely. Some temporary improvement may be obtained
                            through extended credits or import loans from either the USSR or the
                            West. The two basic difficulties impeding economic development—an
                            inadequate raw materials base and the stagnation in agriculture—have not
                            been resolved, and the regime has been unable to reduce the widespread
                            apathy and passive resistance of the people. Continued general emphasis
                            upon agricultural production, and particularly <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19"
                                facs="0049"/>upon increasing the amount of agricultural equipment
                            and chemical aids available to both collective farmers and individual
                            peasants, might lead to some increase in production, providing the
                            weather is favorable. The latest expression of economic policy, which
                            may have been dictated by USSR, suggests that there is little likelihood
                            during the next few years of any appreciable increase in the proportion
                            of national product assigned to meet current consumer needs. The outlook
                            after 1955 will be influenced by the role assigned to Hungary by the
                            USSR in the coordinated Bloc-wide planning period due to commence in
                            1956, but it will be even more dependent upon basic Hungarian
                            capabilities.</p>
                        <p>18. Over the long term, Hungary’s basic economic problem is that of
                            maintaining its industrial plant and importing a large part of the raw
                            materials essential to the operation of that plant. These imports can be
                            paid for by proceeds from the export of an agricultural surplus or,
                            alternatively, but less probably, manufactured products. Hungary had
                            been a predominantly agricultural country, but this basic pattern
                            changed as a result of the rapid industrialization and the lag in
                            agriculture since 1949. At present, Hungary’s industry will have
                            difficulty competing in world markets. Thus, of the two alternatives,
                            agriculture is probably the more economic means of paying for the needed
                            imports, but prospects are poor for achieving a significant surplus
                            under Communist agrarian policy.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">III. Political Developments</hi></p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Nature and Impact of the “New Course”</hi></p>
                        <p>19. Political developments in Hungary have been strongly influenced by
                            the independent character and traditions of the Hungarian people. They
                            have a deep-seated hostility toward Communism and toward the Slavs who
                            have imposed Communism upon them. The Hungarians feel that their ancient
                            parliamentary customs, Roman Catholic and Protestant heritage, and their
                            cultural tradition bind them to Western Europe. These factors, coupled
                            with the peoples’ recollections of Hungary’s earlier (1919) Communist
                            dictatorship, increase the regime’s difficulties in its efforts to
                            bolster its limited popular support.</p>
                        <p>20. Although the “New Course” laid primary emphasis upon economic policy,
                            it also offered a number of concessions of a political nature.
                            Specifically, it promised: (a) broader religious freedom; (b) a radical
                            change in police methods to increase individual security; (c) cessation
                            of deportation and liquidation of detention camps; and (d) a general
                            amnesty. The implementation of these promises has been both limited and
                            belated with resultant popular disillusion.</p>
                        <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0050"/>
                        <p>21. The promises and concessions of the “New Course” produced dissension
                            within the Communist Party. Some Party elements considered the new
                            program to be contrary to the principles of Communism. Many
                            functionaries feared that their own positions or authority might be
                            reduced, and that, in any case, control of the Party over the Hungarian
                            people would be substantially impaired. On the other hand, the adherents
                            of the “New Course” considered that implementation of its liberal
                            policies had become essential, if the Hungarian economy was to be
                            preserved from disaster and the goals of the Communist Party achieved.
                            Party leaders attempted to restore unity by a series of public
                            statements. Shortly after a plenum meeting of the Central Committee of
                            the Party in October, 1954, members of the Committee declared that
                            leaders who were unable or unwilling to carry out the “New Course” would
                            be replaced.</p>
                        <p>22. During 1954 and early 1955, Matyas Rakosi, Secretary of the Hungarian
                            Communist Party, became identified with the members of the Party faction
                            resisting what they considered to be the extremes of the “New Course,”
                            while Premier Nagy remained its chief defender. Since December, 1954,
                            Rakosi’s influence appears to have increased steadily, and the recent
                            shifts in Soviet economic priorities and leadership indicate that his
                            views are again dominant. Nagy’s disappearance from public view in early
                            1955 and the subsequent public attack by the Central Committee on his
                            “rightist incorrect emphasis” during the “New Course” furnish additional
                            evidence of this trend. Although dissension and vacillation over the
                            “New Course” have diminished the stature and prestige of the Party, we
                            believe that the party will continue to maintain effective leadership
                            and control.</p>
                        <p>23. The initial reaction of the Hungarian people in general to the
                            political promise of the “New Course” was a combination of opportunism
                            and unrealistic expectations. Public reaction was sharp when it
                            developed that many of the regime’s concessions fell far short of
                            meeting these high expectations. Even though the “New Course” did remove
                            a few of the political causes of popular dissatisfaction, the hostility
                            of the Hungarian people toward Communism and the Communist regime
                            continues.</p>
                        <p>24. The vast majority of Hungarians feel that their country was stolen
                            from them by a Communist minority, which gained power and retains it
                            only through the backing of Soviet armed forces. Even among the
                            industrial proletariat and youth—groups from which Communism has
                            generally drawn most of its adherents—the prevailing attitude ranges
                            from hostility through resentment to apathy.</p>
                        <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0051"/>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Prospects for Continued Communist
                                Control</hi></p>
                        <p>25. Active and organized resistance is virtually impossible because of
                            elaborate and effective police controls, but popular resentment is
                            expressed in open criticism of the regime and in widespread passive
                            resistance. This resentment manifests itself in a lack of cooperation,
                            deliberate misunderstanding of instructions, low quality production,
                            high damage and reject rates, and other kinds of subtle sabotage. This
                            pervasive passive resistance has been one of the important reasons for
                            the failure of the original Five-Year Plan and for the spotty
                            performance under the “New Course” since 1953.</p>
                        <p>26. While it is unlikely that the regime can soon eliminate the basic and
                            general hostility of the people, it has nevertheless at its disposal a
                            formidable security apparatus: to wit, the Security Police of 20,000 and
                            a Frontier Guard of 18,000. The Security Police is a highly mobile,
                            well-organized, politically reliable, and intensively trained force.
                            Although the Frontier Guard is probaby not as dependable as the Security
                            Police, its reliability is improving as a result of incessant political
                            indoctrination and selective recruiting. In addition, the regime
                            regularly uses the Communist Party, its informer network, its corps of
                            “political educators,” and numerous <gloss target="#t_MVD1">MVD</gloss>
                            members dispersed throughout the country to suppress subversion and to
                            maintain authority. The Civil Police force of more than 50,000, though
                            not as reliable as the security forces, can perform limited
                            assignments.</p>
                        <p>27. In case of widespread public disturbances, the regime has at its
                            disposal an Army of considerable size and a small Air Force. If the
                            situation got beyond the control of Hungarian forces, the Soviet forces
                            stationed in the country, including two Soviet mechanized divisions and
                            elements of the 59th Tactical Air Army, would almost certainly act with
                            or without an invitation. Additional Soviet troops could be quickly
                            brought into the country if needed.</p>
                        <p>28. With these forces available, there is little likelihood that
                            Communist control over Hungary will be jeopardized during the period of
                            this estimate, but the difficulties confronting the regime will continue
                            to be accentuated by the hostility of the people. Dissension in the
                            Party will continue to impair its effectiveness. In the absence of any
                            lasting solutions to Hungary’s basic problems, there will almost
                            certainly be reorganizations, new promises, and shifts in
                            leadership.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">IV. Military Strengths and
                                Capabilities</hi></p>
                        <p>29. The Hungarian Army consists of 150,000 men organized into 13 line
                            divisions (10 rifle, 1 cavalry, 1 mechanized, and 1 armored) with
                            sufficient combat support units. Under a system of compulsory universal
                            service, some 50,000 men are inducted into the Army each year and pass
                            into the reserve after two or, in some cases, three years. <pb n="22"
                                xml:id="pg_22" facs="0052"/>The number of well-trained reserves is
                            approximately 350,000 men. Upon mobilization, the size of the Army could
                            be quickly expanded, reaching a strength of 650,000 men by M + 180 days,
                            if adequate matériel support is provided by the Soviets. The Hungarian
                            Army is capable of participating in a Bloc campaign against its
                            neighbors although sustained operations would require extensive Soviet
                            logistic support. Army units also could be employed for occupation
                            duties and to guard rear areas and lines of communication, or they could
                            be integrated with Soviet field forces. The combat effectiveness of the
                            Hungarian Army is as high as that of any other European Satellite,
                            except Bulgaria; its primary limitations being the questionable
                            reliability of some of the troops. The reliability of the Army as a
                            whole, however, is considered to be sufficiently high for it to fight
                            effectively in the Bloc cause until it became apparent that the tide of
                            war was turning irrevocably against the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>30. The Hungarian Air Force has a complement of 13,000 men and an
                            estimated operational strength of 370 aircraft, including approximately
                            200 jet fighters, 110 ground attack planes, 40 light bombers, and 20
                            transports. During the past year, emphasis on primary and advanced
                            flying and on the recruitment of young pilots has already raised morale
                            and effectiveness, and the Air Force is considered to be loyal to the
                            regime. The Air Force will probably be further improved by gradual
                            advances in organization, by a continuation of the jet re-equipment
                            program, and by more extensive operational training.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">V. Hungary’s Role in the Bloc</hi></p>
                        <p>31. Like the other Satellites, Hungary is under the firm control of
                            Moscow. Basic policies are almost certainly dictated by the Kremlin,
                            perhaps in considerable detail. The campaign for industrialization and
                            the subsequent introduction of the “New Course” were common to all the
                            Satellites, although more pronounced in Hungary. The recently renewed
                            emphasis on heavy industry probably reflects, at least in part, a
                            conviction in Moscow that relaxation of pressures for industrial growth
                            had gone too far throughout the European Bloc.</p>
                        <p>32. There is no evidence that Moscow treats Hungary as a special case
                            among the Satellites, nor do we believe that the USSR would permit the
                            adoption of policies in Hungary which would conflict with programs laid
                            down for the Satellites generally. However, peculiarities exist in the
                            Hungarian political and psychological make-up which constitute sources
                            of intra-Satellite dissension. One is popular hostility toward
                            neighbouring beneficiaries of the country’s postwar territorial and
                            population losses: and, another is that the Hungarians, having no
                            territorial issue to settle with Germany, appear largely unmoved by
                            Communist propaganda against West German rearmament.</p>
                        <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0053"/>
                        <p>33. During the next several years, Hungary’s obvious economic
                            difficulties and the recalcitrance of its population will present
                            considerable problems to the Soviet rulers as well as to the Hungarian
                            regime. Improvement in Hungary’s managerial skill and in the people’s
                            attitude toward the regime will develop very slowly, if at all. Hungary
                            will continue to be a weak member of the Bloc, and might even, for a
                            time, cost more on balance in Bloc resources than it will
                            contribute.</p>
                        <p>34. Despite Hungary’s limited contribution to the Bloc’s power potential,
                            the Kremlin probably considers Hungary of value because it comprises an
                            important strategic area, and makes a contribution to Bloc military
                            strength. Economically, while Hungary may constitute a raw material
                            drain, it does supply certain specialized industrial and selected
                            agricultural products. Over the long term, Hungary may be able to
                            increase its contribution to the general viability of the Orbit economy
                            and to the Orbit integrated military front. Probably more important than
                            any of these factors, from the Kremlin’s point of view, is the prestige
                            involved in maintaining the Communist monolith intact. We believe,
                            therefore, that the Kremlin will take all measures necessary to keep
                            Hungary within the Bloc.</p>

                                    14, Nagy was stripped of his posts in government and in the
                                    Hungarian Workers’ Party by a Rákosi-promoted vote of the
                                    Central Committee. This completed Nagy’s political demise which
                                    had been anticipated since his denunciation on March 4 in the
                                    Central Committee as an “anti-Marxist right deviationist.” The
                                    premiership was transferred to Andras Hegedüs. (<hi

                        <p>Now that the air has cleared a little, it is possible to analyze with
                            somewhat greater accuracy the underlying reasons for and the sequence of
                            events culminating in the ouster of Prime Minister Nagy, and to chart
                            with somewhat greater precision the course which the new leadership in
                            Hungary appears to be laying out for itself.</p>
                        <p>A re-analysis of total output pertaining to internal developments in
                            Hungary since the beginning of March strongly suggests to us that,
                            contrary to what efforts have apparently been directed at making us
                            believe, the crisis here goes much further and deeper than a conflict
                            over economic policy, and that the fundamental causal factors are, if
                            anything, more politically than economically based. While much emphasis
                            has been placed on such factors as heavy versus light and consumer goods
                            industries, socialized agriculture versus individual farming and free
                            markets, etc., we have been impressed by the tone and implicit content
                            of output relating to the Party and to the role it should properly fill
                            in a communist society adhering to the precepts of Leninism-Stalinism
                            and coming under the complete domination of the Kremlin.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Accusations Against Nagy and Their
                                Validity</hi></p>
                        <p>Going back to the Central Committee resolution of March 4, we find that
                            Prime Minister Nagy and his right deviationist followers were accused of
                            four primary crimes: (1) denying the importance of <pb n="26"
                                xml:id="pg_26" facs="0056"/>heavy industry; (2) underestimating the
                            significance of constantly increasing productivity and reducing prime
                            costs; (3) failing to carry on class warfare in the villages
                            (eradication of kulaks), to stress resolutely enough that the leading
                            partner in the worker-peasant alliance is the working class, and to
                            encourage the development of collective farming; and (4) underestimating
                            the achievements of the Party and under-emphasizing the Party’s leading
                            role.</p>
                        <p>Assessing the justice of these particular accusations in turn, we find
                            that although Mr. <persName>Nagy</persName> was charged with denying the
                            importance of heavy industry and of attempting to push it into the
                            background, the shift back to heavy industry has been conclusively
                            evident thus far only in propaganda. Figures released in the Central
                            Committee resolution itself do not give substance to the lip service
                            being paid to heavy industry, and, if we examine the 1955 budget
                            presented to Parliament on April 19, we find that investment funds
                            scheduled for heavy industry for 1955 are 25 per cent below the amount
                            originally scheduled for 1954, and probably less than what was actually
                            spent last year. Moreover, total heavy industry expenditures for 1955
                            are scheduled at 3.15 billion forints, which is considerably less than
                            the 4.2 billion allotted this sector in 1954, and far below the amounts
                            spent in previous years. Finally, it is perhaps noteworthy that whenever
                            the question of increasing heavy industry production has been mentioned
                            in recent output, the phrases “within its proper proportions” or
                            “keeping in mind the particular conditions of our country” have
                            invariably been used.</p>
                        <p>The second charge, that Nagy and his followers ignored the problem of
                            raising productivity, decreasing prime costs, etc., is blatantly false.
                            These have been continuing major points of emphasis over the past nine
                            months and were, in fact, primary points in the October Central
                            Committee resolution and in Mr. <persName>Nagy</persName>’s confession
                            of faith as published in <hi rend="italic">Szabad Nep</hi> on October
                            20. In the latter, Mr. <persName>Nagy</persName> stated: “If the quality
                            of the product is inadequate, and if it is too expensive, we must call
                            ourselves to account. We must draw the final conclusion to produce more,
                            better and cheaper goods.” Nagy went even further in his November 19
                            speech, saying: “Our industry, our leaders and workers alike must make
                            further huge efforts in the constant raising of productivity. This must
                            be attained by eliminating slackness in work discipline . . . <note

                            which productivity should be raised, prime costs reduced, materials
                            spared, and waste eliminated.”</p>
                        <p>Although there is probably more substance in the accusations regarding
                            Mr. <persName>Nagy</persName>’s policies in the agricultural sector,
                            they cannot be fully supported by the facts, and where supported,
                            political, rather <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0057"/>than economic,
                            factors are more often than not drawn upon for support. Insofar as the
                            charge that he failed to carry on class warfare in the villages is
                            concerned, this is the sort of accusation which would be impossible to
                            prove or disprove, if only for the reason that “kulak” has become a
                            generic term for all opponents of the regime. It should be borne in
                            mind, however, that the land reform in Hungary was carried out under Mr.
                                <persName>Nagy</persName> while he was Minister of Agriculture, and
                            there has been nothing to indicate that he has changed his views about
                            this luckless section of the population who once owned more than 25
                            yokes of land. Mr. <persName>Nagy</persName> has, moreover, alluded many
                            times to the question of the peasant-worker alliance, always paying
                            tribute to the workers’ class by stating, as he did in his speech prior
                            to the council elections, that they “were the leading force, the
                            organizing and uniting power of the people’s gigantic efforts.” Finally,
                            if Mr. <persName>Nagy</persName> failed to encourage the development of
                            collective farming, it was due primarily to the unanimous decision of
                            the Central Leadership, supported by Mr. <persName>Rakosi</persName>, to
                            permit peasants to leave collective farms, which was one of the major
                            reforms announced at the inception of the “June Course”, and not one
                            evolving later as a result of any deviationism. The socialization of
                            agriculture has continued to be pointed to as a major long-range
                            objective even during the New Course period. The fault here might be
                            said to rest in the fact that it was not pushed with sufficient zeal to
                            overcome the strong antipathy of the Hungarian peasant. In short,
                            coercion was abandoned, which again was a result of politically, rather
                            than economically, based factors.</p>
                        <p>It is believed, therefore, that it can be said that the main charges
                            against Mr. <persName>Nagy</persName> which have an economic base are
                            largely without foundation and that they would not have been
                            sufficiently strong in themselves to have supported, even on communist
                            terms, the serious charge of “right deviationism” leveled against him.
                            It would have been understandable had Mr. <persName>Nagy</persName> been
                            accused of inefficiency, for there can be no doubt that everything said
                            in the resolution about the present state of the Hungarian economy can
                            be easily justified, including the charge that the New Course has been a
                            complete failure economically. Had the charges gone no further than
                            this, it is conceivable that Mr. <persName>Nagy</persName> might have
                            been persuaded to withdraw gracefully in the manner of Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MGM1">Malenkov</persName>, thereby tempering the shock
                            on Western public opinion, and, more importantly, on Hungarian public
                            morale.</p>
                        <p>Against this background, we are more and more inclined to believe that
                            the dominant factors in the local situation are politically grounded and
                            that they bear directly on basic communist dogma itself. As mentioned
                            above, we have been greatly impressed by the tone and content of output
                            bearing on the fourth and final charge against Mr.
                                <persName>Nagy</persName>, namely, that he underestimated the
                            achievements of the Party <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0058"/>and
                            under-emphasized the Party’s leading role. We see in this charge
                            relating to communist dogma three separate facets: (1) the role of the
                            Party in a communist society, (2) the rights and responsibilities of the
                            individual within the framework of the Party’s role, and (3) the extent
                            of an individual’s and a nation’s independence relative to the system
                            (the latter including the growth of liberal and nationalist tendencies
                            with undertones of Titoism).</p>
                        <p>Regarding point (1), we believe there has been a conflict within the
                            Hungarian Workers’ Party between those forces led by Nagy, who
                            considered that the Party should merely give general policy directives
                            to the Government and allow the Government to work out the details, and
                            those led by Rakosi, who maintained that the Party should be permitted
                            to direct the day-to-day administration of the country in every sphere,
                            from the Ministerial level down to the organization of production in
                            factories. Attached hereto as Enclosure No. 1 is a series of excerpts
                            from speeches and articles which relate to this issue of the role of the
                                Party.<note n="4" xml:id="d13fn4">Enclosed with this despatch, but
                                not printed, were eight translations of articles from newspapers,
                                editorials, and speeches by party officials critical of Nagy and his
                                policies from March 4 to March 21.</note> They cover the gamut of
                            relations between the Party and mass organizations such as the local
                            councils, the trade unions, the Patriotic People’s Front, the press,
                            etc., and, it is believed, point up and provide a considerable amount of
                            evidence that this basic tenet of communist dogma has figured very
                            heavily in the recent crisis.</p>
                        <p>Regarding point (2), the ideological conflict here appears to have been
                            well summarized by Mr. <persName>Nagy</persName> himself when in his
                            October speech he stated: “Socialism can be built only if the working
                            people are granted more rights and freedoms, as well as increasing
                            material welfare.” This element bears heavily on Party discipline and
                            accounts, we believe, for Deputy Foreign Minister Sik’s recent remark
                            that Nagy “went to excess—he exaggerated”. The growth of liberal
                            tendencies, conspicuous in the increased freedom with which individuals
                            and the press expressed criticism of Party policies and personalities,
                            and in the greatly lessened police pressure, obviously ran counter to
                            established dogma. This “opportunism” appears to have been looked upon
                            as an insidious growth which could not be permitted to spread in Hungary
                            because of its harmful effects throughout the bloc.</p>
                        <p>The third facet, the extent of an individual’s and nation’s independence
                            relative to the system, constitutes, in our view, the most significant
                            issue. At point here is whether it is permissible for a satellite
                            country to develop along the road to socialism taking into account its
                            own capacities and capabilities, and, more importantly, profit by
                            mistakes previously made, or whether it must, perforce, tread the same
                            path and go through the same contortions as the Glorious <pb n="29"
                                xml:id="pg_29" facs="0059"/>Leader. There is, it is believed, ample
                            evidence in the attached extracts to indicate that Nagy took a firm
                            stand in favor of the former proposition and that this issue constitutes
                            the core of the “right deviationism” charge brought against him. Two
                            more recent editorials in <hi rend="italic">Szabad Nep</hi> have taken
                            the veil off this key issue and exposed it more clearly than did either
                            the resolutions or earlier output. On April 8, <hi rend="italic">Szabad
                                Nep</hi> in an article, the purpose of which was said to be to draw
                            readers’ attention to the roots and dangers of “right deviation” stated:
                            “ . . . The rightist deviationists endeavor to underestimate the
                            importance of the Soviet Union and of the People’s Democracies in the
                            development of this country. Instead of realizing the importance of the
                            fact that we are members of the peace camp, they used high falutin’
                            words in connection with nationalism. In other words, rightist views do
                            not refer only to some minor details, but affect the whole policy of our
                            Party. In their articles and speeches and in practical life, the
                            supporters of rightist deviationism have revised the Leninist program of
                            socialist construction and have substituted it by another one. If we
                            analyze the rightist views, we clearly see that they were aimed,
                            willy-nilly, at making the Party deviate from its road, the road
                            followed by the Soviet Union—and at making Hungary follow another, a
                            specifically Hungarian road that was supposed to lead to socialism.
                            There is only one road leading to the building of socialism and that is
                            the road followed by the Soviet Union . . . ”</p>
                        <p>Again, on May 4, <hi rend="italic">Szabad Nep</hi> published an article
                            commenting on the “Textbook of Political Economy” published last fall in
                            Russia and recently translated into Hungarian, which was most revealing
                            on this point. It stated: “The special chapter [on the People’s
                                Democracies]<note n="5" xml:id="d13fn5">Brackets in the source
                                text.</note> has furthermore been written on account of the fact
                            that in the countries of the People’s Democracies the period of the
                            transitory phase has not yet ended, and therefore the legal precepts of
                            this period can only be studied in its purest form by the example set in
                            the Soviet Union . . . in the most essential points the rightist
                            deviationists have rejected the methods of the building of socialism
                            which have proved a success in the Soviet Union and have suggested a
                            different road to follow instead . . . ”</p>
                        <p>Herein would appear to lie what might be termed “the seeds of Titoism”.
                            One sentence of Rakosi’s speech delivered before Budapest Party
                            activists on March 13 would appear finally to confirm that the orders to
                            reverse the New Course came from without Hungary and strongly to suggest
                            why they came and why Rakosi, the doctrinaire, was given the support
                            necessary to overcome the preponderant forces rallied around Mr.
                                <persName>Nagy</persName>, both in the Party and in the countryside,
                            and to oust him from power—“Until the summer of 1953”, Rakosi said, <pb
                                n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0060"/>“nobody thought of discovering a
                            gap in the structure of the peace front of 900 million people. Since
                            then, however, glances of growing hope have been cast in the direction
                            of Hungary.” In other words, Hungary had exposed herself as a weak spot
                            politically in Moscow’s otherwise firm and uniform control of the bloc
                            Governments and drastic action was required to mend this breach and to
                            reverse the trends which brought it about.</p>
                        <p>It is our conviction that the Rakosi faction encountered much greater
                            difficulty in gaining acceptance of the March resolution than
                            anticipated either by it or by Moscow, and that when the strength of the
                            Nagy following became clearly apparent, there was not only considerable
                            vacillation both here and in Moscow, but a decision was actually taken
                            to modify tactics if Nagy could be persuaded to cooperate. This, we
                            believe, accounts for the long interval between the first public
                            condemnation of Nagy (March 9) and his final ouster (April 18). This
                            time was taken advantage of by Rakosi to hold meetings all over the
                            country in an effort to justify his action and gain acceptance of it by
                            the Party’s rank and file and, concomitantly, to attempt to persuade
                            Nagy to recant. That this latter effort was made is supported by reports
                            from reliable sources that two separate delegations, the last of which
                            included a high-ranking Russian, visited Nagy for this purpose, and by
                            later press admissions that even after the March 9 denunciation Nagy
                            “continued to display an anti-Party attitude”. Nagy’s stubborn refusal
                            to follow <persName corresp="#p_MGM1">Malenkov</persName>’s example
                            accounts, we believe, for the comparatively severe action finally taken
                            against him. It is perhaps noteworthy in this connection, however, that
                            despite the severity of the language and charges contained in the April
                            18 indictment against Nagy, there is as yet no indication that he has
                            been or will, in the near future, be brought to trial, which may, in
                            itself, be indicative of the latent strength of the Nagy faction.</p>

                        <p>An evaluation of the new leadership can probably best be made against a
                            stock-taking of policies it has pursued and actions that it has taken
                            since assuming responsibility for Government in early March. The
                            Legation has just completed a review covering the industrial,
                            agricultural and private sectors of the economy in its Despatch #337 of
                            May 11.<note n="6" xml:id="d13fn6">Not printed. (Department of State,
                                Central Files, 864.00/5–1155)</note> The conclusion reached is that
                            in these sectors actions which have been taken add up to a new policy,
                            but it is clear, at the same time, that this new policy is not what
                            regime propaganda attempts to make it appear, particularly in the
                            industrial sector. Here it is not a return to heavy industry, which it
                            is said to be; nor does it appear to be a logical plan for improving
                            industrial efficiency prior to establishing <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31"
                                facs="0061"/>new long-range output goals for the second Five-Year
                            Plan. It seems rather to be an effort to stave off, for at least a short
                            period of time, the ever-increasing chaos and growing economic and
                            financial problems through the use of labor competitions, firing of
                            “non-productive” workers, reduction of illegal wage payments, etc. while
                            undertaking measures to close the breach on the political front.</p>
                        <p>In agriculture, the stated policy coincides more closely with action
                            taken. The objective is to push socialization of agriculture, and the
                            two primary methods being used are pressure of all kinds on the peasant
                            to force him back into collectives and actions aimed at curtailing the
                            tendency of both cooperative members and private peasants to engage in
                            capitalistic or speculative activities.</p>
                        <p>New measures have also been instituted to force back the private
                            enterprise sector, the growth of which during the past year and a half
                            has been a striking example of the liberalism prevailing under the Nagy
                            regime. (All of these measures are discussed in greater detail in the
                            Legation’s despatch under reference.)</p>
                        <p>A close analysis of the actions which have been taken in the above three
                            fields, however, has convinced us that the regime is currently pursuing
                            a course here which, for the moment at least, is dictated primarily by
                            political, rather than economic aims, and which might even be said to
                            have been chosen despite the prospects of rather meager economic
                            results. In short, the current trend in these three fields appears to
                            have as its aim the restoration of a desired political atmosphere,
                            whatever its effects on the economy of Hungary. This conclusion adds
                            considerable force to the theory propounded above that the dominant
                            factors in the local situation are politically grounded.</p>
                        <p>In the purely political sphere, the following are the more significant

                            towards harshness, with the use of more coercive, restrictive and

                        <p>Against this background the temptation is to conclude that the current
                            leaders of Hungary have unanimously chosen a one-way, four-lane highway
                            leading back to pure Stalinism. However, we do not believe that this is
                            the case. We are strongly of the opinion that it is not the intention of
                            even the most diehard doctrinaires to attempt to turn the clock back two
                            years or that there is even now unanimity in the leadership regarding
                            the right course for Hungary in these critical times. Measures taken
                            thus far have, we believe, been dictated by Rakosi, with the support of
                            Moscow, with the aim of shearing off quickly and decisively some of the
                            more potentially dangerous political outcroppings of the Nagy era—to
                            restore a more desirable political climate from the standpoint of the
                            doctrinaires, a climate in which Hungarians will be less susceptible to
                            influences coming from outside the bloc and less willing to expose
                            themselves in lending support to Nagy personally or to policies which he
                            stood for and which have now been branded as being too Hungarian and
                            tacitly acknowledged as running counter to established communist
                            dogma.</p>
                        <p>The sequence of events and several incidents which came to light during
                            the protracted interval between Nagy’s public denunciation and his
                            dismissal revealed quite clearly the strength of the Nagy faction in
                            Hungary not only in the countryside (where it is believed preponderant)
                            but in the top echelons of the Party itself. We are inclined to believe
                            that it was the appreciation of this fact on the part of the
                            doctrinaires and the employment of it by the moderates which led to the
                            selection of Andras Hegedus as the new Prime Minister. We look upon
                            Hegedus as a compromise candidate, a man, who because of his peasant
                            background and his position as Minister of Agriculture under Nagy, was
                            more acceptable both to the Nagy faction within the Party and to the
                            peasantry than someone more closely associated in the public mind with
                            the doctrinaire element or with an overtly anti-peasant policy. He was,
                            at the same time, probably considered acceptable to the doctrinaires
                            because of the debt he doubtless owes Rakosi for his rather spectacular
                            rise and as it is considered that he could be bent to Rakosi’s will when
                            vital issues are at stake.</p>
                        <p>The fact that Hegedus seems to have been a compromise candidate does not
                            of itself mean that future policy of the regime will similarly be a
                            compromise policy. Policy will undoubtedly be governed during the coming
                            months by the objective of restoring political stability and removing
                            the budding liberalism of the Nagy era on the one hand and the virility
                            of the opposition to whatever course is taken on the other. The
                            immediate political objectives must be considered of real urgency by
                            Rakosi and his followers if, as seems to be the case, they are willing
                            to forego economic improvement for the time being. It <pb n="33"
                                xml:id="pg_33" facs="0063"/>might, therefore, be concluded that the
                            doctrinaire element might be prepared to take rather extreme measures to
                            attain its immediate ends in the political field. On the other hand, the
                            reaction throughout the countryside to new tactics cannot be ignored
                            either, and it seems quite probable that reaction and opposition will
                            grow stronger as regime policy toughens.</p>
                        <p>It seems to us that what is now developing might be characterized as a
                            “dash back to more secure ground”, which will continue until solid
                            ground has been reached or at least until what might be called the
                            political quagmire of Nagyism has been escaped. Once this objective has
                            been attained—if indeed it can be—it may be that the doctrinaires under
                            the figurehead of Hegedus will attempt to steer a middle-of-the-road
                            course between the “excessive” liberalism of Nagy on the one hand and
                            the pre-1953 harshness of the doctrinaires on the other. They would
                            probably also at this time attempt to give more serious attention to the
                            running sore of Hungary’s economic problems.</p>
                        <p>Needless to say, all of this will, in any event, be contingent upon the
                            absence of great changes within the USSR’s domestic situation and upon
                            the absence of significant modifications in the tension between East and
                            West, either of which could have effects within Hungary which might well
                            outweigh the internal factors discussed above.</p>

                        <p>On May 14, the Soviet Union and the Eastern European Communist nations
                            formed a security arrangement with the signing of a multilateral treaty
                            of “friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance” at Warsaw. The pact
                            was subsequently ratified by all signatories on May 30. The general
                            perception in the United States Government of the Warsaw Pact was that
                            it was an interim arrangement of tactical significance in East-West
                            relations. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> briefed

                                (Department of State, Central Files, 760.00/6–1055)</note> In case
                            of Poland, not only is geographic location factor, but in all
                            probability Soviets are determined to take no chances whatsoever that
                            Belgrade talks might result in too close a rapprochement between Poland
                            and Yugoslavia. Soviets have always attached maximum importance to
                            control of Poland in view of its geographic location between Soviet
                            Union and Germany, together with full knowledge of character of Polish
                            people and traditional anti-Russian feelings. So far in Soviet press
                            comment on Belgrade talks there has been no specific mention whatsoever
                            of any direct effect upon Polish-Yugoslav relations. Absence of similar
                            reference to Yugoslav-Albania relations and fact that Albanians were not
                            summoned Bucharest is noticeable possibly for opposite reasons. Of all
                            satellites, Albania is more directly affected by Soviet-Yugoslav
                            rapprochement and it is not by any means impossible that during Belgrade
                            talks there was some measure of Soviet recognition of Yugoslavia’s
                            special position with regard to Albania, such as I believe existed prior
                            to 1948. Both in communiqués issued after Sofia visit and picked up in

                            exactly what Soviets have in mind in regard to these countries but this
                            aspect has been singled out for special press attention and may forecast

                            conference.</p>
                        <p>With regard to satellite problem, I continue to believe that Soviets are
                            in process, of which Belgrade talks are a part, of seeking more stable
                            and permanent basis of relations with satellites in light existing <pb
                                n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0066"/>circumstances. The purpose is
                            obviously not willingly to lose control over European satellites, but on
                            contrary to make certain readjustments based on more realistic
                            assessment of current situation since Stalin’s death in order to retain
                            maximum degree of such influence and control.</p>
                        <p>As indicated in beginning of this message, I am inclined to believe that
                            Soviets in this process will make distinction between various satellites
                            depending upon their relative importance to Soviet security, degree of
                            reliability from Soviet point of view and other factors. It is too soon
                            to attempt any definite conclusion as to what final outcome this process
                            may be and most that can be done at this juncture is to keep this
                            subject under close observation.</p>
                        <p>On Far East, we have noted and reported that Chinese press approval to
                            Belgrade talks has been cited and picked up editorially by Soviet press,
                            and of course, official Yugoslav association with Soviet position on
                            admission China to United Nations and Formosa issue is gain for Soviet
                            bloc, as already observed in Soviet eyes rapprochement with Yugoslavia
                            may reduce possibility of developments damaging to Soviet prestige or
                            interest in Yugoslav-Chinese relationship.</p>
                        <p>We have not [garble] from here on possible effect Soviet-Yugoslavian
                            relations on Western Communist parties since evidence on that score is
                            more readily ascertainable elsewhere. However, healing of heretical
                            breach with Tito, even at possibly greater price than Soviets intended
                            to pay, will certainly not be damaging to advantage of Communist cause
                            as whole although possible to degree Moscow control.</p>
                        <p>There have been so far no developments here which would indicate any
                            personnel factor within Soviet leadership as result Belgrade visit, and
                            it is doubtful any such signs will be quickly apparent.</p>
                        <p>Entire leadership was present at airport on return of delegation and were
                            present last night at Bolshoi gala performance and everyone seemed in
                            normal positions. In general, however, we are inclined to believe that
                            conduct of Soviet delegation at Belgrade, and particular fact that
                            declaration was signed by <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                                >Bulganin</persName> and not <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>, is further sign that up to present at least
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has not acquired
                            position of personal dominance to point where his will alone determines
                            Soviet policy, and that in effect collective leadership, with all its
                            inherent elements of instability and division applies.</p>
                        <p>From his remarks to Riddleberger, which were similar to those made to
                            American correspondent, I am informed, here during Czech reception in
                            May, it would appear that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>, as things now stand, will not attend
                            four-power conference. While delegation probably not yet determined,
                            most likely composition would be <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                                >Bulganin</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>
                            and possibly <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> from among
                            top leaders.</p>

                            affairs. The Embassy will endeavor to obtain all information available,
                            prior to the Four Power meeting in July, which will assist the

                            and how we can take advantage of the present fluidity of Soviet
                            diplomacy to promote the cause of freedom in Czechoslovakia.</p>
                        <p>Our preliminary analysis of the effect of recent developments on the
                            Czechoslovak Government is disappointing. The present regime is beset
                            with economic difficulties, but there is little reason to hope that any
                            member of the Party or Government hierarchy will make any independent
                            economic or political move without clearance by Moscow. Present
                            leadership is stable, docile and unambitious. There does not appear to
                            be any split in the central leadership, as has been reported to be the
                            case in Hungary, and it may be expected that all words and actions in
                            Prague will parrot the Moscow line. The central leadership is completely
                            dependent upon Moscow for its survival and there seems to be no one with
                            enough popular support, ambition or courage to organize or inspire
                            independent thought or action.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the people, their hopes for a slackening of rigidity of
                            the chains binding them to Moscow have no doubt been increased by the
                            Soviet gestures toward the Yugoslavs and the West Germans. Discontent
                            has unquestionably been sharpened by Soviet overtures to two of the
                            governments which for years they have been instructed to hate. We have
                            found, however, no overt manifestations of disaffection aside from
                            expressions of discontent in private conversations. Our limited contacts
                            with the people reveal interest in current developments <pb n="38"
                                xml:id="pg_38" facs="0068"/>with the hope that the Soviet retreat
                            will somehow result in favorable changes in Czechoslovakia. However,
                            there is no disposition to assume risks and popular attitude appears
                            passive.</p>
                        <p>Given this situation we consider it very unlikely that pressures from
                            within will bring about any dramatic changes in this country at the
                            present time. If the present Soviet tactics have any repercussions here
                            they will be slow in coming and gradual in effect. If Soviet-Yugoslav
                            relations eventually force a change in Soviet policy in the Satellites,
                            Czechoslovakia will follow the lead of others but it will not take the
                            initiative.</p>
                        <p>This pessimistic viewpoint is not shared by Ivo Vejvoda, the Yugoslav
                            Ambassador in Prague. Since he knows the Czechs better perhaps than any
                            other diplomat stationed here and has many contacts with both the
                            government and the people, his views cannot be discounted. On the other
                            hand, he held an important position in the Foreign Ministry in Belgrade
                            in the 1948–1950 period and no doubt played a part in formulating
                            policies which have so recently been proven themselves. He has been
                            exhilarated by recent events and because of his enthusiasm may
                            over-emphasize their impact here.</p>
                        <p>The day after <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s airport
                                speech<note n="5" xml:id="d17fn5">See <ref target="#d15">Document
                                    15</ref>.</note> Vejvoda informed us of the profound effect it
                            had had on both the government and the people. When discussing the
                            subject he repeats the adjectives “enormous” and “tremendous”. In
                            government offices he claims to have heard bureaucrats repeating
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s phrases “dear
                            comrade Tito” and “sincerely regret” in jocular tones. He also tells a
                            story of a factory meeting which occurred after <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s arrival speech and states
                            that the source of the story is one of the highest trade union
                            functionaries. As he tells it, a factory party secretary was being
                            severely criticized at a meeting for many short-comings. In desperation
                            the secretary defended himself by saying, “Don’t blame me, I was misled
                            by Beria and Abakumov.” Everyone laughed and the meeting adjourned
                            without taking disciplinary action against the secretary. Vejvoda also
                            claims that middle and lower level party leaders are in a quandary as
                            they are being asked embarrassing questions by the rank and file and are
                            receiving no policy guidance from the top.</p>
                        <p>Cepicka, Novotny and Dolansky attended a recent diplomatic reception and
                            were engaged in serious conversation with Vejvoda for approximately half
                            an hour. He has not related the substance of this conversation to any of
                            my staff and I have not yet had an opportunity to discuss the matter
                            with him. However, he has alluded to the interest with which the Czech
                            leaders read the joint declaration on future relations, especially those
                            sentences concerning respect for sovereignty, compliance with the
                            principle of non-interference in internal <pb n="39" xml:id="pg_39"
                                facs="0069"/>affairs and recognition of different forms of socialist
                            development. It is doubted that Cepicka, Novotny, Dolansky or any other
                            present leader wants independence or freedom from Soviet control; and,
                            although Vejvoda has never alleged that they do, he implies that they
                            have been influenced by the respect shown his country by the Soviet
                            Union.</p>
                        <p>One would assume that if the present Czech regime had an ounce of
                            gumption it would have strong reservations concerning recent Soviet
                            overtures to the German Federal Republic. If Czech leaders were in fact
                            shocked, surprised, or disappointed at the Soviet overtures, their
                            feelings were not revealed in the controlled press. All papers on June 9
                            carried leading articles on the subject of Czech-German relations and
                            all expressed satisfaction with the Soviet gesture of June 7.</p>

                            interesting confirmation provided recently to reliable Western colleague
                            by East German Ambassador Heymann, who stated that since reunification
                            impossible for long time, two Germanys “should” have relations, and that
                            he consequently “welcomed” invitation <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41"

                            Moscow. Statement particularly interesting from standpoint that
                            satellites, including East Germany, will presumably follow Moscow’s lead
                            promptly in attempting establish relations West Germany when and if
                            Soviet-West German relations become fact. Embassy has heard this
                            connection that some Poles fear <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                                >Adenauer</persName> trip to Moscow may result in Soviet offer
                            return some “recovered” territories to Germany. Department has probably
                            already foreseen problem which would arise if USSR, having established
                            relations West Germany, would insist inviting both West Germany and East
                            Germany (which Western countries have refused recognize) to conference
                            on reunification.</p>
                        <p>Warsaw Treaty: Although Warsaw eight-power treaty ratified by all
                            signatories, no news here of any steps toward practical implementation.
                            This would seem indicate assumption correct that none is necessary (all
                            practical details assumed to have been already in force when pact
                            signed) and that therefore treaty is mere legalistic confirmation for
                            possible negotiating purposes.</p>
                        <p>General: Some private Poles have expressed disappointment that West,
                            particularly US, has lost diplomatic offensive to USSR during period
                            starting with Soviet visit Belgrade. Sources inclined view Soviet moves
                            as carefully calculated, calmly executed maneuvers and to miss apparent
                            fact that Soviets have been forced to these actions by trend of events
                            regarding regaining sovereignty and rearming West Germany.</p>
                        <p>Embassy agrees with idea already advanced some commentators that same
                            trend events might eventually cause USSR to offer “neutrality belt” of
                            satellite states in return for similar “neutrality belt” contiguous
                            Western countries. Reliability such offer obviously open to
                            question.</p>
                        <p>Judging by way it is being attacked in Polish press, US “policy of
                            strength” is great success.</p>

                            <item>Another striking development of current period is play given to
                                statements by the President and Secretary concerning our
                                unwillingness to accept as final satellite regimes. In this play-up,
                                advantage is taken of fear of Poles (not merely Communist party
                                followers) of a resurgent, rearmed Germany. Line taken is that USA
                                desires replacement of present regime in Poland by one which would
                                permit reopening of Oder-Neisse Western boundary and East Prussia
                                questions and return of some part at least of these areas to
                                Germany. No intimation is given in these radio and press play-ups
                                that USSR, if it goes along with rapprochement with West German
                                Republic, and ultimately with German reunification, will likewise be
                                confronted with German demands over frontier Silesia and East
                                Prussia. Likewise play-ups are silent on known Polish desires for
                                return of Soviet held Wilno and Lwow areas. On balance we believe

                                well-known. We have noted here recently similar strong feelings of
                                diplomatic representatives of Norway, Sweden, and Finland,
                                especially if future German Army is to be trained by some former
                                German generals mentioned to head that army. Finnish diplomatic
                                officer, one of few who have driven from Berlin to Warsaw, was
                                shocked by “arrogance” of Eastern military unit in forcing all
                                traffic “in the ditch” while its cavalcade roared by. There is some
                                feeling among Scandinavian representatives that Silesian industrial
                                area (Europe’s second Ruhr) would for world peace and security be
                                better under Polish control than resurgent Germany’s. Point here is
                                that these pro-Western diplomats sympathize with Polish fear and may
                                help abolish it in their more frequent talks with Polish

                                goodwill of Polish people. Its favoritism toward youth and workers
                                is well-known—holidays, tours, bonuses, et cetera—ridiculous in
                                Western eyes but may be not so ridiculous to younger generations.
                                Strong efforts to play-up to cherished Polish accomplishments in
                                art, music, literature, national monuments and the like (Chopin
                                festival and rebuilding of Warsaw shrines). Even in police and
                                prison terrorism, there seems to be some alleviation. Recent report
                                of Jewish prisoner released to emigrate to Palestine reveals that
                                prison life has improved greatly in past year and more prisoners

                                here. Veteran diplomats have commented on size of crowd who lined
                                streets to greet Nehru—larger they say than crowds hitherto greeting
                                such celebrities as <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"

                                that some Poles see in Nehru possible neutral spokesman in power
                                struggle between USA and USSR. If this be true, regime might lean
                                toward neutral status for Poland (and other satellites) in return
                                for neutral Germany with Nehru as “salesman”. He could help sell
                                theirs and Moscow’s brand of coexistence. Apparently this is the
                                role Nehru has been fishing for in this area. At least Nehru seems
                                to have captured good share of Polish “imagination” as well as much

                            working group, made up of representatives of France, the United Kingdom,
                            and the United States, raised as a possible topic at Geneva the question
                            of the Soviet Union’s domination of Eastern Europe. In planning meetings
                            in Paris on July 9, the French suggested that while the satellite issue
                            was important, it should not stand in the way of agreement on other
                            matters. The British doubted whether the Soviet Union would agree to
                            consider the satellite question realistically at Geneva and favored
                            dealing with proposals for broader exchange of persons and ideas as the
                            best means for change in the Soviet bloc. The United States reiterated
                            the importance of maintaining pressure on the Soviet Union on the
                            satellite issue. (Telegram 128 from Paris, July 9; volume V, page

                        </list>
                        <p>During recent dinner conversation with former Ambassador Winiewicz, now
                            head American and Commonwealth sections of the Foreign Office (British
                            Ambassador present), the following points were discussed, which I
                            believe bear reporting:</p>
                        <p>While discussing the “Iron Curtain” on exchange between East and West of
                            views, ideas and developments in each area, which lends itself to
                            continuance of misunderstanding, misrepresentation and, above all, lack
                            of confidence, I mentioned that Polish radio jamming and ban on visits
                            of foreign correspondents was a great stumbling block in this field. I
                            mentioned that the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> Moscow
                            representative, Clifton Daniel, was astonished at certain things he saw
                            and found in Warsaw and had written an article in a somewhat favorable
                            vein on his visit. Winiewicz admitted there was truth in my observation
                            but said the subject was rather “touchy”, as non-Foreign Office
                            officials, whenever the matter is discussed, allege that correspondents,
                            especially American, come with pre-conceived ideas against the regime
                            and always report on the worst, seamy aspects of <pb n="50"
                                xml:id="pg_50" facs="0080"/>what they see and that, as regards
                            radio, everything broadcast is critical with never a word about
                            accomplishments. This attitude makes it very difficult for the Foreign
                            Office to raise the question without Foreign Office officials being
                            unjustly accused of pro-Western leanings.</p>
                        <p>I expect nothing will come of this conversation, but as more and more
                            American correspondents are applying for visas, my remarks may be a
                            helpful reminder to Winiewicz when such applications are being
                            considered.</p>
                        <p>During the conversation Winiewicz remarked that the “trouble” with
                            Westerners, especially Americans, is that they rarely, almost never,
                            appreciate the fact that the regime is not composed entirely of “agents
                            of Moscow” who do only Moscow’s bidding. He said that there are official
                            elements, one hundred percent Polish, who feel that, regardless of the
                            complexion of the regime, they, as patriotic Poles, must do what they
                            can in existing difficult circumstances for the good of the Polish
                            people.</p>
                        <p>He went on to say that the Polish people are not completely pawns of
                            Moscow and that a similar situation exists in other Soviet bloc
                            countries, mentioning Communist China particularly. He said there was an
                            awakening in Moscow to the fact that Moscow must give more consideration
                            to the nationalist aspirations of the various “so-called“ satellite
                            peoples.</p>
                        <p>I infer that Winiewicz’s point is that the West should do more to
                            encourage strictly nationalist elements in the satellite countries,
                            especially in Poland; and not damn everybody connected with the
                            regime.</p>
                        <p>The final observation of interest by Winiewicz was that, after so many
                            years’ residence abroad, in England and the United States, he and his
                            wife were very happy to be back in Poland, even though they had to live
                            in a small three-room apartment. He himself was amazed at some things
                            that had been accomplished during his absence.</p>
                        <p>Sir Andrew Noble’s chief contribution to the conversation was that the
                            great difficulty between the East and West at the moment is a lack of
                            trust and confidence on both sides. He said that we have no confidence
                            in Moscow and he was sure that Moscow had no confidence in the West. The
                            problem was to establish a more mutual basis of trust and good
                            faith.</p>

                            of <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>, Legation leans toward view
                            that unsteady balance does exist within Hungarian regime, reflecting
                            both internal problems and Moscow’s effort to play two themes
                            simultaneously pending future developments; and that Rakosi’s position,
                            while not necessarily tottering, must be less solid than before as
                            result surface rapprochement at Geneva and Yugoslav attitudes (cf Tito
                            speech at Karlovac).<note n="3" xml:id="d25fn3">In his speech at
                                Karlovac on July 27, Tito characterized the present Soviet
                                leadership as “new men who view world developments realistically,
                                who do not want to see various wrongs and errors repeated, but who
                                want to move along other paths”. Tito continued that the Soviet
                                leaders realized that Stalin’s policies were wrong and
                                counterproductive, accepted Yugoslavia as a true socialist country,
                                and had begun the normalization process with Belgrade. Tito hoped
                                that other Eastern European nations would follow the Soviet Union’s
                                example in their relations with Yugoslavia and castigated the
                                leaders of those nations, particularly Hungary, for failure to do
                                so. (<hi rend="italic">Soviet Affairs</hi>, August 1955, p. 9; <hi

                            characterized by surface amiability, still no official reaction to
                            approach on trade and problem areas, and no response to US protest re
                            employee arrests delivered July 1. Noted that four weeks have passed
                            since two-week definition of reasonable time for satisfactory answer to

                                that it was a part of a larger campaign of harassment against the

                        <p>In this situation we see that some problem may be posed by attempt to
                            reconcile two desiderata: A) To avoid creating impression that US bluff
                            been called, which not unlikely to become progressively stronger if no
                            follow-up made to note of July 1. B) To avoid impression of taking
                            desperate steps likely to exacerbate East-West relations, in face of US
                            attitudes expressed at highest levels in Geneva.</p>
                        <p>It occurs to us, however, even more strongly than before (Legtel
                                19),<note n="5" xml:id="d25fn5">In telegram 19, July 14, the

                            be effective without being harmful if put into context somewhat as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>Points could be emphasized, more in sorrow than in anger, that
                            simultaneously with expressions by <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                                >Bulganin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> at Geneva of desire for improved relations
                            and broader contacts between representatives of East and West, actions
                            of type mentioned are being taken by certain influential elements in
                            Hungary (obvious crack at Rakosi) which appear clearly designed to
                            worsen relations and limit contacts. That can only be presumed policies
                            underlying such actions will soon undergo change, as otherwise doubts
                            might be cast on sincerity of statements made by Soviet
                            leaders—something US would be most reluctant to have happen.</p>
                        <p>Such line would appear to implement action forecast in US note; still not
                            represent overt exacerbation of East-West, US-Hungary or even US-Hungary
                            Government relations per se; and perhaps be helpful in further
                            undermining position of most conspicuous symbol of pro-Stalinist,
                            anti-Western policies in Hungary. Meanwhile Legation could continue to
                            extent possible with efforts to examine problem areas in “spirit of
                            improving relations”, presumably less hampered in these efforts than
                            would be if official publicity and propaganda arsenal turned broadside
                            on Hungarian Government as such.</p>

                            Paris and London, and the U.S. High Commissioner in Bonn, it was decided
                            to delay any official approach because of the forthcoming West German

                            developments in Europe and, following ratification of the London–Paris
                            Agreements, the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> requested that a
                            plan of implementation be prepared. On June 14, 1955 the <gloss
                                target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> concluded that the original conditions
                            which had held the project in abeyance had changed sufficiently to
                            justify implementation of a Volunteer Freedom Corps, although on a
                            somewhat modified basis.<note n="5" xml:id="d26fn5">See the <gloss

                        <p>4. The plan of implementation developed by the <gloss target="#t_OCB1"
                                >OCB</gloss> would establish a smaller organization than that
                            generally understood to be envisaged in <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 143/2, although both the current project and the <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper would establish a modest and
                            austere program of cadre units for expansion in emergency. While <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 143/2 provides that diplomatic
                            approaches should be made to allied governments and to the Government of
                            the Federal Republic of Germany to enlist their advance concurrence, the
                                <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> plan, in view of the termination
                            of the occupation status of West Germany, calls for diplomatic action to
                            secure the concurrence of the German Government only, and that the U.K.
                            and French Governments simply be informed in advance. Further, <pb
                                n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0085"/>since the policy paper provides
                            that emphasis should be placed on exploiting the psychological aspects
                            of the project, the question may arise as to whether a program which
                            would not be given any special publicity until an appropriate future
                            time can be viewed as an adequate implementation of <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 143/2.</p>

                        <p>5. In view of the foregoing considerations, the <gloss target="#t_OCB1"
                                >OCB</gloss> recommends that the National Security Council amend
                            paragraph 4 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 143/2 to dispense
                            with the necessity of diplomatic approaches to obtain the concurrence of
                            the U.K. and French Governments, and that the current <gloss
                                target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> plan be considered an adequate
                            implementation in other respects in spite of the small size of the
                            organization and the change of emphasis away from psychological
                            exploitation in the current situation. In view of the implications that
                            the Four Power Conference and subsequent negotiations developing
                            therefrom might have for implementation of <gloss target="#t_VFC1"
                                >VFC</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> further
                            recommends that the Council concur as a matter of policy that timing for
                            initiating action be subject to the determination of the Secretary of
                            State in consultation with the Secretary of Defense.</p>
                        <p>6. Following action by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> and the
                            Secretary of State, the Department of Defense will make arrangements for
                            funding of this project by a Presidential determination and allotment of
                            monies, initially under the Kersten Amendment authority (Section 401
                            (a), MSA of 1954, as amended) to the Department of Defense and for
                            appropriate instructions to be issued to implement the program. Until
                            such time as the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> agrees that it
                            would be useful and proper to publicize <gloss target="#t_VFC1"
                                >VFC</gloss> the substance of the instructions should remain
                                classified.<note n="6" xml:id="d26fn6">The Kersten amendment, named
                                for Congressman Charles J. Kersten of Wisconsin, was attached to the
                                1951 Mutual Security Act and allocated $100 million in assistance to
                                escapees or residents of the Soviet Union or the Eastern European
                                satellites. The funds were to be used to organize them into military

                            <p>The Committee Report interwove the detailed plan and the analysis of
                                the feasibility of the <gloss target="#t_VFC1">VFC</gloss> proposal.
                                It admitted the unavailability of exact information on eligible
                                foreign nationals, then or in the future, but estimated 33,000
                                eligible “escapees” over the next four years. Analyzing the

                                Report gave extensive treatment to the psychological considerations
                                in the <gloss target="#t_VFC1">VFC</gloss> proposal. Emphasizing the

                                drawbacks, were dependent on and in proportion to the manner and

                                Freedom Corps should be established.” It provided that several
                                battalions of European anti-Soviet escapees, excluding Germans, but
                                including escapees from the USSR, should be trained by the U.S. Army
                                as cadre units for further development in case of an emergency.

                                and the U.S. High Commissioner in Bonn as to the attitude of the
                                foreign governments toward establishment of a <gloss

                                advocated delaying any official approach lest the West German
                                elections be affected adversely and later lest the approaching

                                On September 24, 1953, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> assigned
                                the coordinating responsibilities for <gloss target="#t_VFC1"
                                    >VFC</gloss> to the Operations Coordinating Board. In informal

                                reported on May 11, 1954 that it was still the consensus of U.S.
                                diplomatic and military representatives that <gloss target="#t_VFC1"
                                    >VFC</gloss> should be held in abeyance until the problem of
                                    <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss> was resolved and that
                                thereafter the plan might be reexamined in light of the then
                                existing factors. General <persName corresp="#p_CGWD1"
                                    >Crittenberger</persName> also reported on the developing Labor

                            <p>As of March 31, 1955, the LSO strength was 25,974 which is 1,556
                                under authorized strength. Slow recruitment and losses are laid to
                                the civilian nature of LSO coupled with the competition for manpower
                                from an expanding German industry, and the fact that no publicity
                                has been authorized in connection with the expansion. It is
                                estimated that an initial body of recruits could be drawn from the
                                LSOs who would volunteer and be qualified for <gloss
                                    target="#t_VFC1">VFC</gloss>, and that the much needed LSOs
                                could be brought up to strength by appropriate means. Since the LSOs
                                have a fine record of efficiency and morale, this source could
                                provide an initial <gloss target="#t_VFC1">VFC</gloss> cadre.</p>
                            <p>Since LSO performs service support and guard duty, the term “Labor
                                Service” is perhaps not fully descriptive. Nevertheless, because of
                                LSO’s abbreviated military training and civilian status, they can
                                not be considered as combat troops. Moreover, they are badly needed
                                in their present capacity.</p>
                            <p>On September 8, 1954, the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>
                                recommended to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> an expansion of
                                LSOs to not more than 1,000 former nationals of Soviet orbit
                                countries. This <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> action resulted
                                in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5435/1, “Expansion of the
                                Labor Service Organization in Germany”, which was approved by the
                                President on October 16, 1954. Recruiting for this expansion has
                                been slow. As of May 10, 1955, only 168 former Soviet nationals and
                                152 escapees from European satellites have been instated.</p>
                            <p>All LSO men must have German work permits. An escapee may never get a
                                work permit if he can not adequately identify himself to German
                                authorities. In the meantime, he may languish, for months or years,
                                in a <hi rend="italic">Lager</hi> such as Camp Valka. This condition
                                hardly induces escape from Iron Curtain countries. On the other
                                hand, escapees qualified for <gloss target="#t_VFC1">VFC</gloss>
                                could probably be enlisted without work permits, thus obviating a
                                major drawback to escape.</p>

                        <p>The following excerpt from the memorandum of the Secretary’s conversation
                            with the President on August 11, 1955, is forwarded to you for your
                            information.</p>
                        <p>“I expressed the view that the new atmosphere meant not a perpetuation of
                            the status quo but rather the greater opportunity for change. The
                            ‘security’ arguments of the Soviet Union had been downgraded and they
                            did not have the same justification of ‘security’ for holding on to East
                            Germany and the satellites. The important thing, I said, was to make it
                            perfectly clear that we did not identify increased hope of peace with
                            increased solidification of the status quo but rather the contrary, and
                            that we now expected there to be changes in the European situation, as
                            evidenced by the unification of Germany and greater freedom for the
                            satellites. I referred to my book ‘War, Peace and Change’ as indicating
                            my great belief that we could not have peace for long unless there was
                            peaceful change.</p>
                        <p>“The President expressed himself as in complete agreement with this
                            philosophy and said he felt it would fit well into a speech he was

                                concern to combat the perpetuation of injustices and wrongs,
                                particularly in the case of the Eastern European satellites, where,

                                “The domination of captive countries cannot longer be justified by

                        <p>At this early date it is difficult to assess in detail, or on a
                            documented basis, all implications of the Geneva Conference for the
                            audience of the U.S. information programs. Certain results of the Summit
                            meetings, however, are clearly of direct significance to American
                            information activities. The more important of these are: <list>

                                <item>An atmosphere of conciliation was created at Geneva resulting
                                    from the generally friendly tone struck by all participants, and
                                    the repeated stress on the urgency of international cooperation
                                    if a durable peace is to be achieved. In the eyes of the world,
                                    the United States emerged from the Summit Conference more
                                    clearly as a country dedicated to the earnest pursuit of
                                    peaceful solutions to international problems, sincerely willing
                                    to cooperate to this end even with the present rulers of the
                                    Soviet Union. This has been well received by most of our <pb

                                <item>At Geneva the Heads of Government of the Four Powers
                                    instructed their Foreign Ministers to undertake further
                                    discussions on a number of questions, beginning in October.
                                    Meanwhile, various disarmament proposals made at Geneva are to

                                    these discussions are scheduled in itself places a
                                    responsibility upon the U.S. Government information programs to
                                    avoid actions which in the eyes of the world might detract from
                                    the strong moral position achieved by the United States at
                                    Geneva. This must be kept in mind while carrying out the further
                                    responsibility of bringing pressure upon the Soviets, in advance
                                    of the October meeting so as either to induce them to make
                                    substantive concessions or make clear to the world their
                                    unwillingness to do so.</item>

                                <item>Despite their friendly tone at Geneva, Soviet leaders have as
                                    yet given no public evidence of their willingness to yield on
                                    any substantive issue brought up at Geneva. This fact is most
                                    obvious to our satellite audiences. The grip of the Soviet Union
                                    on its satellite empire remains firm; Soviet leaders have, in
                                    effect, publicly indicated that they do not at this time intend
                                    to relinquish effective control of the captive territories or
                                    peoples. Internal popular opposition to industrial and
                                    agricultural controls, combined with the new Soviet tolerance of
                                    the Titoist “heresy,” may well present the Soviet regime with
                                    increased difficulties. But the military forces of the
                                    Soviet-Communist bloc and the conspiratorial apparatus of
                                    international communism still represent an undiminished threat
                                    of great magnitude to the free world. Even though tensions which
                                    might lead to war in the near future have been relaxed, we can
                                    expect that communist tactics of subversion, economic
                                    penetration, insidious propaganda and political agitation will
                                    continue unabated. It is important therefore that superficial
                                    and possibly even a few substantial concessions which might be
                                    made at the subsequent conferences, be not looked upon as proof
                                    that the Soviet intentions have undergone any fundamental

                                        to the West. They undoubtedly have received an
                                        over-simplified impression of the readiness of the United
                                        States to cooperate with the present Soviet leaders, which
                                        will tend to increase feelings of hopelessness with regard
                                        to their eventual liberation from communism. This impression
                                        will give support to communist propaganda efforts to
                                        convince the Eastern European peoples that they cannot hope
                                        for effective intervention by the West.</p>
                                    <p>In the absence of any new evidence to the contrary, satellite
                                        peoples are apt to regard the apparent American acceptance
                                        of Soviet good faith either as political naivete, or as a
                                        first step toward abandonment of their interests. They are
                                        likely to feel that the manner in which the satellite
                                        question was dealt with at Geneva (including the failure of
                                        the British and French to support the President’s
                                        initiative) was weak and unconvincing in contrast to the
                                        strong and united Western position on German reunification.
                                        Latent suspicions regarding the sincerity of professed
                                        Western intentions to bring about the liberation of Eastern
                                        Europe have therefore probably been strengthened by
                                        developments at the Summit meetings. Perhaps the most
                                        significant aspect of Geneva for the captive peoples is the
                                        clear and unmistakable evidence that the Western powers,
                                        even the United States, will not resort to war, or threat of
                                        war, to liberate Eastern Europe. The resultant loss of hope,
                                        however unrealistic, for early liberation, by force if
                                        necessary, which is still widely held among the captive
                                        populations will undoubtedly lead to weakening of the spirit
                                        of resistance.</p>
                                    <p>On the other hand, Western proposals at Geneva for wider
                                        exchange of ideas, publications and persons offer a possible
                                        new approach to the satellite peoples. This approach would
                                        have to be combined with strong reassertions that political
                                        freedom and national independence must be restored to
                                        Eastern European countries. Precise and imaginative
                                        proposals for breaking down the isolation of the Eastern
                                        European people could be used to induce a gradual relaxation
                                        of communist controls, and to reduce the severity of the
                                        pressures now exercised upon individuals.</p>
                                    <p>Any official exchange program would risk suggesting that the
                                        U.S is reconciled to the status quo and is willing to confer
                                        respectability upon puppet leaders. Consequently such a
                                        program would have to be carefully presented to satellite
                                        audiences so as to avoid such an impression. But it would
                                        appear that the West stands to gain from wider circulation
                                        of Western ideas, books, magazines and newspapers, and from
                                        any reduction of radio jamming by the communists. A wider

                                        some risks. Satellite exchangees undoubtedly would be

                                        consist of hard core activists. Nonetheless, it might be <pb

                                <item>At Geneva it was asserted that the U.S. regards international
                                    communism as a major source of tension and that the Soviet Union
                                    is in a position to reduce this tension. Since Geneva there has
                                    been no indication that the conspiratorial activities of
                                    international communism have been reduced in any significant
                                    way, or that the leaders of the Soviet Union have ceased to
                                    exercise effective control over the international communist
                                    movement.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>As long as this situation continues, we cannot relax our efforts to
                            combat international communism with all effective means at our disposal,
                            and to make clear Soviet responsibility for communist efforts at
                            subversion, dissension and disorder throughout the world. Here a genuine
                            dilemma arises, at least for official U.S. information media. If we are
                            to be realistic about the source and control of the world-wide communist
                            conspiracy, we cannot avoid tracing responsibility to the Soviet Union,
                            and in certain contexts, to individual leaders of the Soviet Union—<hi
                                rend="italic">with whom we shall be negotiating over the next few
                                months</hi>. To what extent can the aims/motives and operations of
                            international communism be attacked and questioned, without reflecting
                            on the good faith and intentions of individual Soviet leaders? The
                            question of Soviet good faith and the aim of international communism to
                            dominate the world cannot be realistically separated. To resort to
                            euphemisms and circumlocutions in treating the problem of ultimate
                            responsibility can only result in a note of hypocrisy, which our
                            audiences will be quick to recognize.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps this dilemma can be partly obviated by directing our efforts at
                            inducing the Soviet leaders first to disavow publicly any connection
                            with international communist subversion and then to condemn such
                            activities.</p>
                        <p>Because Soviet leaders must, if confronted with the question, disavow any
                            official connection with the whole field of international communist
                            conspiracy and subversion, the dilemma referred to above may be more
                            apparent than real, since, if the Soviet leaders disavow such
                            activities, they cannot take umbrage at public attacks against those
                            activities.</p>
                        <p>It is, of course, too much to expect that we could induce the Soviet

                            subversion, but there would be value in obtaining their disavowal, even
                            though patently false, of any connection with international communist
                            subversion. Their mere disavowal of connection with the international
                            conspiracy would, since world public opinion knows they are directly
                            responsible for such conspiracy, condition public opinion to demand more
                            from the Soviet leaders than words on the substantive <pb n="76"

                            Furthermore, their refusal or failure to condemn communist subversive
                            activities would tend to become a glaring fact which could be widely
                            exploited.</p>

                            Approach</hi></p>
                        <p>The various considerations treated above emphasize the need for making
                            the position of the United States clear to the satellite peoples as we
                            approach the forthcoming meetings. Briefly, we do not consider that the
                            relaxation of tension and a more peaceful atmosphere permit us either to
                            scrap programs for individual and collective self defense, or to
                            tolerate covert aggression and to sanctify the injustices of the status
                            quo. Rather the spirit of Geneva means an opportunity for peaceful
                            change which will dispel fear and remedy injustices. Therefore, if the
                            atmosphere of Geneva is perverted by the Soviet leaders either into a
                            cover for covert aggression, or into an excuse for perpetuating present
                            injustices either at home or in the captive countries, then that
                            atmosphere cannot continue.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, at this moment in history, we cannot afford to appear,
                            in the eyes of the world, as condemning all offers of the Soviet Union
                            even before testing for sincerity. We should emphasize the positive
                            aspects of U.S. policies. We should not emphasize direct charges and
                            allegations against the Soviet Union, but rather we should make such
                            points by indirection.<note n="3" xml:id="d29fn3">The last sentence of

                        <p>We should closely follow developments in the satellites and elsewhere,
                            drawing attention to any failures by the Soviet or satellite regimes to
                            live up to the peaceful protestations made by Soviet leaders at Geneva,
                            and to their subsequent exhortations to put the “spirit of Geneva” into
                            practice. Our output should reflect the fact that the U.S. reciprocates
                            the present Soviet attitude and demeanor of conciliation. But we should
                            make clear that a continuation of the present atmosphere depends upon
                            Soviet and satellite actions which clearly show their willingness to
                            bring about a peaceful change. This means the elimination of the present
                            injustices under which the captive peoples suffer, and the curbing of
                            the conspiratorial activities of International Communism.</p>

                                <p>We should on suitable occasions restate our basic position on the
                                    satellites, namely that Soviet domination of the peoples of
                                    Eastern Europe is one of the major sources of East-West tension,
                                    and that the continuation of this control obstructs the
                                    achievement of genuine peace. We hold that the captive peoples
                                    must be given political freedom and national independence. A

                                    this position clearly and strongly, and to point up the fact
                                    that at Geneva the United States did <hi rend="italic">not</hi>

                                <p>We should not hesitate to comment objectively, and where
                                    appropriate, unfavorably, on internal developments in satellite
                                    countries, such as the agricultural crisis of the communist
                                    bloc, even when such comment reflects directly on the actions of
                                    the Soviet Government, or of top Soviet leaders. We may utilize
                                    anniversaries of past Soviet actions, such as the Hitler-Stalin
                                    pact or the Soviet takeover of the various satellite states, to
                                    point up past communist duplicity and ultimate Soviet
                                    responsibility for the imposition of an alien rule upon
                                    unwilling Eastern European peoples. This should be done without
                                    engaging in polemics, name-calling or personal attack on Soviet

                                <p>We should also invite attention to actions and statements by both
                                    Soviet and satellite regimes since the Geneva meeting which
                                    conflict with Soviet declarations that the spirit of Geneva must
                                    be put into practice. Should satellite regimes take a more
                                    conciliatory approach in East-West relations, or should they
                                    relax oppressive controls over their people, such moves should
                                    be welcomed as essential first steps, and further steps in this
                                    direction encouraged. We should point out, however, that such
                                    actions do not come anywhere near satisfying the legitimate
                                    spiritual and material demands of the satellite peoples, and
                                    that much more can and should be done.</p></item>

                                    political status. We should stress the fact that the American
                                    government and people expect some developments along these lines
                                    from Soviet leaders, and are watching closely for signs of

                                    newspapers, by exchange of personal visits, and by elimination
                                    of communist jamming of Western radio programs. This should be
                                    done without suggesting our acceptance of the status quo. We

                            the fact that West Germany had become a sovereign state meant that the
                            United States must secure the agreement of the German Government before
                            implementing plans for a Volunteer Freedom Corps. The reasons for the
                            delay in seeking the consent of the West German Government were
                            three-fold: the Geneva meeting at the summit; the forthcoming meeting of
                            the Foreign Ministers at Geneva; and Chancellor <persName

                                Files, 611.64/9–2555)</note> on the occasion of the 10th anniversary
                            of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the US and Hungary.
                            He stated that he had been instructed by his Government to approach the
                            Department of State on this important anniversary and to make known the
                            earnest hope of his Government that the occasion would mark the opening
                            of a decade of good relations with the US. The Minister said he was
                            aware that there were many outstanding problems in the relations of the
                            two countries but was confident that these issues could be resolved
                            during this period. He referred to initiatives already undertaken in
                            Budapest looking toward this end and then expressed the hope that the US
                            would find it possible, in furtherance of good relations, to support
                            Hungary’s application for membership in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BW1">Barbour</persName> said that he
                            appreciated the Minister’s statement of the views of the Hungarian
                            Government in these matters. He said he thought he should say frankly
                            that there were, indeed, many serious problems outstanding between the
                            US and Hungary and that the past 10 years had been troubled ones and
                            hardly productive of good relations. He said that this Government shared
                            the hope that relations might be improved and that existing problems
                            which stood in the way of such improvement might be resolved. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BW1">Barbour</persName> added that he hoped it
                            would not take the next 10 years to accomplish this.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the Minister’s request for US support of Hungary’s
                            application for membership in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BW1">Barbour</persName> pointed out that the
                            US has refrained from any use of the veto against membership applicants
                            and that Hungary, on each occasion, has simply failed to obtain the
                            required number of votes for admission. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BW1"
                                >Barbour</persName> said that the US has not been able to support
                            the admission of Hungary because to have done so in the light of
                            existing conditions would have been contrary to our principles and
                            conscience. He said that we would <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0112"
                            />be glad to have Hungary become a member of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> when conditions made it possible for us to approve
                            Hungarian membership in keeping with our principles and our
                            conscience.</p>
                        <p>The Minister thanked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BW1">Barbour</persName>
                            and again expressed the hope that relations would soon improve between
                            the US and Hungary. He made no reference during the conversation to any
                            specific problems in US-Hungarian relations.</p>

                                few who are self-deceived can now, after Geneva, see that the
                                present regime is here to stay; it is easy and advantageous to

                        <p>Thus the Warsaw regime is trying to demoralize anti-Communists at home
                            and abroad, not so much by what was actually done at Geneva but rather
                            by the Communist interpretation of that Conference—“the spirit of

                                October 3, 1955, pp. 523–529).</note> However, there may be a danger
                            that these statements will be discounted, not only by our friends but by
                            our enemies, if they are not followed up in actual negotiations at the
                            next Geneva meeting. It may then appear that, our original stand on the
                            satellites having been rebuffed by <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                                >Bulganin</persName>, we have abandoned all hope of really achieving
                            anything in their behalf in our desire to come to terms with the
                            USSR.</p>
                        <p>Presumably the Soviets will take the position that the satellites are
                            sovereign countries and that we should negotiate with them directly. But
                            I think that our main purpose will have been achieved if we show
                            clearly, at Geneva, that we feel that there can be no real relaxation
                            vis-à-vis the USSR without a satisfactory settlement of the satellite
                            question.</p>
                        <p>At all events I am afraid that the Communist propaganda machine has been
                            so active, clever and well coordinated since the Geneva Conference that
                            we must now take a stubborn stand on the satellites at the next Geneva
                            meeting or suffer a major psychological defeat in Eastern Europe.</p>

                                <p>It might also be pointed out that in practice, of course, there
                                    is a great overlap in the vulnerabilities listed in the Draft
                                    Progress Report, and most of the abovementioned activities of
                                    the Department would simultaneously cover several, if not most,
                                    of them. Even more important, all of the vulnerabilities listed
                                    have been exploited in many ways and on many occasions through
                                    the methods indicated above. These numerous actions simply do
                                    not lend themselves to concise and complete enumeration.
                                    Therefore, the examples cited below are included not as
                                    representing a complete list of total effort but rather as a
                                    very few typical instances of exploitation of Polish Communist

                                Nationalism and religion are probably the two most important factors

                        <p>There are several vulnerabilities, or sectors of activity, which are
                            omitted from the Draft Progress Report. Religion is briefly noted under
                            No. 37 but is actually one of the two greatest vulnerabilities. Some
                            others entirely omitted are: the Polish Government’s very great need for
                            foreign exchange, especially dollars, and its sources of that exchange
                            in this country; the Polish Government’s vulnerability abroad among
                            émigrés and hyphenated groups, where Warsaw is very active at present;
                            and the Polish regime’s extreme vulnerability and sensitivity regarding
                            anything which weakens or casts doubt on its claims to legitimacy, such
                            as our position that the elections of January 19, 1947 were
                            fraudulent.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion it might not be inappropriate to include at this time a
                            personal opinion regarding the total effect of our efforts against the
                            Warsaw Government. Admittedly that opinion is not necessarily correct or
                            completely informed on all aspects of our operations, but it is based on
                            a large and rather representative circle of personal contacts in this
                            country and abroad and on a huge mass of reading material from every
                            source of information available to me relating to current Polish
                            affairs.</p>
                        <p>Very approximately, and in very general terms, I would say that we are
                            usually just about able to hold our own with the Warsaw regime in
                            propaganda and operations, although at the moment the Communists have an
                            advantage through their clever exploitation of the “spirit of Geneva.”
                            On the other hand, if one judges from the results from the point of view
                            of what we <hi rend="italic">should</hi> be achieving with the
                            opportunities available to us, as compared to those available to the
                            Communists, then I feel that our record is quite poor. In other words,
                            although we are in a much stronger position than Warsaw the Communists
                            make up for this disadvantage by making far better use of the few
                            opportunities they do have. This is unavoidable to <hi rend="italic"
                                >some extent</hi> because of the handicaps with which any democracy
                            must contend in trying to combat and outmaneuver a dictatorship. But
                            there are other causes which can by no means be excused on these
                            grounds. Among these I would include Warsaw’s superiority in energy,
                            experience, money (probably) and, above all, in coordination of all
                            operations.</p>

                                to Demoralize the Emigration.</hi></p>
                        <p>In December 1954, the Department of State requested a detailed study be
                            undertaken of what appeared to be an intensive campaign intended to
                            demoralize the Soviet and satellite emigration. The campaign has taken
                            the form of spurious offers of amnesty, letters from home beseeching
                            relatives to return, special bulletins urging redefection and attacking
                            Western information organizations and exile associations and the
                            creation of new radio stations beamed to the émigrés. The Communist
                            efforts are not confined to propaganda but include such undercover
                            techniques as assassinations, kidnappings, and pressure by agents
                            provocateurs. The conclusions of the several interested agencies of the
                            Government are that the Soviets and satellites are attempting to sow
                            dissension among Eastern European émigrés, to disrupt anti-Communist
                            activities in which they participate, to induce those who are responsive
                            to propaganda or pressure to return to their native lands, and to lay
                            the groundwork for subversion among those who cannot be lured to return.
                            The campaign has as one of its goals to discredit the free world program
                            to care for and rehabilitate the refugees. Were it to achieve notable
                            success, the task of implementing <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            86/1 would become extremely difficult.</p>
                        <p>The Interdepartmental Escapee Committee developed a program of
                            countermeasures which was concurred in by the <gloss target="#t_OCB1"

                        <p>It was recommended that the program be launched by a statement from the
                            President reiterating the policy of asylum and of continued assistance
                            to the refugees. On several occasions the Department prepared and
                            submitted to the Special Assistant to the President draft material for
                            possible use in the Presidential statement. Unfortunately, the statement
                            was never made, thereby delaying implementation of other segments of the
                            plan. Presently, and without benefit of the high-level statement, the
                            Department is preparing to ask the governments of countries of asylum
                            and international agencies to augment their current refugee resettlement
                            programs.</p>

                            Kong to Formosa was commenced on May 16. This action which is evidence
                            of the responsibility of the Chinese Nationalist Government to those who
                            have served it faithfully will remove a serious negative psychological

                            enlistment of escapees in this program will not be minimized by too
                            stringent and unrealistic standards. During the period 30 June 1950–31
                            August 1955, 934 enlistments have been accepted. This is regarded within
                            Defense as an unrealistically low figure and the survey mentioned above
                            was accordingly instituted. It should be stressed however that the Alien
                            Enlistee Program must remain a highly selective one, and cannot be
                            considered in any sense a mass disposal mechanism. Latest figures give
                            934 enlistees as the total to date. Attention is invited to the fact
                            that personnel enlisted under this program are eligible to apply for
                            U.S. citizenship upon the completion of five years honorable service and
                            must therefore be carefully screened on a basis not exclusively related
                            to the objectives of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 86/1.</p>
                        <p>However, recognizing, among other things, the overall value of the
                            program to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 86/1 objectives, the
                            Department of Defense sponsored a two-year extension of this bill (June)
                            and on 18 July the Department of the Army sent a cable to field agencies
                            requesting a step-up in recruiting activities. There is presently
                            underway a Department of the Army study on ways and means whereby alien
                            enlistees can be more effectively utilized.</p>
                        <p>Interesting sidelights include the following: Army produced a film on the
                            alien enlistee which has been received favorably wherever shown. A check
                            of alien enlistees serving in Korea showed a considerable number in the
                            rank of sergeant. Two alien enlistees are warrant officers, one has
                            already been commissioned and one is presently being considered for a
                            direct commission as captain.</p>

                        <p>In support of the objectives outlined in <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 86/1, <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> issued to

                            guidance on current Soviet redefection efforts; and instructions to
                            posts in the resettlement areas of Brazil and Australia as to how to
                            handle interviews of successfully resettled escapees.</p>
                        <p>In addition, special guidances were prepared for the third anniversary of
                            the U.S. Escapee Program, as well as for special escapee arrival
                            ceremonies in the U.S.</p>

                            broadcasting continued to make good use of news items, feature articles
                            and commentaries and interviews covering escapee arrival, care,
                            training, transportation and resettlement. A decided increase in
                            interviews of resettled escapees in the U.S., Panama, Australia, Turkey,
                            Lebanon and Europe took place during the reporting period reflecting the

                        <p>In accordance with the appointment previously arranged at his request the
                            Polish Ambassador called at 4:30 to discuss the subject of Polish
                            repatriation.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador began by reading a statement to the effect that the Polish
                            Government has long desired the return of Poles living abroad and in
                            recent months has been making special efforts to achieve their
                            repatriation. He expressed the hope that the United States would take “a
                            positive attitude” towards Polish repatriation and said he would be
                            interested in any comments or views we might wish to express.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that he was not
                            sure of the purpose of the Polish Government’s repatriation program and
                            asked whether it was intended to augment Poland’s labor supply.
                            Spasowski replied that the question of labor supply was involved but
                            that, more important than that, his Government wanted Poles to
                            participate in all fields of Polish national life. “Poles belong in
                            Poland,” he added. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>
                            asked “Why?”. The Ambassador said that he thought it was only natural
                            that Poles should live in Poland. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                                >Murphy</persName> pointed out that thousands of Americans live in
                            Paris alone, and are found in large numbers in many other places
                            throughout the world, and that this Government does not feel constrained
                            to try to bring them back. The Ambassador made some vague references to
                            the dispersal of many Poles abroad as a result of the last war.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then repeated his request for “a positive attitude” on the
                            part of American authorities. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                                >Murphy</persName> replied that this Government traditionally has
                            held the view that people should be allowed to live where they wish and
                            that we feel any repatriation to Poland should be voluntary. The
                            Ambassador immediately agreed that his Government was also opposed to
                            involuntary repatriation but added that he hoped the local American
                            authorities would take a “positive attitude” toward voluntary
                            repatriation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> inquired
                            what the Ambassador meant by a “positive attitude” and exactly which
                            “local authorities” he had in mind. The Ambassador was not specific on
                            the first point but explained that our immigration <pb n="97"
                                xml:id="pg_97" facs="0127"/>officials would be an example of local
                            authorities in this case. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                                >Murphy</persName> said that it seemed to him that, in effect, Mr.
                            Spasowski was in favor of involuntary repatriation and wanted our
                            immigration authorities to suggest to Poles that they return home. He
                            added that we would do no such thing. The Ambassador denied that that
                            was his aim. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> then
                            asked whether the Ambassador had any specific complaints with respect to
                            American officials. The Ambassador said that he thought that prior to
                            his arrival in this country the immigration authorities might have
                            discouraged some persons from returning to Poland. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> asked him for specific examples
                            of such cases. When the Ambassador was not able to cite any examples Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> remarked that it was
                            pointless to make charges if they could not be substantiated unless the
                            only purpose of the Ambassador’s visit was propaganda, in which case it
                            was a waste of time for all concerned.</p>
                        <p>After a considerable pause the Ambassador said that he would at least

                        <p>On November 11, the Czechoslovak Government protested to the Embassy in

                            inciting leaflets into Czechoslovak airspace. The balloons, the
                            Czechoslovak Government maintained, were a danger because of their large
                            size and the explosive devices used to release the leaflets. The
                            Czechoslovak Government stated that on November 6 a balloon exploded
                            near the village of Mengusovce injuring eight persons, mostly children.

                            interest, greater skepticism and with public in rather dejected mood.
                            Hungarians by that time appeared to have lost hope that West would press
                            satellites issue and tendency, therefore, was to link their fate more
                            closely with German issue, apparently in belief that any Soviet retreat
                            re Germany would open new possibilities here. Over-all results meeting
                            were therefore disheartening, demonstrating as far as Hungarians
                            concerned that Iron Curtain still solidly in place and that neighboring
                            Yugoslavia and Austrian events, which gave them much natural
                            encouragement, took place in another world. One positive element from
                            satellite point of view appears to have been fact that sharp and
                            unfriendly atmosphere Foreign Ministers meetings contrasted favorably
                            with smiling, hand-clasping atmosphere of rapprochement which
                            characterized Summit meeting and which Hungarians viewed with
                            trepidation.</p>
                        <p>To just what extent results Foreign Ministers Conference contributed to
                            actual state of deep depression difficult to judge as series internal

                            large segment Hungarian public has until now refused to concede that

                            even heavier atmosphere of gloom, primarily because it is apparently
                            being interpreted by man in street to mean that regardless West’s
                            diplomatic efforts, status quo will prevail for more years than even
                            before believed possible).</p>
                        <p>Over-all result all this is that media today face much more skeptical
                            audience in Hungary and one, moreover, whose hopes for liberation from
                            Communist yoke have been badly shattered in recent months. Real danger
                            which faces us now appears to Legation to be that captive peoples will
                            steadily grow more and more resigned to fate <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101"

                            increasingly of opinion that it would be preferable to put more into
                            their work and into government-sponsored programs in hope that by so
                            doing they can better their own living standards and improve their
                            general lot. In fact [view] this possibility it seems vitally important
                            that we devise a new approach for our media which can supplant that
                            stimulus to resistance based on hope for liberation by one based on
                            current realities. Legation’s views this problem follow separately.<note

                            positive here. Not only would it demonstrate that West has no intention

                            Minister Chivu Stoica and Chisinevschi were present with Foreign
                            Minister Preoteasa joining us at end but Dej alone spoke. Conversation,
                            which covered Rumanian-US relations in general, was blunt and frank but
                            cordial and friendly throughout. Theme stressed by Dej was build-up
                            close personal, cultural and economic relations, which was official
                            Rumanian slogan with all Western diplomats during evening.</p>
                        <p>Dej voiced strong objections to parachuting self-confessed US agents into
                            Rumania. He characterized practice as infantile and noted they were
                            always caught and always would be. I said I had no knowledge such
                            operations and observed so-called confessions pretty much discredited
                            today. He also complained of treatment of Rumanian minister and staff in
                            Washington—travel restrictions, security surveillance, etc. I pointed
                            out similar absurd regulations governing diplomats here and suggested we
                            now begin destroy pyramid retaliatory measures which built up in past,
                            in order have foundation for sensible, mature relations. Dej agreed
                            heartily and claimed Rumanians had already started by giving visas to
                            Garst and Schutz. I emphasized this could not be considered plus on
                            Rumanian side ledger, since Rumanians were beneficiaries this visit. Dej
                            stated in presence Soviet Ambassador that Rumania would not always issue
                            visas to Americans just because they had obtained Soviet visas. I
                            replied that US would not always issue visas to Rumanians merely because
                            they had been privately invited by a US citizen.</p>
                        <p>Dej expressed impatience that US would not vote for Rumanian admission
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. I explained that American people
                            had long memories and much time needed to persuade them Rumanians were
                            serious in their present resolve to respect human rights. I stressed US
                            presently was going long way considering public opinion.</p>
                        <p>Dej showed intense interest in US trade. He stated more than once in
                            answer to my pointing out US not interested Rumanian products that this
                            hurdle easy to pass by other arrangements. At my suggestion he directed
                            Foreign Minister to prepare for me details of Rumanian needs from
                            US.</p>

                        <p>I told Dej I was returning for short visit to Washington to discuss
                            over-all Rumanian-US relations as I had found them and suggested that

                            Foreign Minister in order determine exactly where we stood on basis of

                            peoples, in Hungary at least, have gradually put more and more of their

                            on West to prevent Soviets from consolidating their position and
                            extending their hegemony and on outside intervention to break Russian

                                In attempting expand their hegemony over this area Soviets are
                                relying heavily on economic penetration. To gather adequate
                                where-with-all for this effort, Soviets require all of resources of
                                satellites. While the West can and will continue to exert all
                                possible pressure around the periphery, it cannot penetrate the
                                Russian purse. However, captive peoples can. If they fail to
                                produce, if they sabotage the new five-year plans, if they hold out
                                against their regimes and continue to refuse to cooperate in all
                                things, they can indirectly drain the Russian treasury. They can
                                thus not only prevent Soviets from further consolidating their power
                                in Eastern Europe but also exert negative influence on Soviet plans
                                for extending their hegemony. Part which captive peoples can thus

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robert Thayer</persName>, our Minister to Rumania, has had
                            an unusual number of contacts with top Rumanian officials, including the
                            Prime Minister [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] Gheorgiu-Dej, and has been
                            encouraged by them to believe that a détente in US-Rumanian relations is
                            possible. The Rumanians have expressed to the Minister their feeling
                            that increased trade between the two countries is possible and have
                            suggested the exchange of trade delegations. They have presented Mr.
                                <persName>Thayer</persName> with a list of products they would like
                            to obtain from the U.S., with particular emphasis on industrial and
                            agricultural machinery. The Rumanians apparently would like to obtain a
                            license from du Pont to manufacture nylon and dacron, saying this would
                            make them independent of the Soviet Union for textiles.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the Rumanians have attacked the broadcasts of <gloss
                                target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> and of Radio Free Europe as a
                            detrimental factor in relations with the U.S. Mr.
                                <persName>Thayer</persName> reports that there are no signs of
                            Rumanian leaders breaking away from the Russian type of Communism or
                            from Soviet control of their basic policies.</p>
                        <p>In response to inquiries to us from Mr. <persName>Thayer</persName>
                            regarding US policy toward Rumania, we have stressed the following.
                            Normal relations cannot be looked for until the Rumanian regime changes
                            its pattern of conduct. We doubt that a real increase of trade could be
                            arranged, and probably least of all on a government-to-government basis.
                            Rumania has little to offer the United States, and we question whether
                            the Rumanians are interested in the purchase of sizable amounts of
                            non-strategic goods. It is also questionable whether American industrial
                            firms would be willing to license their processes and extend credit. It
                            is true that the Rumanians are interested in US hybrid corn and might
                            also take some US lard products, with possibilities of payment in
                            Rumanian cement on a barter basis. We have no objections to normal
                            peaceful trade under the new Department of Commerce general licensing
                            policy, but we doubt that the US Government could or should be willing
                            to go further under present circumstances.</p>

                                    explained to the Secretary my reasons for believing that under
                                    existing circumstances the exchange of trade representatives
                                    with Rumania seemed to me to promise little value and to risk
                                    being distinctly misleading to some of our allies. The Secretary
                                    indicated his agreement with me and said that whereas this
                                    subject had been briefly discussed with Mr.
                                        <persName>Thayer</persName> when he saw him, he had not
                                    given Mr. <persName>Thayer</persName> any
                                encouragement.”</p></note></head>

                        <p>The Rumanian Government on their own initiative have been pressing me on
                            the subject of exchanging trade representatives to explore trade
                            possibilities between our two countries. The nature of this
                            representation, whether in the form of commerical attachés or trade
                            delegations, has been left for further discussion.</p>
                        <p>Although it is obvious that trade with Rumania cannot be of any real
                            commercial value to the United States, I believe this exchange should be
                            approved for the following reasons:</p>

                        <p>In the light of the series of conversations I have been having with
                            Rumanian officials, I believe that other advantages could be obtained on
                            the basis of reciprocity were I to return to Rumania with the approval
                            of the Department to explore this trade exchange further. <pb n="109"

                            the ledger.</p>

                            and the President for the President’s statement of December 30<note

                            Eastern Europe. They were also grateful to the Secretary for the firm
                            stand which he had taken on many occasions with respect to the
                            liberation of the <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0140"/>captive
                            nations. The <gloss target="#t_ACEN1">ACEN</gloss> were the spokesmen
                            for the oppressed peoples of Eastern Europe. They were not working for
                            the restoration of their own personal fortunes. Their task was to work
                            for the liberation of their countries which in some cases had been
                            deprived for as many as fifteen years of elementary human rights. Until
                            the liberation of the captive nations is achieved, international
                            tensions cannot be relaxed. The achievement of liberation is the
                            responsibility of all members of the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Masens then stated that, if it were agreeable to the Secretary, his
                            colleagues would present the views of the <gloss target="#t_ACEN1"
                                >ACEN</gloss> on various problems.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that the time available to him was limited and
                            that if all the members of the group expressed their views it might take
                            too long, Dr. Masens assured him that his colleagues would be brief.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Visoianu</persName> (Rumania) said that prospects for
                            liberation had stood at a low point after the Geneva conferences and the
                            admission of the four satellite governments to the United Nations.<note
                                n="4" xml:id="d44fn4">On December 14 the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                    >U.N.</gloss> General Assembly admitted 16 new members including
                                Albania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Rumania.</note> These developments,
                            particularly the latter, had been a powerful blow to the hopes of the
                            captive nations. They had created the impression that the Free World
                            accepted the Soviet position of domination. The <gloss target="#t_ACEN1"
                                >ACEN</gloss> was grateful for the President’s statement on the
                            peaceful liberation of the satellites. It was now clear that this was a
                            major goal of American policy. It was not only a wish but the active aim
                            of policy. Mr. <persName>Visoianu</persName> said that he wished to
                            propose three courses of action to advance the cause of liberation: (1)
                            to use all international institutions, such as the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and international conferences to promote
                            the cause of peaceful liberation; (2) to inform and arouse world public
                            opinion regarding the situation of the captive peoples with a view to
                            exerting pressure on the Soviet Government; and (3) to keep up the
                            morale of the captive peoples, which is an indispensable condition to
                            the achievement of this goal. Such peaceful procedures had been
                            envisaged in one of the resolutions recently adopted by the <gloss
                                target="#t_ACEN1">ACEN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the first point, Mr. <persName>Visoianu</persName> said
                            that there were excellent opportunities for the presentation of the
                            problem of the captive peoples at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.
                            The Soviets were vulnerable to attack on the subject of colonization and
                            denial of human rights. The initiative in this field should not be left
                            to the Soviets. The question of the liberation of the captive countries
                            should be placed on the agenda of <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111"
                                facs="0141"/>all international conferences. This point had been
                            raised and subsequently dropped at the Summit Conference, thereby
                            creating the impression that it had been introduced merely as a
                            bargaining point.</p>
                        <p>On the second point, Mr. <persName>Visoianu</persName> stated that
                            peaceful liberation required the support of international public
                            opinion. The question must therefore be placed before the world. The
                            Soviets will attempt to avoid discussion of this question, but the West
                            must insist. The US is not vulnerable to charges of imperialism, since
                            its record on this score is good. The record of the Soviet Union must be
                            publicly exposed. While the maneuverability of the US in this area may
                            be limited, the Soviet aims are a fact and must be made clear.</p>
                        <p>On the third point, Mr. <persName>Visoianu</persName> stated that the
                            spirit of independence in the captive countries is still intact. It is
                            hard to keep up one’s courage in the present situation, but ways must be
                            found to accomplish this. The captive peoples must be informed about the
                            policy of liberation. Mr. <persName>Visoianu</persName> stated that the
                            means at the disposal of the <gloss target="#t_ACEN1">ACEN</gloss> were
                            limited, but that they were anxious to collaborate in any effort to
                            reach the captive peoples.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">East-West Contacts and Trade</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. Sidzikauskas (Lithuania) noted that the question of East-West
                            contacts and trade had been on the agenda of the Foreign Ministers
                            Conference at Geneva, and suggested that it might also be discussed with
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> during his forthcoming
                            visit. The normalization of contacts between the Western world and the
                            Soviet orbit was not useful as long as the present political situation
                            prevailed. East-West contacts must be part of a general strategy looking
                            to the liberation of the captive countries. Such contacts are not a
                            subsitute for liberation. Under present conditions trade relations with
                            the orbit would involve the importation to the West of goods resulting
                            from the exploitation of the satellites and produced by slave labor.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Repatriation Campaign</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. Korbonski stated that the aims of the Soviet repatriation campaign
                            were clear. First, it sought to persuade people behind the Iron Curtain
                            that the émigrés had lost faith in the West, thereby weakening the
                            spirit of resistance. Second, it sought to disintegrate the strongest
                            anti-Communist émigré centers and to weaken the spirit of the émigrés.
                            Mr. Korbonski suggested that a “Marshall Plan” be devised on behalf of
                            the emigration. He referred to the deplorable situation of refugees in
                            camps in Austria and Germany and stated that they must be removed as
                            soon as possible. He hoped for a liberalization of US immigration laws.
                            Steps should be taken to provide jobs for those already in the West,
                            particularly for elderly intellectuals. The Communist <pb n="112"
                                xml:id="pg_112" facs="0142"/>repatriation campaign was aimed at the
                            upper levels of the emigration. These people will not be lured home by
                            propaganda but may eventually succumb if their personal material
                            situation is bad. Mr. Korbonski suggested, first, the establishment of
                            ethnic institutes to provide opportunities for émigrés to engage in
                            intellectual and spiritual work and second, the formation of an
                            employment agency to take care of older émigrés. He called for a bold
                            plan of aid which would provide the means necessary to liquidate the
                            present unhealthy conditions.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">National Communism</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. Dimitrov (Bulgaria) stated that, at the request of his colleagues, he
                            wished to raise the delicate question of national communism. The <gloss
                                target="#t_ACEN1">ACEN</gloss> did not deny the necessity of using
                            Tito to fight the Soviet Union. They wished to stress, however, that
                            national communism has no attraction for communists in the captive
                            countries. National communism is without ideological appeal. The
                            communists have built their strength on the basis of allegiances to the
                            Soviet fatherland. Without the Soviet Union the present regimes in the
                            satellites would not exist. National communism cannot succeed in the
                            captive countries. If it had any appeal, thousands of Bulgarians would
                            already have crossed the border into Yugoslavia.</p>
                        <p>New regimes in the satellites will not be communist. The <gloss
                                target="#t_ACEN1">ACEN</gloss> doubts that communist forces can be
                            used against the Soviet Union. Eastern European communists consider that
                            Tito has already returned to the Soviet fold. Soviet control in the
                            satellites is so efficient that no effective action can be taken except
                            by the democratic resistance forces in cooperation with the Free
                            World.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Secretary’s Remarks</hi></p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he was happy to have this meeting with the
                            representatives of the captive nations and he expressed appreciation of
                            the thanks they had conveyed for the President’s recent statement.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary recalled that for a long time before he became Secretary of
                            State he had advocated the peaceful liberation of the captive European
                            peoples. This was an essential goal and there could be no real peace
                            until it was realized. He had not changed his views in the meantime, and
                            he wished to make it clear that peaceful liberation was a definite aim
                            of US foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary mentioned that the President had dealt with the problem in
                            his opening speech at Geneva.<note n="5" xml:id="d44fn5">See <ref
                                    target="#d27fn5">footnote 5, Document 27</ref>.</note> The
                            President had later pointed out that he had privately discussed the
                            question with the Russians at Geneva. It had not been admitted to the
                            agenda since the <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0143"/>agenda had to
                            be established by common agreement. The President, nevertheless, had
                            talked about it in private meetings with the Russians, and the Secretary
                            himself had emphasized it from time to time. The President in his report
                            to the nation on August 25 [<hi rend="italic">24</hi>]<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d44fn6">See <ref target="#d26fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                    26</ref>.</note> had portrayed the satellite problem as basic to
                            the establishment of peace.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary mentioned that some people thought the President’s speech
                            may have been a factor in prompting the Russians to move into the Middle
                            East.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that our views apparently are not fully shared by all
                            members of the Atlantic community. There is some sentiment to the effect
                            that an acceptable world peace could be based on the status quo. This
                            was certainly not our view and it would merely mean that the Russians
                            would be able to consolidate their position to make further moves
                            against the free world. The Secretary said that the President and he
                            intended to adhere to our policy.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary related his impressions of the second Geneva Conference.
                            The Soviets seemed to be nervous about their position in the satellites.
                            At the first Geneva Conference they had agreed to German reunification
                            by free elections. At the second Conference they had repudiated their
                            agreement and had not even paid lip service to the principle of free
                            elections. Had they done so they might have spared themselves some
                            political and psychological losses. Soviet action had probably been
                            motivated by fear that free elections would be contagious in the
                            satellite area and would undermine their control. This explains why they
                            refused even to contemplate free elections.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary believed that the Soviets were faced with considerable
                            problems throughout the satellite area. Unrest in some of the countries
                            was greater than in others but the entire picture seems to cause them
                            anxiety. It was certainly to our advantage to see that anxiety
                            increase.</p>
                        <p>In the Secretary’s view the situation was not hopeless. What happens
                            behind the Iron Curtain sometimes happens unexpectedly. The basic
                            situation indicates that certain changes may be in the making. He, of
                            course, could not set a timetable or a date for what may likely
                            occur.</p>
                        <p>As regards contacts between East and West, which had been mentioned in
                            the discussion, the Secretary said we would wish to avoid those types of
                            contacts which would have a bad effect in the captive countries. We were
                            submitting East-West contacts to very careful scrutiny. As regards the
                            situation in refugee camps in Germany and Austria, which was another
                            topic mentioned, he was not familiar with it but he said other officers
                            in the Department would be available to discuss it.</p>
                        <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0144"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said he was sympathetic to changes in our immigration law
                            which would facilitate freer movement of refugees to the US. Changes in
                            the law were subject to Congressional decision, but the Executive branch
                            favored certain relaxations and we will keep in mind what the
                            representatives of the captive nations have said at this meeting.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he could understand the repugnance which had been
                            expressed with respect to certain aspects of “Titoism”. We must bear in
                            mind, however, that there are many angles from which the problem of
                            peaceful liberation may be approached and we should not ignore any one
                            of them. The Soviets try to detach colonial areas from the Western
                            countries in a two-phase operation, and the Secretary mentioned a
                            statement which he believed Stalin had made in 1924 elucidating their
                            aim in this regard. First, the Soviets try to break the ties with the
                            Western countries and then amalgamate the dependent areas in the Soviet
                            system. We ourselves should keep the way open for a kind of a two-phase
                            operation. Encouragement of nationalism would help loosen ties with the
                            Soviet Union. Thereafter, other problems might be more easily solved.
                            This, however, is not an exclusive approach.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that what concerns the representatives of the captive
                            nations is of deep concern to the President and himself. His listeners
                            would understand that certain details of the problem cannot be discussed
                            publicly. The Secretary was confident that if we all stand together for
                            the course we believe right, it will prevail. No peaceful step which
                            will advance the liberation of the captive nations will be overlooked.
                            We will continue to act to insure respect for the rights of man, freedom
                            and justice and independence for the small nations.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of the meeting the Secretary showed members of the

                            <item>The military, political, and economic significance of the
                                Satellites to the USSR is so great that Moscow almost certainly
                                regards the maintenance of control over the area as an essential
                                element of its power position. The Satellites provide the Soviet
                                Union with a defense in depth and an advanced position for launching
                                attacks on western and southern Europe. The Satellite regimes
                                themselves are valuable to the USSR as instruments in the conduct of
                                Soviet foreign policy, propaganda, and economic and subversive
                                operations. The Satellites represent an important element of
                                over-all Bloc economic strength. The total gross national product
                                    (<gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>) of the Satellites is
                                roughly two-fifths that of the USSR and includes significant
                                production of certain key materials and heavy manufactures. (Paras.

                            <item>The USSR now has, for all practical purposes, complete control
                                over the Satellite regimes and will almost certainly be able to
                                maintain it during the period of this estimate. Within the
                                limitations suggested below with respect to East Germany and
                                Albania, we believe that it <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0146"
                                />will remain firm Soviet policy to retain such control. This
                                control rests fundamentally on the USSR’s military capability of
                                maintaining its domination over the area. Control is exercised
                                primarily through the Satellite Communist parties, assisted and
                                guided by a complex of Soviet diplomatic and military
                                establishments, economic advisors, and police agencies. Moscow has
                                made clear that the status of the Satellites is not a matter for
                                international negotiation. In the case of Germany, the USSR has held
                                open the possibility of reunification on the basis of negotiations
                                between the East and West German regimes. We believe, however, that
                                the USSR will not voluntarily relinquish East Germany except in
                                exchange for a solution of the German problem favorable to Soviet
                                interests. It is also possible that the USSR might be willing to
                                reconsider its position with regard to Albania. For example, there
                                is a slight chance that the physical isolation of Albania from the
                                Soviet Bloc and its minor strategic value to the Bloc would induce
                                Moscow to use Albania as a pawn in Balkan intrigue. (Paras. 14, 17,

                            <item>The maintenance of effective Soviet control over the Satellites
                                does not preclude policy modifications calculated to take greater
                                account of local conditions, to promote smoother economic
                                development, and to diminish the impact of Soviet rule on Satellite
                                national sensibilities. In addition, Moscow might expect that such
                                measures would document the claim of Satellite independence, and
                                would thereby impress opinion in neutral and underdeveloped
                                countries and improve the propaganda position of Free World
                                Communist parties.</item>

                            <item>Despite Moscow’s firm control of the Satellites, there are a
                                number of local factors which hamper the execution of Soviet policy.
                                In some of the Satellites factionalism has become evident in the
                                party leadership and has caused confusion in the program. Some
                                elements privately resent dictation by Moscow and favor a reduction
                                of political terror and an increase in consumer goods. There are
                                many party members with a nationalist tinge who constitute a
                                potential for “deviation.” All the governments are still confronted
                                with problems arising from their unpopularity with the masses and
                                from the difficulties inherent in developing an efficient
                                administration in a totalitarian state under an alien ideology. We
                                believe, however, that none of these difficulties will jeopardize
                                either the control by Moscow-oriented Communists or the
                                implementation of Soviet policy.<note n="3" xml:id="d45fn3">The

                                    administrative problems in the Satellites, nevertheless, believe
                                    these problems are currently of no great magnitude and are
                                    likely to diminish during the period of this estimate. They
                                    would therefore omit this conclusion. [Footnote in the source

                                unlikely that an additional five years of Communist rule will
                                appreciably reduce this dissidence, or greatly diminish the
                                traditional national aspirations of the East European peoples. On
                                the other hand, dissidence is offset by a tendency of the Satellite
                                population to become resigned to Communist rule and by the gradual
                                increase in the number of Communist-indoctrinated youth. We believe
                                that, except possibly in East Germany, no development short of a
                                drastic impairment of Communist controls or the approach of friendly
                                forces in time of war would be sufficient to stimulate important
                                outbreaks of open resistance. (Paras. 31–35)</item>

                            <item>The Satellite regimes have as fundamental goals the expansion of
                                industry, the collectivization of agriculture, and the Sovietization
                                of the countries generally. In 1953, however, faced with mounting
                                difficulties, they reduced the pressure for rapid achievement of
                                these goals. Industrialization and collectivization of agriculture
                                were slowed and police controls became somewhat less obtrusive. In
                                early 1955, however, pressures for increasing output were revived,
                                the priority of heavy industrial development was re-affirmed, and
                                collectivization efforts were renewed. These modifications do not
                                appear to represent a full return to the pre-1953 program. (Paras.

                                the rate of slightly less than four percent per annum, a substantial

                                percent achieved in 1949–1954. Satellite agricultural output in 1960
                                will probably be about 11 percent greater than in 1954, while
                                nonagricultural production will increase by about 28 percent.
                                Meanwhile, total population is expected to increase about seven
                                percent by 1960. Manufactured consumer goods will account for the
                                major part of the small prospective rise in living standards.

                                than total Satellite trade. For economic as well as political
                                reasons, the Satellites apparently desire to increase their trade
                                with the Free World. In the absence of substantial medium- or
                                long-term credits from Free World countries, however, an early
                                expansion of Satellite exports will be necessary to balance any
                                increase in imports from the Free World. This confronts the
                                Satellites with the problem of adjusting the character and prices of

                        <p>On February 27, as part of a discussion of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 5602, “Basic National Security Policy,” at the 277th
                            meeting of the National Security Council, the Council examined the
                            policy of American economic assistance and development aid to
                            less-developed nations. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> stressed the need for administrative flexibility
                            to counter the Soviet Union’s current economic offensive. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HRR1">Rowland R. Hughes</persName>, Director of the
                            Bureau of the Budget, indicated that his organization was giving the
                            matter of administrative flexibility “most intense study.” The following
                            discussion then took place: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said
                                    that he was glad to hear this, but still believed that the
                                    problem required special mention in <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                        >NSC</gloss> 5602. With this view the President expressed
                                    agreement. Thereupon Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                        >Dulles</persName> said he would like just to outline a kind
                                    of example of what he had in mind. Suppose, for instance, the
                                    United States went to the Czechoslovakian Government and said in
                                    effect that Czechoslovakia needed a lot of cotton. We would be
                                    glad to give this cotton to Czechoslovakia, together with
                                    butter, meats, fats, and other foods of which we had large
                                    surpluses. We would then propose some kind of a deal by which in
                                    return for these commodities Czechoslovakia was to provide us
                                    with war goods or other things. Any such proposal as this to
                                    Czechoslovakia would simply ‘raise hell’ in the Soviet satellite
                                    countries. The Soviets, said Secretary <persName
                                        corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, are grievously
                                    exploiting the satellites. Why can’t we exploit this fact, just
                                    as the Soviets are exploiting our allies and the neutral
                                    nations? Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                                    pointed out that this, of course, was just an off-the-cuff
                                    suggestion and that it had not been staffed. But if the United
                                    States were to decide to make such <pb n="120" xml:id="pg_120"

                                    quickly if they were to be effective. Under the existing lack of
                                    flexibility we simply could not move quickly enough.</p>
                                <p>“The President inquired whether he could not put some such
                                    suggestion as that made by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                        >Dulles</persName> in the next message he was to send down
                                    to the Congress. Director <persName corresp="#p_HRR1"
                                        >Hughes</persName> added that it would be next to impossible
                                    to get the Congress to agree to any such proposal as that
                                    outlined by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                        >Dulles</persName>.</p>
                                <p>“The President said that of course the trouble was that the
                                    Congress believed that any and all U.S. trade with the Soviet
                                    bloc was wrong and bad. On the contrary, the President said,
                                    what he wanted to set in motion was centrifugal forces rather
                                    than centripetal forces in the Soviet bloc. U.S. trade with the
                                    bloc might eventually prove to be such a centrifugal force.</p>

                                    of the kind of flexibility that the President might need in the

                            the long-range objective stated in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            174. There is no evidence of progress toward this long-range objective
                            during the period under review. Nevertheless, this fact does not bring
                            into question the validity of the objective.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Current Objectives</hi>. The current objectives
                            cited first in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 174 are to disrupt
                            the Soviet-satellite relationship, to minimize satellite contributions
                            to Soviet power, and to deter aggression. Actions intended to disrupt
                            the Soviet-satellite relationship may have caused some difficulties for
                            Moscow, but no real evidence of a schism has yet made its appearance.
                            Our actions, however, may have played a part in persuading the Soviet
                            Union to moderate the extent to which its control and domination over
                            the satellites are openly demonstrated. In varying ways in the different
                            satellites, the USSR continues to show respect, within certain confines,
                            for the power of local nationalisms. Despite the continuing success of
                            Yugoslavia in maintaining its independent position which led to the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>-<persName

                            no repercussions of the Yugoslav example are as yet apparent in the
                            satellites. Although nationalist opposition continues to be a disruptive
                            force in varying degrees in the separate satellites, it must still be
                            concluded that a non-Soviet regime on the Tito model is unlikely to
                            emerge in any of the satellites under existing circumstances.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Satellite Contributions to Soviet Power</hi>. There
                            is some sign that U.S. policies and actions directed to minimize the
                            satellite contributions to Soviet power have shown a measure of success.
                            It is believed that the strategic controls on East-West trade have had
                            an effect in limiting the satellite contribution to the Soviet bloc
                            economy and war potential. These controls are regarded as a factor in
                            retarding technological advance in the industry of the satellite areas
                            to the extent that industry for the most part has been obliged to rely
                            on equipment and processes which are becoming antiquated. The new
                            communist domestic propaganda line stressing the need to learn
                            technological know-how from the West bears witness to the unsatisfactory
                            condition of satellite technology. U.S. psychological warfare programs
                            are believed to be contributing to the continued passive resistance of
                            the satellite populations which, through employee slowdown in industry
                            and reduced effort in agriculture, has the effect of holding down the
                            satellite contribution.</p>
                        <pb n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0153"/>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Soviet Control and Popular Hostility</hi>. A further
                            current objective in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 174 is to . . .
                            promote conditions favorable to the eventual liberation of the satellite
                            peoples. During the review period there have been signs in varying
                            degrees throughout the satellite area of a change in regime approach, a
                            greater flexibility of regime policy and ostensibly somewhat more open
                            criticism of conditions. Whatever the varying degree in the appearance
                            of liberalization in the satellite countries, there has been, however,
                            no relaxation of real controls anywhere in the area. The totalitarian
                            controls remain firm and effective, and none of the satellite regimes
                            appears threatened. On the other hand, the regimes have not been able to
                            overcome the separation between themselves and their peoples. In no
                            satellite country has the regime anything approaching majority
                            acceptance. As long as this alienation between people and regime is
                            sustained, one of the basic prerequisites to eventual liberation remains
                            at hand. While it is difficult to assess to what extent U.S. policy and
                            actions can affect such a basic popular attitude, even though we were to
                            attribute to them, at best, a minor role, we should not under-estimate
                            the importance of United States efforts. The Voice of America, Radio
                            Free Europe, the Crusade for Freedom and the other means of reaching the
                            satellite peoples seem to have served both to keep alive in these
                            peoples their sense of connection with the West and with Free World
                            ideals, and also to sustain their alienation from the Communist regimes.
                            At any rate, the continuing violent attacks of regime spokesmen and
                            propaganda against these U.S. operations are an indication of their
                            importance. Were they to be discontinued or diminished, the satellite
                            regimes would be relieved of a major concern and become more confident
                            in the eventual success of their efforts to subdue their own peoples and
                            refashion them in the desired communist pattern.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Strengthening of Elements Favorable to U.S</hi>.
                            Another <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 174 objective is to conserve
                            and strengthen the assets within the satellites, and among their
                            nationals outside, which may contribute to United States interests in
                            peace or war, and to the ultimate freedom of the satellites. Of major
                            importance in this connection have been the several statements by the
                            President and the Secretary of State affirming the U.S. intention not to
                            undertake any agreement which would have the effect of confirming the
                            status quo in the satellite area and expressing it to be the aim of U.S.
                            policy that the satellite peoples should eventually obtain their
                            independence and the right to determine freely their own form of
                            government. Their effect was greatly enhanced by the violent reaction of
                            the Soviet bloc authorities. While our efforts with respect to the
                            peoples within the satellite area have been limited in means, primarily
                            to such statements of policy and information operations, we are able to
                            give direct support to the activities of their nationals outside the
                            satellite area. During the review period we have <pb n="124"
                                xml:id="pg_124" facs="0154"/>conducted diverse programs to
                            strengthen exile political activities and to resettle Eastern Europe
                            refugees still living in camps or in temporary circumstances. A
                            promising organization of the Eastern European political exiles has been
                            developed during the review period, namely, the Assembly of Captive
                            European Nations.</p>

                            The West at the Geneva Conferences concentrated on the problem of German
                            reunification as the major European problem for which settlement was to
                            be sought. This had the effect of making the people in the Satellites
                            feel that their future was being subordinated. The satellite issue was
                            mentioned <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0155"/>in the form of U.S.
                            statements at the conferences and was raised informally with the Soviet
                            leaders, but it was not possible to include it as an agenda item. It
                            cannot be doubted that the inability of the West to press the satellite
                            issue at either Conference has had an adverse effect on the satellite
                            peoples. The admission of several satellites to <gloss target="#t_UN1"

                        <p>9. <hi rend="italic">U.S. Policy for Germany and the Satellites</hi>. The
                            intransigence of the Soviet policy at the Geneva Foreign Ministers
                            meetings is assuredly in part related to the Soviet position with
                            respect to the satellites. As long as the Soviets can keep the line of
                            division in Germany and hold the satellites in the shadow behind that
                            line, they will be gaining time for the consolidation of the Communist
                            regimes in the satellite area. The Soviet position in Germany must be
                            recognized as an advanced position with respect to Soviet control of the
                            satellite area. It is a moot question whether the Soviets have any real
                            expectation of communizing Germany or of maintaining their position in
                            Eastern Germany in the long run. At the least, they may hope to achieve
                            an eventual settlement which will afford some protection to their East
                            German supporters and perhaps provide some form or modicum of
                            neutralization. However, they may have an interest in postponing such an
                            agreement so that the satellite countries will be as far advanced
                            towards consolidation of the regimes and their popular acceptance as
                            possible. They may also be expected to seek in connection with any
                            settlement on Germany an international sanction of the status quo in
                            Eastern Europe. The European security pact proposed by the West at
                            Geneva, it may be noted in this regard, has been attacked by exile
                            political leaders as sanctioning the status quo in Eastern Europe, which
                            of course was not the case. Foregoing considerations (Paras. 8 and 9)
                            should be borne in mind in connection with the formulation of U.S.
                            strategy and policy with respect to Germany in order to ensure that
                            possible effects on the attainment of our policy objectives with respect
                            to Eastern European satellites continue to be considered in relation to
                            our German policy.</p>
                        <p>10. <hi rend="italic">The Time Factor</hi>. The outcome of the Geneva
                            Conferences confirms the estimate that a considerable span of time will
                            be required to attain the loosening of Soviet control in the satellite
                            area and the accomplishment of U.S. objectives, either long-range or
                            current. The sheer passage of time involves certain difficulties with
                            respect to the implementation of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            174. It is likely to become more and more difficult to keep hope of
                            liberation alive in the satellite peoples. The strength and
                            determination of the political refugees are apt to decline; the older
                            generation of political exiles will die off, and the young refugees are
                            likely to become so absorbed by their new environments that they will
                            cease to take an active interest in the affairs of their <pb n="126"
                                xml:id="pg_126" facs="0156"/>home countries. Moreover, the passage
                            of time in itself tends to confirm the status quo. Continued diplomatic
                            recognition, possible limited government agreements (on property
                            questions), admission of all the satellites to United Nations
                            membership, increased trade, cultural exchanges, visits of Congressmen,
                            American tourist travel will all tend to signify normalization of
                            relations and an implied acquiescence in the Communist puppet regimes.
                            It must be regarded as a major problem in the implementation of <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 174 that any movement toward a
                            relaxation of tensions between East and West is bound to be widely
                            interpreted in the satellites as a weakening of Western determination to
                            achieve their liberation from Soviet control and a disposition to accept
                            their status as permanent.</p>

                            the status of the satellites, remain limited. Moreover, implementation

                            considerably by the shifting climate of the international situation. In
                            the absence of a cold war climate, many of the courses of action would
                            be difficult to pursue. For example, those intended to encourage
                            anti-communist activities and passive resistance are somewhat
                            incompatible with a détente. Likewise, efforts to bring about a basis
                            for a negotiated settlement and to encourage evolutionary changes in
                            satellite regimes, as proposed for existing policy (particularly under
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5505/1), are not always
                            compatible with programs intended to keep alive the hopes and
                            aspirations of the captive peoples. A re-examination of <gloss

                            practice of such incompatible policies. It may be that the U.S. will
                            have to undertake to follow simultaneously two policies with
                            inconsistent courses of action, representing divergent approaches to the
                            one objective.</p>
                        <p>12. <hi rend="italic">East-West Contacts</hi>. Efforts at the Geneva
                            Conference of Foreign Ministers to obtain agreement with the Soviets on
                            a broad range of increased contacts involving a freer exchange of ideas,
                            information, and news as well as freer travel and cultural exchange met
                            with no success. Nevertheless, the Soviets continue to evince interest
                            in a restricted increase in contacts and cultural exchange. There is
                            some indication that a corresponding relaxation, albeit of lesser
                            dimension, is likewise desired by the satellite regimes. While the
                            United States desires to increase contacts on a selective basis and in a
                            wide variety of fields with the peoples of the Soviet bloc, the
                            objective of the Soviet and satellite regimes appears to be to permit
                            only a restricted number <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0157"/>of
                            carefully controlled contacts, especially between official delegations,
                            to exploit Western freedoms in order to obtain scientific and
                            technological information, and to give the appearance of raising the
                            iron curtain without actually doing so. Although there appears little
                            likelihood of any striking success in opening breaches in the iron
                            curtain soon, plans contemplate our continuing to press suitable
                            opportunities in this field, making available to the world press
                            continued examples of satellite fearfulness to permit their peoples
                            contact with the West.</p>
                        <p>13. <hi rend="italic">Trade with the Bloc</hi>. As tensions have appeared
                            to diminish, groups in the West have increased their demands for freer
                            trade with the bloc. Although restrictions have been removed on certain
                            commodities, pressures may continue to reduce much further the range of
                            goods now considered strategic. In recent months several satellites have
                            indicated their interest in resuming more active trade relations with
                            the U.S. In Czechoslovakia we have undertaken to discuss this question
                            in a comprehensive negotiation on outstanding economic issues, e.g.,
                            U.S. claims for nationalized property and other Czech financial
                            obligations. In Hungary we offered to discuss the question of trade in
                            the context of a broad examination of mutual problem areas. Negotiation
                            of trade matters with these countries presents difficulties, not only
                            because of our refusal to discuss controls on strategic trade but also
                            because of our lack of flexibility with respect to hindrances to
                            non-strategic trade, such as the denial of tariff concessions to Soviet

                            During the past year, and particularly in connection with the tripartite
                            preparation for the Geneva Summit meeting, it became apparent that the
                            British and French Governments did not share our strong convictions on
                            the satellite question. They were anxious that the satellite issue not
                            be raised or pressed at the Summit meeting, fearing that it might become
                            an obstacle to progress in negotiations on other subjects. While there
                            is no clear evidence that they would be as yet prepared to make any
                            agreement which would have the effect of sanctioning the Communist
                            regimes in the satellites, nevertheless they are not inclined to make
                            positive statements, such as we have, indicating a firm position on the
                            satellites. The U.S. is considering at this time approaching both the
                            British and French Governments in order to seek acceptance on their
                            parts of a position with respect to the satellites that is closer to the

                        <p>The Executive Secretary briefed the National Security Council on the
                            contents of the two subject progress reports (copy of briefing note
                            filed in the minutes of the meeting).<note n="5" xml:id="d50fn5">Not
                                found.</note> Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> was obliged to leave the meeting, and his place
                            was taken by Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                                >Hoover</persName>. At the end of his briefing, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName> suggested that Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> might wish to add to his
                            remarks.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> said that U.S.
                            policy toward the Soviet satellites presented a difficult subject to
                            come to grips with from a practical point of view. In trying to achieve
                            the objectives of this U.S. policy, the Operations Coordinating Board
                            had encountered extreme difficulty in devising effective courses of
                            action. We had achieved very little in terms of concrete gains.
                            Circumstances limited us to “playing for the breaks” and doing our best
                            to maintain the morale of the populations of the satellite states. In
                            any event, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>
                            believed that it <pb n="129" xml:id="pg_129" facs="0159"/>was desirable
                            for both these policies to be reviewed by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> Planning Board, with particular reference to the events
                            of the last few days.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he had no quarrel with the verdict of those who
                            had prepared the progress reports, but added that constant searching
                            might conceivably reveal possible courses of action to achieve our
                            objectives. We mustn’t be less aggressive in pursuing our objectives
                            simply because we had thus far not achieved the progress we would like
                            to see.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> said that he was
                            glad to hear the President speak these words. While, he said, there was
                            no forward progress recorded in these progress reports, the fact that
                            the Soviets have not succeeded in getting further than they have in
                            their satellite states constituted a gain in some sense. Thus the hope
                            of liberation had not yet been blotted out in the satellite populations.
                            The President replied that history proved that no single country like
                            Soviet Russia could really be successful in controlling indefinitely
                            vast areas such as those comprised by the satellites unless, like
                            ourselves, in an earlier era with the Indians, we virtually exterminated
                            the population. The President added that it was essential that we keep
                            the hope of liberation alive in the satellites as a force on our side.
                            So we should keep up the good work and hope that the Soviet Union keeps
                            encountering additional trouble in the satellites. In a certain sense
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had been right
                            in his public statements that the Soviet Union had been obliged to
                            change its tactics owing to the lack of success of their previous
                            tactics.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> offered the
                            opinion that there was one course of action at least in this area that
                            the United States might pursue more actively. He referred to his
                            February visit to Berlin,<note n="6" xml:id="d50fn6">Under Secretary
                                    <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> visited Berlin on
                                February 5 to be the principal speaker at the ceremonies marking the
                                tenth anniversary of the radio station RIAS (Radio in the American
                                Sector) and to dedicate a local high school named in honor of his
                                father, former President <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Herbert
                                    Hoover</persName>. While in West Germany, February 2–4,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> met with
                                officials of the Federal Republic of Germany.</note> and said that
                            90% of the East Germans would vote now for union with a free Germany.
                            Accordingly, the United States should publicize what the Soviets have
                            been guilty of doing in East Germany. It was a very weak spot in their
                            armor.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed the opinion that we should make West Berlin a
                            “showcase of prosperity”, especially in terms of sending food, of which
                            we have such a tremendous over-abundance. Let’s send them pork, beef,
                            wheat, and rice—millions of dollars worth of it.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> informed the
                            President that he had investigated this matter when he had been in
                            Berlin. He had found the West Berliners very well fed and clothed.
                            Moreover, they were proud that <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0160"
                            />their situation had been achieved by their own efforts and exertions.
                            West Berlin was the most completely anti-Communist place in the
                            world.</p>

                                    corresp="#p_JJE1">Jacobs</persName> reported on a continuing
                                exchange of views between him and the British Ambassador in Warsaw
                                as to the nature of Polish communism and the Polish Government. The
                                British Ambassador, Sir Andrew Noble, held that a definite Polish
                                policy was emerging in Warsaw, and the Western powers, particularly
                                the United States and United Kingdom, should take advantage of the
                                post-Geneva Conference relaxation of East-West tensions to support
                                and encourage Warsaw’s independent policy, thus weakening Soviet
                                domination of Poland. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JJE1"
                                    >Jacobs</persName> believed that encouraging the present Polish
                                Government would mean bolstering the prestige of a regime which the
                                United States publicly condemned. <persName corresp="#p_JJE1"
                                    >Jacobs</persName> held that the relaxation of Soviet control in
                                Poland was only superficial; Poles still had no real freedom of
                                action in foreign affairs. Such friendly overtures as suggested by
                                Ambassador Noble in the fields of cultural, economic, political,
                                information, and sports affairs, were, from <persName

                            by the following comments.</p>
                        <p>It is the Department’s present belief that until or unless some basic and
                            drastic change occurs, either in the nature of Soviet policies or in the
                            power relationship between the Free World and the Soviet Bloc, Poland
                            will continue to be ruled by men whose decisions are based primarily on
                            their understanding and interpretation of the desires and intentions of
                            the Kremlin. The Department views such manifestations of “relaxation” as
                            the reorganization of the Polish security police, the recent “thaw” in
                            Polish literature, and the <hi rend="italic">Nowe Drogi</hi>
                            <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0162"/>reference to a Polish road to
                            Socialism as significant and noteworthy changes in Communist tactics in
                            Poland, but not as evidence of the emergence of an independent “Polish
                            policy”, as that term is usually understood. Possibly these recent
                            developments cannot be explained solely as window dressing attributable
                            to: 1) Moscow’s desire for relaxation of international tension following
                            Stalin’s death and in view of growing Western unity against Communist
                            aggression; 2) the reconciliation with Tito and the Belgrade communiqué
                            of last June; and 3) the President’s and the Secretary’s clear
                            statements at Geneva that the satellites would be watched as a barometer
                            of Soviet intentions. Nevertheless the Department has seen no proof of
                            any fundamental relaxation in the real bases of Soviet power in Poland,
                            namely Soviet Party, police and military controls, plus the overwhelming
                            and encircling strength of the USSR.</p>
                        <p>Thus, even making allowances for the many reservations and qualifications
                            with which the British Ambassador has supported his analysis of present
                            Soviet-Polish relations, the Department cannot agree with his basic
                            thesis that a definite Polish policy independent of Moscow is now
                            emerging.</p>
                        <p>As indicated above, there are good reasons for both Moscow and Warsaw to
                            encourage the Free World in various ways to hope and believe that Polish
                            foreign and domestic policies are not controlled by Moscow and that the
                            Polish Communists are pursuing a Polish policy of gradual but basic
                            liberalization. Ambassador Winiewiez, for one, has long represented the
                            Polish Government in exactly this light with great tact and personal
                            charm. Occasionally these tactics bear fruit even with intelligent
                            observers, as apparently occurred in the case of Hugh Delargy’s judgment
                            and interpretation of the activities and motives of Boleslaw Piasecki
                            (reference despatch 173 of November 22, 1955).<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d51fn5">In despatch 173, the Embassy referred to the view of
                                British Labor M.P. Hugh Delargy, who had visited Poland in November
                                1955 to examine church–state relations, that Boleslaw Piasecki, a
                                so-called Catholic collaborator with the Polish Government, was a
                                courageous and formidable patriot. (Department of State, Central
                                Files, 032/11–2255)</note> The British Ambassador’s opinions and
                            recommendations, on the other hand, may have arisen not so much from a
                            real misunderstanding of the situation in Poland as from a hope of
                            finding something a little more satisfying than simple unqualified and
                            “unconstructive” opposition to the Soviet and Polish Communist
                            authorities.</p>
                        <p>However, the Department is by no means in agreement with the argument
                            that there is no alternative between accepting present Polish policy as
                            independent or semi-independent and, on the other hand, abandoning all
                            attempts at flexibility and maneuver and simply dismissing the Poles “as
                            permanent vassals of the Kremlin and therefore not worth much attention”
                            (reference paragraph 7 of the enclosure to <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133"
                                facs="0163"/>despatch 238 of January 10, 1956). The Department feels
                            with Sir Andrew that the overwhelming majority of Poles are still
                            anti-Communist and deserving and potentially very useful allies of the
                            Free World (although continued Communist rule may change this situation
                            more rapidly than the Ambassador now foresees). Moreover, not only is
                            Poland the Soviet Union’s most important East European satellite,
                            politically and strategically, but it is also clear that American policy
                            towards the Warsaw regime is closely linked to our relations with the
                            USSR and can affect and influence these relations in many ways. For
                            exactly this reason it is essential that the shadow of the recent “thaw”
                            in Poland not be accepted as the substance of a genuine Soviet
                            withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>The Department has stated repeatedly that it is not reconciled to the
                            continued enslavement of Poland and other Eastern European countries by
                            the USSR and strenuous efforts are being made, and will be continued, to
                            encourage as well as to inform the Polish people despite the artificial
                            barriers imposed by Moscow. Developments in Poland will be followed and
                            studied as closely and objectively as possible and consolidation and
                            extension of Communist power and prestige in that country will be
                            opposed within the limits, and by the methods, prescribed by Soviet-Free
                            World relations. Policy will be flexible but realistically based on the
                            main course of Communist performance and on the essentials of Communist
                            power rather than on its more superficial aspects or on the hope of
                            luring the present Polish Communist leaders away from Moscow by
                            concessions or “friendship”. The Department will be guided by the
                            conviction that a firm and realistic policy vis-à-vis Soviet rule in the
                            satellites will eventually yield more results than attempts at
                            appeasement or cooperation with Polish Communists.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the Department believes that the situation in Poland is by
                            no means frozen and that it would be a mistake to adopt frozen attitudes
                            which failed to take cognizance of potential fluidity and any incipient
                            signs and trends of development favorable to the United States. It is a
                            firm postulate of United States foreign policy, confirmed at the highest
                            level of this Government, to seek to promote evolutionary changes in the
                            policies and conduct of the Soviet and satellite regimes which will be
                            in United States interest. In so doing, it will of course be desirable
                            to influence these regimes toward the choice of those alternative lines
                            of action which, while in their national interests, do not conflict with
                            those of the United States. With respect to Poland this means among
                            other things that we should be ready to encourage and foster any bona
                            fide tendencies toward independence and national freedom from Moscow
                            which may reveal themselves in Party and official circles. As indicated
                            above, we do not intend to accept, or make concessions to, a sham
                            independence nor do we intend to make <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134"
                                facs="0164"/>concessions in the hope that the Warsaw regime might
                            some day seek independence from Moscow. But were there any bona fide
                            signs of a favorable development, we should of course shape our actions
                            in cognizance thereof.</p>
                        <p>Also we believe that it would even be appropriate to take suitable
                            actions in hope of stimulating an independent Polish policy, insofar as
                            such actions did not represent concessions on our part nor serve to
                            enhance the prestige of the existing regime. We believe that the
                            personal relations of our diplomatic representatives with Polish
                            officials may have a certain flexibility as a consequence of this
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>Thus, although the Department does not believe that the USSR is
                            relinquishing any basic controls in Poland, or is planning to do so in
                            the future, it is apparent that developments in Poland and Polish public
                            opinion are factors to be taken into consideration in determining
                            American policy and that the continuation of Soviet rule in Poland need
                            not deprive American policy and Embassy activity of all significance or
                            flexibility.</p>
                        <p>Some comments on various aspects of Polish-American relations touched
                            upon in recent Embassy communications are set forth below. It is hardly
                            necessary to point out that most of these cannot be regarded as hard and
                            fast rules applicable under all circumstances and must in the last
                            analysis depend to a very great degree upon the Embassy’s judgment of
                            any given situation.</p>

                        <p>The Department is opposed to “softening” the content or tone of <gloss

                            the Polish Government might reduce or abandon jamming. Presumably the
                            Polish authorities would not sanction so extreme a measure unless <gloss
                                target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> programs were drastically altered and
                            such a change would be exceedingly difficult to explain or justify to
                            Polish listeners. At the same time the Polish Government would no longer
                            bear the onus of jamming and there would be a strong implication that
                            similar changes were justified in all <gloss target="#t_VOA1"

                            broadcasts do not indulge in simple vituperation and haranguing and they
                            do give recognition to postwar achievements in Poland, although these
                            are rightly attributed to the efforts and sacrifices of the Polish
                            people rather than to those of the Communist authorities. The present
                                <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> policy is to inform and
                            encourage the Polish people, in vigorous, expressive and explicit

                            fruitless resistance. Any fundamental and <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135"

                            would be extremely unwise to appear sensitive to Communist complaints
                            and maneuvers against <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>, which

                                <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> and other Free World programs
                            appear to have little significance and are probably even desirable in
                            that they afford the listener some selection to suit his preference.
                            However, it would unquestionably be helpful for Moscow’s propaganda
                            purposes if (as appears now in no way likely) <gloss target="#t_BBC1"
                                >BBC</gloss> Polish broadcasts were sweetened to an extent which

                        <p>There is no reason to believe that the tremendous disparity between
                            information available to this Government in Poland and to the Polish

                            within the near future. Nevertheless the Department would prefer to
                            maintain reciprocity in exchanges of information through formal
                            channels, and the Embassy should therefore continue to refer official
                            requests for Government publications or information of any importance to
                            Washington, even though the Embassy will usually be the channel of
                            ultimate distribution in Poland.</p>
                        <p>Naturally this rule need not, and should not, be applied to all official
                            inquiries. Possibly it would have been both useful and appropriate for
                            the Embassy to provide or promise the Polish Press Agency representative
                            mentioned in Embassy despatch 57 of August 30, 1955<note n="6"

                            economic and cultural achievements. Decisions in such cases must depend
                            on the Embassy’s judgment of the particular situation. In general, Iron
                            Curtain countries should not be provided with technical information or
                            other useful data without securing some substantial quid pro quo. On the
                            other hand, it would seem desirable to furnish whatever unclassified
                            material is available in the Embassy including Government publications,
                            reflecting political or economic and social progress in America. If no
                            objection is perceived it is suggested that the Embassy resume sending
                            American publications directly to Polish addresses (reference despatch
                            76).</p>

                        <p>As regards private, informal requests for unclassified information, the
                            Department feels that they should not only be fulfilled by the Embassy
                            whenever feasible but that every appropriate opportunity should be
                            utilized for the casual distribution of suitable reading material. The
                            Department was pleased to note the Embassy’s work in this field as
                            reported in despatches 186 of December 5, 1955<note n="9"
                                xml:id="d51fn9">In despatch 186, the Embassy reported it was

                            distribution can gradually be expanded.</p>
                        <p>As the Embassy is aware the Polish Embassy in Washington conducts many
                            informational and propaganda activities, including the preparation and
                            distribution of press releases, the distribution of magazines, pamphlets
                            and books, and the promotion of exhibits depicting Polish cultural
                            achievements. So far as can be ascertained this propaganda work has
                            enjoyed relatively little success in America and rather than attempting
                            to curtail it it is hoped that it may serve as a justification, or if
                            need be a bargaining point, for increasing similar Embassy activity in
                            Poland.</p>
                        <p>To achieve this purpose it is believed that it would be preferable not to
                            make a formal request of the Polish authorities to reopen a <gloss
                                target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> office or library in Warsaw, at least
                            at this time, but rather to increase the Embassy’s informal activities
                            in this line under circumstances in which the Poles would find it
                            awkward or embarrassing to protest. Perhaps it would therefore be
                            desirable to cease referring Polish inquirers to the Polish Embassy in
                            Washington because of the closure of Embassy informational activities in
                            1951.</p>
                        <p>For the Embassy’s information there is now being assembled an exhibit of
                            some 100–150 carefully selected photographs taken in America during the
                            last ten years. Within the near future the Polish authorities will be
                            asked to indicate where and when the exhibit can be shown in Warsaw,
                            Krakow and other cities. In the event permission <pb n="137"
                                xml:id="pg_137" facs="0167"/>is refused the Department will consider
                            the advisability of requesting, with suitable publicity, the Polish
                            Embassy to withdraw its exhibits from this country.</p>
                        <p>A representative of the Museum of Modern Art has recently been discussing
                            with Soviet officials the possibility of sending an American art exhibit
                            to Moscow this year (reference Embassy telegram 353 of December 11,

                            knowledge no decision has been reached. It is quite possible that if the
                            Polish Government agrees such an exhibit would be sent to Warsaw

                            future inquiries of this nature so that it may also, if it wishes, get
                            in touch with the American firm concerned. The Department is now
                            discussing the general subject of American pictures behind the Curtain
                            with the Motion Pictures Association.</p>
                        <p>It is hoped that additional films will be forthcoming from the Department
                            of Agriculture and <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> (reference
                            despatch 283 of February 7, 1956). It may be desirable to prepare Polish
                            sound tracks for two or three of the most appropriate and request the
                            Polish authorities to give them wide popular distribution rather than
                            restricting them to official and technical circles.</p>
                        <p>It had been hoped that more success would be achieved this year than last
                            in connection with an exhibit for the Poznan Fair. However, as the
                            Embassy has already been informed, it has not proved possible to
                            complete arrangements for American participation.</p>

                            Groups:</hi></p>
                        <p>The Department hopes that any future exchanges of persons and groups will
                            have some relevance and advantage from our point of view and not lend
                            themselves to interpretation by Communist propaganda as indicative of
                            relaxation of tension and further recognition of the Polish Government
                            and the status quo. For this reason the Department would prefer to avoid
                            exchanges on the official level and to concentrate on private
                            individuals and small groups in the fields of culture, education,
                            sports, etc. Obviously it will not be desirable to leave the initiative
                            in suggesting and selecting exchanges to the Polish Government, and the
                            possibilities of exploiting defections or Polish refusals to accept
                            invitations should be taken into account.</p>

                        <p>The Porgy and Bess visit to Poland appears to have served a useful
                            purpose and the Halina Czerny-Stefanska tour in America boomeranged
                            against Warsaw to some extent because of the protests and adverse
                            publicity which arose when Communist propaganda linked her performances
                            with the Mickiewicz celebrations.</p>
                        <p>The Department feels that any good effects of air force or military
                            visits of the type suggested by the British Ambassador would be more
                            than offset by Polish Communist propaganda exploitation designed to
                            increase the prestige of the Warsaw regime.</p>
                        <p>Nor does the Department favor extending invitations to top ranking Polish
                            agricultural representatives to duplicate the visit of their Soviet
                            counterparts.</p>
                        <p>The Department has no reliable information on what plans, if any, are

                        <p>In a recent development the Bulgarian Government has indicated through
                            its Legation in Paris that it is now prepared to propose formally that
                            diplomatic relations be resumed. This development, representing a
                            departure from Bulgaria’s previous insistence that the US make the first
                            move, appears to reflect an eagerness on the part of the Bulgarian
                            Government to normalize relations with various countries including the

                            resumption of relations with Bulgaria would constitute a dangerous
                            precedent for Latin American countries not now having diplomatic
                            relations with the Soviet bloc, and <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>
                            expressed similar apprehensions with respect to countries in its area.
                                <gloss target="#t_P1">P</gloss> observed that such a development
                            might weaken resistance groups in Bulgaria and that it might place us in
                            an embarrassing position should the Bulgarian Government at some later
                            date renege on assurances of proper conduct given in order to bring
                            about a resumption of relations.</p>
                        <p>The apprehensions reflected in these views were discussed at a meeting in
                            my office in which representatives from the areas concerned
                                participated.<note n="4" xml:id="d52fn4">No other record of this
                                meeting has been found in Department of State files.</note> It was
                            noted that the US currently maintains relations with four Soviet
                            satellites in Eastern Europe, and would merely be completing the pattern
                            of its representation in that area by resuming relations with Bulgaria.
                            Any illusion that a return to Sofia would constitute acceptance of the
                            Soviet-dominated Bulgarian regime could be dispelled by our information
                            media, and could be explained in Latin American countries and elsewhere
                            through our diplomatic missions. It might be noted that Argentina has
                            for several years maintained diplomatic relations with Bulgaria and
                            other Soviet satellites in Eastern Europe. As for the possibility of a
                            lack of good faith in negotiations it is to be hoped that the Bulgarians
                            particularly have learned that there is a limit to our patience. It was
                            therefore concluded that although certain risks must be recognized, the
                            advantages to be gained by the US through a resumption of relations with
                            Bulgaria, on the favorable terms which now appear available to us,
                            outweigh the disadvantages.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that Congressional leaders should be consulted before any
                            formal negotiations looking toward a resumption of relations are
                            undertaken.</p>
                        <p>It was further agreed that the governments of the Balkan Pact countries
                            (Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey) should be informed of our intended
                            action. These governments, as well as the governments of France, Great
                            Britain and Italy, have already been told informally of the Bulgarian
                            approach in Paris. Reactions were generally favorable to a resumption of
                            US-Bulgarian diplomatic relations. The Yugoslav Acting Foreign Minister,
                            Mr. Prica, told our Ambassador in Belgrade that in his view the approach
                            marked a favorable development in which he was certain his government
                            would be much interested; he added that <pb n="141" xml:id="pg_141"
                                facs="0171"/>the approach appeared to be another step in satellite
                            policy to normalize relations with the West, and that he was inclined to
                            think tolerable conditions could now be arranged in Sofia.</p>

                            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Background:</hi></p>
                            <p>Diplomatic relations with Bulgaria were suspended on February 20,
                                1950 after the Bulgarian Government had refused to withdraw a note
                                which accused the American Minister in Sofia of subversive activity
                                and declared him persona non grata. The rupture had been preceded,
                                however, by a series of indignities and restrictions, including 1)
                                false charges against American mission personnel, 2) intimidation
                                and persecution of local employees, 3) delays in the issuance of
                                visas for American replacement personnel, and 4) increasingly severe
                                travel and housing restrictions. As a consequence of these measures
                                the effectiveness of the American Legation in Sofia had already been
                                severely curtailed when the note demanding the Minister’s recall was
                                received. The note itself, therefore, which purported to be based on
                                testimony produced at the “show trial” in December 1949 of Traicho
                                    <pb n="142" xml:id="pg_142" facs="0172"/>Kostov, a former
                                Bulgarian Communist leader and alleged “Titoist”, served only to
                                bring to a climax a deterioration in relations which had begun more
                                than two years earlier.</p>
                            <p>It was believed at the time that the suspension of relations might
                                demonstrate to Soviet leaders that there was a limit to our patience
                                and might result, at least temporarily, in some improvement in the
                                treatment accorded our missions in other Soviet bloc countries.
                                During the months following, however, the Communists unfolded a
                                series of “show trials” intended to lower the prestige of the US in
                                the area, and they imposed increasingly severe restrictions on the
                                activity of our missions in satellite capitals. For its part, the
                                Bulgarian Government reacted to the suspension with further attacks
                                on the American mission, disclaimed all responsibility for the
                                suspension, and alleged that the American withdrawal served merely
                                to support the charges advanced during the Kostov, and subsequently
                                the Shipkov trials. Although this belligerence later abated,
                                Bulgarian officials have persisted in the view that the lack of
                                relations which resulted from the suspension was not their fault.
                                This view has been expressed as recently as December 31, 1955, in an
                                address by the Bulgarian Prime Minister and Party leader, Vulko
                                Chervenkov.</p>
                            <p>A shift in the Bulgarian attitude toward the rupture appeared in
                                1953, after the death of Stalin, when Bulgarian officials let it be
                                known through French diplomatic circles in Sofia that their country
                                would welcome a resumption of relations with the US. These
                                sentiments were subsequently confirmed in two public addresses by
                                Chervenkov. In view of these “feelers” the question was examined in
                                the Department and the determination made that, on balance, US
                                interests would best be served by resuming relations and
                                re-establishing a mission in Sofia. It was subsequently decided,
                                however, after Congressional leaders consulted by the Department had
                                expressed firmly adverse reactions, that any movement in the
                                direction of renewed diplomatic relations at that time was
                                premature. Accordingly, no action was taken, and the matter was left
                                dormant during 1954 and most of 1955. It was only revived after
                                Bulgaria’s entry into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, when a
                                Bulgarian diplomatic representative in Paris called on the Deputy
                                Chief of Mission at the American Embassy, indicated informally that
                                he wished to raise the question of resuming relations, and
                                acknowledged that he was doing so on the specific instructions of
                                his government. This representative subsequently declared that his
                                Government intended to transmit a note to the Embassy which would
                                formally propose that diplomatic relations between the US and
                                Bulgaria be resumed.</p>

                            <p>As this chronology indicates, the Bulgarian Government’s public
                                attitude toward diplomatic relations has altered considerably during
                                the past five years. The vituperative attacks of 1950 have given way
                                gradually to a milder approach which, in its most recent
                                manifestation in Paris, reveals a willingness now on the part of
                                Bulgaria actually to take the initiative in seeking to resume
                                relations with the US. This change may also be reflected in current
                                Bulgarian efforts to achieve a normalization of relations with
                                Greece and other countries with which such relations were previously
                                strained or non-existent.</p>
                            <p>The considerations which in 1953 had influenced the Department’s
                                position concerning the desirability of resuming relations with
                                Bulgaria, and which with some modifications still prevail, include
                                the following: 1) intelligence acquisition, 2) desirability of
                                having American representatives on the spot should any development
                                of major significance take place in Bulgaria, 3) protection of US
                                citizens and US property in Bulgaria, 4) possible furtherance of
                                nationalistic aspirations, and 5) demonstration of continuing
                                American interest in the welfare of the Bulgarian people. Bulgarian
                                membership in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and the
                                presence in this country of a Bulgarian <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                    >UN</gloss> delegation provides, moreover, a new element which
                                can be regarded as an anomaly in the absence of diplomatic
                                relations.</p>
                            <p>No one of these considerations alone is enough to justify a
                                resumption of relations. . . .</p>
                            <p>Lack of US representation in Sofia has the further adverse effect of
                                reducing our capacity to exploit promptly and effectively any
                                development of major significance comparable, for example, to the
                                Yugoslav defection of 1948, and prevents the US from having a source
                                of guidance useful in political formulation and propaganda
                                evaluation. By its absence, moreover, the US is precluded from
                                following with optimum vigilance Bulgaria’s reaction to the recent
                                Yugoslav-Soviet rapprochement, a development of particular
                                importance to this area in view of Bulgaria’s traditional ties with
                                Yugoslavia. It will be recalled that Tito’s expulsion from the
                                Cominform was in part predicated on his continued support for a
                                South Slav Federation which had earlier been advocated by the late
                                Bulgarian Communist leader, Dimitrov, and the Kostov trial which led
                                directly to the suspension of US-Bulgarian diplomatic relations had
                                also featured the alleged heresy of the South Slav Federation,
                                denounced by the Kremlin in 1948. An improvement in
                                Yugoslav-Bulgarian relations might bring about a revival of the idea
                                of the Federation and should therefore have the closest attention of
                                the US.</p>
                            <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0174"/>
                            <p>As for other US interests, it is noted that not more than 40
                                Americans, all believed to be dual nationals, now reside in
                                Bulgaria, and our experience in other satellites shows that the
                                assistance which might be offered them even if there were an
                                American mission in Sofia would be very limited. The US Government
                                nevertheless has an obligation to do all in its power to protect and
                                assist these unfortunate people; the absence of a diplomatic
                                mission, and the consequent lack of consular services (even though
                                these are in part furnished by the US protecting power, Switzerland)
                                handicaps US efforts on behalf of its nationals.</p>
                            <p>With respect, finally, to the question of demonstrating US interest
                                in the welfare of the Bulgarian people and promoting nationalistic
                                aspirations through the re-establishment of diplomatic relations,
                                some differences of opinion are inevitable. It appears, however,
                                that, on balance, and provided it were accomplished on terms
                                favorable to the US, a re-establishment of relations would be useful
                                in the furtherance of US objectives with regard to the sympathies of
                                the Bulgarian people. It could also provide a means for giving
                                encouragement to nationalistic (Titoist) tendencies which might
                                develop among Bulgarian leaders. There is, of course, some danger
                                that other nations—and some elements of the Bulgarian people—might
                                interpret a re-establishment of relations as a mark of US approval
                                of the regime. It should be clear, however, from our words and deeds
                                with respect to other Communist countries of Eastern Europe with
                                which we now maintain diplomatic relations, that the US does not
                                approve the Kremlin-dominated regimes now in power. In the case of
                                Bulgaria, moreover, we are not establishing relations but merely
                                resuming them after receiving assurances that the situation which
                                led to the suspension in 1950 has been corrected.</p>
                            <p>The question may arise that a resumption of relations with Communist
                                Bulgaria would be inconsistent with US policy against the
                                establishment of relations by countries of South America and Africa
                                with the USSR. It does not appear, however, that any such
                                inconsistency exists. The USSR is the prime mover in the Communist
                                field which seeks to extend its influence wherever possible;
                                Bulgaria is but one of the lesser appendages of the Soviet
                                apparatus. In the re-establishment of diplomatic contact with
                                Bulgaria, moreover, the US is simply completing a part in the
                                over-all pattern of its Eastern European relationships.</p>
                            <p>It is of course evident from the eagerness with which the Bulgarian
                                Government apparently seeks to resume relations that it, too, would
                                expect to gain, presumably in prestige and general acceptability in
                                the family of nations. This gain, however, would not appear to be as
                                significant as that which would result for the US. The Bulgarian
                                initiative in seeking a resumption of relations as expressed in
                                Paris suggests that Bulgaria might be willing now to pay a price to
                                achieve its goal. <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0175"/>The
                                recent Greek experience also suggests an approach which could be
                                utilized with profit by the US. The Greeks agreed first to resuming
                                relations with limited representation headed by a chargé d’affaires,
                                with the understanding that full representation would depend upon
                                the settlement of certain outstanding issues including Greek
                                compensation claims against Bulgaria. Although these issues have not
                                yet been settled, the Bulgarian Government has recently shown such
                                eagerness to achieve full normalization that it may yet meet Greek
                                demands. Meanwhile, Greece has obtained many of the advantages of
                                diplomatic relations without appreciable loss of prestige or
                                bargaining position. This experience is reflected in the
                                recommendations below.</p>

                                        renewed contact with the Bulgarian Government unless it can
                                        first be assured that the Bulgarian Government is now

                                        withdrawal of Bulgarian charges against the American
                                        Minister which resulted in the suspension of relations, b)

                                        which led to the suspension, c) a statement of the desire of

                                        intercourse, and e) the omission of any reference to
                                        previous charges that the US was responsible for the
                                        suspension of relations in 1950. These points may be made
                                        either in a public statement to be issued by the Bulgarian
                                        Government or one of its leaders, or in a note to be

                                Tehran, April 3, and asked for the Legation’s comments. In his
                                telegram, Chapin wrote: “I suggest that by extension, case could now

                        <p>In Legation’s view situation obtaining here at moment is riper for
                            exploitation than it ever has been. Rakosi is clearly having his
                            difficulties. Whatever his standing in Moscow, he is facing mounting
                            antagonism from his old right wing opponents and growing opposition from
                            some of his late followers here and, with his personal prestige probably
                            at an all-time low, resulting situation is highly volatile. Moreover,
                            Rakosi’s Stalinist background, his unsavory record and his current
                            political acrobatics make him an extremely vulnerable target. A
                            carefully prepared diplomatic offensive with coordinated propaganda
                            exploitation could not only provide his opponents with valuable
                            ammunition but possibly even render his position untenable in eyes of
                            Moscow. Even failing latter objective, it would appear inadmissible for
                            US fail take total advantage opportunities now open for exacerbating
                            internal dissension and promoting already existing dissaffection towards
                            Rakosi.</p>

                        <p>On international level, Legation also believes that Hungary today offers
                            US and west their most vulnerable target for purposes demonstrating to
                            world at large wide contradiction between what Communists are professing
                            and what practicing, and also real under-the-surface leaning of recent
                            tactical shifts. Case histories of what being carried out here with left
                            hand while right is distributing “peaceful coexistence” leaflets are so
                            striking as to present a most convincing picture if properly
                            exploited.</p>
                        <p>Above considerations prompted recommendations contained Legation
                            telegrams 374 and 375.<note n="5" xml:id="d53fn5">In telegrams 374 and
                                375, April 3 and 4, the Legation suggested using recent harassment
                                and arrest of Legation personnel by Hungarian secret police as the
                                basis of a protest to the Hungarian Government that these actions
                                were not in keeping with supposedly improving Hungarian-American
                                relations. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 120.162164/4–356 and
                                123–Tiedtke, Fred, respectively)</note> If moves suggested therein
                            were closely followed by presentation notes incorporating ideas
                            suggested by Chapin and whole offensive properly orchestrated, Legation
                            believes that great deal could be accomplished both on internal and
                            international levels. Legation strongly of opinion that, in any event,
                            Rakosi should not be permitted write end to Rajk affair at point he has
                            chosen and we hope, therefore, that Department will see its way clear to
                            move forward promptly in effort wring advantage from opportunities which
                            recent events have opened to US.</p>
                        <p>To be most effective, Chapin suggestions would appear require rather
                            careful research project to provide background for selection most
                            telling quotations, which due absence files here covering this period,
                            can probably be best done by Department.</p>

                                the West and whose departure has been insisted upon by the Tito
                                regime. U.S. efforts have resulted in some relaxation of pressure by
                                the Yugoslav Government, and permission for limited, essential
                                screening there. Italy has received 250 of these refugees for onward

                                likely to have a dampening effect upon the morale of escapees and
                                upon their activities. Although U.S. programs will take this
                                intangible factor into consideration, additional high-level
                                statements may be required in the U.S. and other free world
                                countries to meet future developments.</item>

                                    the Legation proposed sending the Hungarian Government a note
                                    charging it with “police-state methods” not in keeping with its
                                    stated policy of “peaceful co-existence” and “socialist
                                    legality.” This move would be part of a campaign to sow
                                    dissension among Hungarian Communists and to demonstrate to the
                                    rest of the world that Hungary was still Stalinist. (<hi

                        </list>
                        <p>This despatch is being written as a follow-up to the Legation’s despatch
                            406, since I believe that recent political and economic developments in
                            Hungary and recent events affecting the Legation’s relations with this
                            Government need to be considered within a single frame of reference in
                            planning our next moves. We have attempted, as doubtless the Department
                            has, to keep all recent developments and our reactions thereto tied
                            together in our minds; but I feel it might be beneficial now to do so on
                            paper as well.</p>
                        <p>Our general view of the Hungarian scene prior to the Soviet Twentieth
                            Congress has been made clear, I think, and we have had no indication
                            that the Department’s view has been different. We have seen the past
                            year as a period during which Rakosi endeavored to put his political
                            house in order after the rapid erosion of political controls under Nagy.
                            He cracked down in the countryside (grain collection and
                            collectivization), in the private sector (sharp curtailment of the
                            burgeoning private trade), in industry (better labor discipline), in the
                            Party and in the arts. His primary, though by no means sole, concern was
                            probably political rather than economic. We have felt that he used this
                            period to restore political controls before undertaking a serious
                            attempt to improve Hungary’s industrial efficiency and agricultural
                            output. And in our opinion he has been reasonably successful in this
                            political sphere; more successful than we thought a year ago would be
                            the case.</p>
                        <p>These efforts in the political field had their effect in the economic
                            field also, and the year saw improvements in some areas, though not in
                            others. In agriculture the regime was aided by better weather than <pb
                                n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0184"/>in recent years; in industry at
                            least a partial halt was called to the deterioration in respect to costs
                            and waste which had been going on under Nagy.</p>
                        <p>But although conditions have improved, they have by no means improved
                            enough. Because the situation in both agriculture and industry is still
                            very bad, the running sore of foreign trade debts has continued and
                            apparently is becoming even worse. The new five-year plan will not only
                            call for increased output, but will also require some reallocation of
                            resources as a result of greater coordination with other countries in
                            the bloc. This may add a further strain. Furthermore, there has also
                            been the factor, we believe, that Rakosi, since the Nagy period, has
                            been under somewhat greater pressure than before to show results. These
                            efforts will call for greater sacrifices from the people, and so be
                            unpopular by their very nature; the precondition for their undertaking,
                            therefore, is firm political control.</p>
                        <p>With sounder political bases under him, it would have been logical (and
                            in fact we thought signs thereof were beginning to develop) for Rakosi
                            to have launched a serious effort in the economic field during this
                            year. Such an effort is also increasingly necessary. But what has
                            happened? At precisely the moment when one might have anticipated that
                            this would get under way, the repercussions of Stalin’s denigration
                            (particularly, of course, the rehabilitation of Rajk<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d55fn3">See <ref target="#d53fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                    53</ref>.</note>) swept into Hungary and, initially at least,
                            struck Rakosi a heavy blow and again upset his political balance.</p>
                        <p>We cannot yet be sure whether he can survive this, or whether it was
                            intended that he should. On the surface, at least, it would appear that
                            he is still in Moscow’s good graces. As a matter of fact one can make a
                            very good argument that Rakosi should be Moscow’s choice for the job,
                            since Moscow has seen once, with <persName>Imre Nagy</persName>, what
                            can happen in a satellite with a weaker hand at the helm. If there were
                            to be storms here (and everyone must have anticipated them after the
                            November writers’ revolt<note n="4" xml:id="d55fn4">Reference is to
                                demands by Hungarian writers for cessation of bureaucratic
                                restraints on artistic freedom and creativity which took its most
                                dramatic form in a writers’ memorandum to the party leadership,
                                written in mid-October 1955 and released in November. The Hungarian
                                party leadership successfully counterattacked with a resolution of
                                the Central Committee condemning the writers. The Legation’s
                                reporting on these events is in telegram 243 from Budapest, December
                                16. (Department of State, Central Files, 764.00/12–1655)</note>),

                        <p>And at first Rakosi seemed to show confidence. The tone of his report on
                            the Twentieth Congress, unless the Legation and other Western observers
                            in Budapest badly misread it, certainly seemed to indicate that,
                            whatever was to happen to Stalin’s memory, Rakosi’s own position was not
                            to be questioned. The personal cult had existed, <pb n="155"
                                xml:id="pg_155" facs="0185"/>it was admitted, lower down in the
                            Party, but no suggestion was given that it included, of all people,
                            Matyas Rakosi. The Party later went further and affirmed that the “fight
                            against the internal enemy” would go on in Hungary, if not in Russia,
                            implying strongly that Rakosi would continue for some time still to hold
                            down the political hatches.</p>
                        <p>We do not know, of course, whether this was the initial intent in Moscow,
                            whether the magnitude of the effect here in Hungary was properly
                            estimated from the beginning, or whether the reaction to the Stalin and
                            Rajk revelations was greater than had been intended. In any event, there
                            have been sharp reactions which have been quite openly admitted, and in
                            the nature of things it would seem almost certain that there will be
                            more. There have also been some indications, including the current
                            high-level Hungarian delegation in Belgrade, that Hungary is finally
                            going to pay the $120 million (or a large part of it) to Yugoslavia,
                            which unless it is underwritten by the Soviets will add a further strain
                            to the country’s finances. If the Hungarians do pay, this could perhaps
                            be construed as the price for leaving Rakosi in his seat.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the dominoes in Eastern Europe have begun to fall.
                            Whatever course may have been intended for Hungary, it is certainly true
                            that the situation here has deteriorated very rapidly, doubtless much
                            faster and further than originally intended. The very sudden decision to
                            postpone the transfer of Soviet Ambassador Andropov is probably an
                            indication of Soviet concern. We are consequently now inclined to
                            believe that there are good chances for Rakosi’s eventual removal—just
                            how good, we of course cannot say definitely. But whatever the Soviets
                            may intend to do with Rakosi, or whatever they finally decide they must
                            do with him, they have certainly made his political position precarious
                            and they may have added to his financial problems. His position is
                            sufficiently precarious, we believe, to offer a possibility for United
                            States action to have some effect on future developments.</p>
                        <p>With the above background, we have been trying to examine the problem of
                            coordinated United States action. Before going further, however, I think
                            we should have our objectives clearly in mind, or rather what we may
                            realistically hope to achieve thanks to the Rajk revelations and the
                            apparent blessing given to collective leadership. I would submit that,
                            unless the Soviets have more up their sleeve than they have thus far
                            disclosed, we can hardly hope to realize more this time than a repeat,
                            on perhaps a slightly larger scale, of what happened without pressure
                            from us during the Nagy era, when a more “moderate” element was brought
                            into power. To realize this would again set the stage for weakening
                            Party control over its stalwarts, and theirs over the masses, in turn
                            bringing a general weakening of the regime’s political and economic
                            controls. It is, of course, by no means certain that this will be
                            achieved (although the weakening process <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156"
                                facs="0186"/>may have already begun), but I believe that this is a
                            realistic short-term goal which can be reasonably hoped for and striven
                            for. Even this should not be sneered at. Whether such an accomplishment
                            would then move Hungary into a position where she could later be
                            “nudged” still another step is a moot question. But chances appear at
                            least as good as in 1954 and perhaps better, considering the disgrace of
                            Stalin, the position of Tito and the times in general.</p>
                        <p>The problem of Rakosi’s personal position is closely connected with these
                            general objectives and hopes. For the immediate future, at least, we
                            believe this to be paramount. His removal or retirement, even with high
                            honors, in the near future would be interpreted by the anti-Rakosi
                            faction as a victory for it, by Tito as a victory for him, and by the
                            general population as a victory for passive resistance. It would be
                            interpreted by everyone as a defeat for the policy in effect in Hungary
                            during the past year, which was then fully approved and supported by
                            Moscow. Therefore, as a single target, the removal of Rakosi is our most
                            important short-term aim, however directly or indirectly we try to
                            achieve it. The Rajk statement provides us with a unique opportunity to
                            attempt to exert pressure.</p>
                        <p>There are other objectives, however, which can also be served by an
                            attack based on the Rajk revelations, and which make such an attack seem
                            worthwhile even if its prime purpose of unseating Rakosi be not
                            attained. These are the following:</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>To bolster anti-Rakosi strength within the regime itself. This
                                strength has always existed and is now growing. A strong approach

                                Rakosi’s opponents. We are convinced that many, perhaps even a
                                majority of Party members, are not fully aware of what the “state
                                within a state” has been up to or of its activities under Rakosi’s
                                direction. Exposing this would, we believe, heap new fuel on the
                                already smoldering fire.</item>

                                here for the worst excesses of the period, is to brand the campaign
                                as primarily propaganda. It may be that there is ample evidence of
                                this in the U.S.S.R. itself; but if not, or if it cannot be used, a

                        <p>To summarize, I believe that the present situation in Hungary is such
                            that appropriate United States action could influence future
                            developments. The Legation has already transmitted its initial views on
                            the proper handling of this situation. We have also strongly recommended
                            (Legdes 399<note n="5" xml:id="d55fn5">Despatch 399, April 13, dealt
                                with Hungary’s international credit position as an opportunity for
                                leverage. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 864.10/4–1356).</note> and
                            previous) the examination of possibilities for curtailment of Western
                            credits, and action of this type would be particularly appropriate in
                            the near future. Now a third possibility would be an official request to
                            Hungary for an apology to the United States Government and to certain of
                            its representatives for the treatment they received from elements in
                            this Government which are now discredited.</p>
                        <p>I believe that such a request, if properly handled and if given full
                            publicity, would demonstrate to the world and the Soviet Union the
                            anomaly of permitting Hungary to follow the Soviet lead only half way;
                            of calling Rajk innocent but not lifting the charges against the United
                            States. It would point to the continuation today of practices current in
                            1950, which the regime is now condemning; and would indicate to everyone
                            who knows Hungary that as long as Rakosi sits on his throne there will
                            be doubts as to Soviet sincerity. All this, we hope, would present the
                            Soviets with a choice between ousting Rakosi or tacitly acknowledging
                            that the anti-Stalinist campaign is a fraud. We would be gambling on
                            their being more interested in global than in internal satellite
                            reactions, and furthermore, on their being willing to run the risks
                            inherent in ditching Rakosi.</p>
                        <p>It is of course true that any real effort to call black black in Hungary
                            may involve the United States in some risks. If we fail to achieve our
                            end we may draw down the wrath of Rakosi even more on our heads. In our
                            view this is a risk to be recognized and taken. Anti-American propaganda
                            can hardly sink to depths much lower than those already plumbed, and in
                            any event such tactics probably hurt the regime as much as, if not more
                            than, they hurt us. We are most susceptible in relations between the
                            Legation and the Government; but some risk can hardly be avoided here
                            without a complete compromise of principle.</p>
                        <p>In order to bring maximum pressure to bear on the Soviet Union, and at
                            the same time to have maximum influence in Hungary, it would seem
                            reasonable to take successive actions over a period of time, with the
                            first move coming as quickly as possible.</p>
                        <p>Initially we had thought of the first note on the Sergeants’ case<note

                                Budapest to inform the Hungarian Foreign Office orally that

                            recommend that the essence of the latter be made use of. The most
                            important element of that note is that it points to the continuing
                            activity of the same state within a state which was responsible for the
                            Rajk “provocation” and which has now been discredited. It also should be
                            evident that Rakosi himself was just as involved as the secret police in
                            1950 and continues to be today.</p>
                        <p>The Legation has not tried to draft a note on the Rajk case, since the
                            Department has more complete information available on details of the
                            case and on its relation to the Mindszenty and other cases; and also
                            because it will require legal talent to demonstrate these
                            interrelationships. The Legation’s general ideas, however, would be

                                    against it by the Hungarian Government and that it would welcome
                                    any development in Hungary which would give a promise of better
                                    relations in the future. It had, in fact, believed some months
                                    ago that there might be a chance for such an improvement, but
                                    had been forced to cancel plans for any serious discussions with
                                    the Hungarian Government because of the activities of precisely

                                <item>We should then call upon the Hungarian Government to carry the
                                    process begun at Eger to its logical conclusion, and to clear
                                    the record of the infamous charges which have long sullied not
                                    only U.S.-Hungarian relations but also the reputation of the
                                    Hungarian Government throughout the world. We should refer to

                                        >Lodge</persName> presented his arguments for the Volunteer
                                    Freedom Corps. He made six points: (1) The Volunteer Freedom
                                    Corps would be a step toward carrying out U.S. obligations to
                                    the satellite nations; (2) it would combat the Soviet
                                    re-defection campaign; (3) it would alleviate fears of West
                                    German rearmament by stationing a <gloss target="#t_VFC1"
                                        >VFC</gloss> battalion in Germany; (4) it would provide
                                    “nuisance value” and could be a bargaining chip in future
                                    negotiations; (5) it would serve as proof to the rest of the
                                    Free World that the West is committed to the fight for “freedom
                                    and individual dignity”; and (6) it would provide a cadre of
                                    trained officers able to “assimilate the mass of anti-communist
                                    Slavs” in the event of general war. (<hi rend="italic"

                        <p>As you will recall, the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> decision left
                            the timing of the initiation of action to my discretion, in consultation
                            with the Secretary of Defense. At that time, of course, the principal
                            inhibiting factor was the Four Power Conference which was about to begin
                            in Geneva. The picture has changed somewhat in view of the outcome of
                            this conference and in view also of the categorical refusal of the
                            Soviet Government to discuss any change in the status of the Eastern
                            European satellites. At the same time, there are certain other
                            considerations which have convinced me that the present time is not
                            appropriate for implementation of this project. The most important of
                            these considerations are as follows: <list>

                                <item>It seems clear that the Soviet bloc is currently trying to
                                    de-emphasize the military aspects of its aggressive program and
                                    is placing reliance on a large-scale political, economic and
                                    psychological offensive aimed at neutralizing and dividing our
                                    allies and spreading Communist influence in the uncommitted
                                    areas. From the point of view of free world opinion, I think it
                                    would be a mistake for us to be in the position of seeming to
                                    respond to these new tactics by an action which would be
                                    regarded as having an essentially military character. While I
                                    fully appreciate the fact that the principal value of the
                                    Volunteer Freedom Corps would be psychological rather than
                                    military, it is by no means certain that this fact would be
                                    understood and accepted in other parts of the free world.</item>

                                <item>I know that you will also agree on the importance of our being
                                    in the strongest possible position in the disarmament
                                    discussions which have now been resumed. We are all conscious of
                                    the necessity that world opinion be convinced of the merits of
                                    our position on this subject, and that we avoid implying any
                                    lack of confidence in the possibility of success. Although the
                                    formation of the Volunteer Freedom Corps would be aimed at the
                                    Soviet bloc only in a psychological sense, there is danger that
                                    it would be misunderstood by Free World opinion and exploited by
                                    the Soviets as being inconsistent with the objectives of the
                                    disarmament negotiations.</item>

                                    raise major political difficulties for the Chancellor and
                                    expressed the hope that we would not approach him again on the

                        <p>405. After dinner at Polish Embassy last night, Lajos Acs, second ranking
                            Secretary Hungarian Communist Party, played 20th Congress record for my
                            edification. Claimed ad nauseam, Commies have really changed, wish
                            improve relations with US and settle outstanding issues. I countered
                            with willingness explore any problem but made explicitly clear that
                            progress toward better relations impossible until Hungarian secret
                            police brought under control.</p>
                        <p>Gave him in presence Karpathy, Deputy Foreign Minister, and Szigeti,
                            Anglo-American Desk Officer, substance our complaints, and when he
                            suggested I acquaint Sik with facts, I told him that Foreign Office was
                            fully aware of situation but had told me it powerless because secret
                            police constitute state within state. Acs contrived appear astonished
                            when heard of continuing police harassment after Hungarian adoption 20th
                            Congress line and emphatically asserted he would order police to
                            stop.</p>
                        <p>Conversation, which lasted some two hours, was tense only when I spoke of
                            state within state. Ended with Acs again requesting me talk with Sik,
                            which I intend do informally middle next week assuming no
                                objection.<note n="2" xml:id="d57fn2">In telegram 408 from Budapest,

                            and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> expressed the view
                            that the United States should take particular pains to see what it could
                            do to exploit developments in Poland in our national interest. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> added that he hoped to
                            present to the Council next week the text of the now famous statement
                            made by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> before the
                            Twentieth Party Congress in Moscow. The text that we have is the one
                            allegedly transmitted by Moscow to the governments of the Soviet
                            satellites. It was a very interesting document, although it was not
                            clear whether the present version had been expurgated or not. At any
                            rate, it purports to contain just what <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> had had to say at the Moscow meeting.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he
                            understood that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had
                            spoken extemporaneously on this occasion. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> replied that he spoke both
                            from a prepared text and extemporaneously. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then indicated his view that
                            whatever text we got would have been “doctored” before being sent out of
                            Moscow.</p>

                        <p>In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName>’s last
                            point, the President inquired whether it was the influence of family and
                            friends at home which had induced Soviet defectors to return to the
                            USSR. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>
                            <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0194"/>replied that this was so, and
                            that the defectors got many letters from their families urging them to
                            return. The defectors sometimes suspect these letters to be faked.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> stated that in
                            the last few days the Government of Communist China had issued a decree
                            requiring all citizens of Communist China to register with the
                            Government if they had any relatives living in the United States.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> predicted that
                            this move would be the basis for an elaborate redefection campaign to
                            induce Chinese in the United States to go back to China. As far as he
                            was personally concerned, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> said, he could perceive no objection to these
                            Chinese returning, provided they were not coerced into doing so. Why do
                            we care whether or not they go back if they go back freely? In point of
                            fact, this was our actual policy on this issue.</p>
                        <p>The President said he agreed with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName>’ view, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
                                Dulles</persName> pointed out that in any case we had no legal means
                            of restraining Chinese in the United States from returning to Communist
                            China if they so desired. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> repeated his question as to what reason there was
                            for the United States to try to keep any of these Chinese from going
                            back. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> also
                            added that it could make no possible difference to us. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>, however, pointed out the
                            serious morale effect if large numbers of defectors voluntarily went
                            back to slavery in their Communist homelands. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> added parenthetically that he
                            was by no means sure that the five redefecting “Tuapse” sailors had not
                            decided on their own to return to the USSR.<note n="4" xml:id="d58fn4"
                                >See <ref target="#d35fn12">footnote 12, Document 35</ref>.</note>
                            It was significant that if they had wished to avoid returning, there
                            were at least three places between New York and Moscow that they could
                            have got off their plane and sought asylum. They had not taken advantage
                            of these opportunities.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JWH1">William Jackson</persName> stated that
                            our trouble in the matter of redefection stemmed from the fact that we
                            tried to take too much credit for the original defections. Accordingly
                            when some of the defectors redefected, the United States was placed in
                            an embarrassing position.</p>
                        <p>The President insisted that he still did not know why Communists who had
                            escaped to this country would want to return to Communism when they were
                            free to stay here. What appeal could there be to any rational mind to go
                            back to a life behind the Iron Curtain? Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> added that in any case he
                            still could see no reason for keeping any of those who wished to return
                            from leaving the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General stated his agreement with the point just made by Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_JWH1">Jackson</persName>, and suggested that
                            language to cover Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JWH1">Jackson</persName>’s
                            point be inserted in the policy paper, <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 86/1.</p>
                        <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165" facs="0195"/>
                        <p>The President again sought an answer to the question he had posed. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> replied by
                            pointing out that many of the Soviet defectors became lonely in the
                            unfamiliar environment in the United States, and were as a matter of
                            fact often unstable people who took to drink and were a considerable
                            nuisance. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> added
                            that of course there were people in the world who simply did not relish
                            the responsibilities of freedom.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then recommended
                            that <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 86/1 be re-examined by the
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board in the light of
                            this discussion. The President agreed, and indicated that this
                            reexamination should include discussion as to why the United States
                            should be so concerned about redefection. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> again pointed out the very
                            considerable intelligence benefits which we derived from defectors from
                            behind the Iron Curtain. A good start had been made on inducing such
                            defections, and he hoped that further progress would be possible.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> emphasized the
                            fact that the Soviet redefection campaign was world-wide in scope and
                            intensively pursued. This indicated that defections must be a matter of
                            very great concern to the Soviet leaders. Moreover, it reflected a grave
                            weakness in the Soviet system.</p>
                        <p>The President pointed out that in any review of the policy in <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 86/1 there should be a clear definition
                            of the advantages and disadvantages to the United States of defection
                            and redefection.</p>
                        <gap/>
                        <p>Admiral Strauss thought it would be very dangerous if word got about that
                            the United States Government would not protect defectors from being
                            shanghaied and forcibly returned to the Communist countries of their
                            origin. If such views became widespread, we could anticipate a cessation
                            of the flow of defectors. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> hastened to say that he was making no suggestion
                            that we would not protect defectors from forcible return. He had only
                            meant to suggest that if defectors voluntarily wished to return, he
                            could see no sense in our trying to keep them here in the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said he agreed
                            with the warning statement of Admiral Strauss. It is widely believed
                            that the five “Tuapse” sailors were in fact shanghaied. This belief is
                            dangerous for the United States and gives the public a completely
                            erroneous impression. On the other hand, Governor <persName
                                corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> agreed that it was all right to
                            send defectors back if they decide of their own free will that they wish
                            to return. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said
                            that above all, we must take care that no coercion is exerted by the
                            U.S. authorities.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that we
                            should frankly face the fact that as more and more changes occur in the
                            Soviet Union in the direction of liberalization, more and more defectors
                            will wish to return. Some of <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0196"
                            />the changes in the Soviet Union which had occurred in recent months
                            were obviously genuine changes. If the Soviet Union proceeds to
                            liquidate labor camps and to cease to compel its citizens to be tied to
                            their jobs, defectors will desire to go back. We should take great pains
                            not to let such a return movement be signalled as a defeat for the
                            United States in the cold war. After all, it is one of our great
                            objectives to induce Soviet Russia to become a decent member of the
                            society of nations. There is now evidence that the Soviet Union is
                            moving in that direction. We should welcome and facilitate such
                            developments, and make no issue whatever of voluntary redefection. To do
                            so would be to create a false issue. The tendency underlying the current
                            policy paper is that we should undertake to try to prevent defectors
                            from returning to their Communist homelands, and that failure to prevent
                            their return must be regarded as a defeat for U.S. policy. This was
                            fundamentally erroneous.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed agreement with the points made by Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, as did Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>. The latter pointed
                            out that it would be quite wrong to regard these very hopeful recent
                            developments in the Soviet Union as evidence that the United States is
                            being licked in the cold war.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Strauss asked whether there was any firm evidence that the Soviet
                            Union was adopting a more enlightened labor policy and would no longer
                            compel citizens to remain in jobs against their will. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that all he
                            knew on this subject he had learned from <persName>George</persName>
                            Meany, who seemed to believe that the recent decree permitting freedom
                            of movement in jobs was genuine enough. Governor <persName
                                corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> also thought that it must be a
                            genuine move, for the simple reason that the decree had been so widely
                            publicized within the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>The President said that this was quite enough to indicate the
                            desirability of reviewing the policy stated in <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 86/1. The Attorney General said that there was one last
                            aspect of the problem which he would like to bring up. It related to the
                            activities of representatives of the Soviet Government assigned to the
                            United Nations headquarters in New York. These agents of the Soviet
                            Government were certainly molesting and bringing pressure on Soviet
                            defectors and escapees. Furthermore, they were involved in espionage
                            activities. Accordingly, the Attorney General wondered whether our
                            policy respecting these individuals was sufficiently established to
                            enable us to proceed effectively against them. He invited comment on
                            this problem from the Secretary of State. Secretary <persName

                        <p>On May 17, the Operations Coordinating Board’s Special Working Group on
                            Stalinism, chaired by Deputy Assistant Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJD1">Jacob Beam</persName>, submitted to the Board for
                            transmission to the National Security Council a summary report on United
                            States policy guidance and actions to be taken to exploit the
                            anti-Stalin campaign in the Soviet Union and the Soviet bloc in Eastern
                            Europe. For text of the report, see volume XXIV, page 99.</p>
                        <p>The report listed as an objective of the campaign to exploit
                            anti-Stalinism a loosening of the ties that bound the satellites to the
                            Soviet Union and the creation of conditions which would permit the
                            evolution of independence. As part of the guidance for relevant
                            agencies, the report encouraged pressure for greater freedom in the
                            satellites and exploitation of intraparty dissension and differences
                            with the Soviet Union.</p>

                            of Winiewicz’s remarks were: Great changes are taking place in Poland,
                            other Soviet orbit countries which West and particularly USA should
                            recognize as warranting adjustments in their policies and attitudes
                            toward Poland; that Polish Government is sincerely desirous improving
                            relations with USA; that Poland cannot and should not sever its friendly
                            ties with USSR; and that there can be no return to status quo ante
                            conditions in Poland. These are not new themes with Winiewicz, but he
                            belabored his points stronger than ever. He has been talking in similar
                            vein with some other Chiefs of Mission.</p>

                                noticeable in the section on foreign affairs, where he ranted
                                against U.S. imperialism and spoke openly about alleged American
                                support of spies and saboteurs in Hungary.” (<hi rend="italic"

                            and under consideration by Department for past several weeks.</p>
                        <p>Even pessimistic locals were willing give odds that some clear-cut break
                            with past policies would be discernable in speech and that Rakosi would,
                            at the least, be forced make some concessions of substantive nature in
                            face pressures which have clearly been building up against him from
                            below and in effort smooth out some of more striking anomalies between
                            past year’s policies here and trends now observable in Soviet Union and
                            in several of other satellites. Tone and content Rakosi’s speech has
                            disappointed locals harboring even most cautious hopes and has given
                            rise even greater general discontent and disaffection towards Rakosi. It
                            has also greatly reinforced Legation’s conviction that only with
                            Rakosi’s removal will road leading to genuine liberalization be opened
                            and that our only means of assisting this is through pressure plus
                            public exposure of realities Hungarian situation under Rakosi’s
                            Stalinist rule.</p>
                        <p>Apart from these considerations, Rakosi’s pointed reference to
                            “imperialist US which continues try smuggle spies and saboteurs into our
                            country” and other gutter-like anti-US statements, particularly coming
                            after Rajk trial disavowal, Grosz rehabilitation and admissions of
                            run-away secret police activity, cannot in our view go unchallenged if
                            US is to retain respect or prestige in eyes captive peoples.</p>
                        <p>Our conversations over past month have convinced us, moreover, that there

                            well who would welcome and silently acclaim a diplomatic offensive aimed
                            against Rakosi and his secret police which they could use as leverage in
                            their current efforts effect changes here (Legtels 405<note n="3"

                            alone, I continue believe strongly that case (treated along lines

                            French and Italian cases recently given publicity have not aroused much
                            furor in West and have received no mention here. Having these previous
                            exposures on record might serve take some sting out Tiedtke case in

                            after specific request would be equivalent saying US has no grievances.

                            appear unchanged and indistinguishable from Soviet policies except for
                            certain tactical expediencies, e.g., special treatment Catholic Church,
                            peculiar to Poland and which have always emitted in post-war period.</p>
                        <p>Surface changes have been quite numerous and, to casual observers,
                            neutral-minded individuals, and visiting correspondents, probably
                            impressive. Their publicized impressions tend give air respectability to
                            Communist regime. Embassy believes importance these changes consists
                            principally in whether they contain possibility becoming irreversible
                            trend (i.e., ferment that cannot be controlled).</p>
                        <p>Perhaps most important surface change was spate criticism of regime from
                            press and radio as result greenlight received from XXth Congress <gloss
                                target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss>. Embassy believes this wave criticism
                            exceeded regime’s intention to permit, or perhaps even foster, criticism
                            cult of individual and Stalin. Noteworthy, however, that no more than
                            word from Ochab was necessary to establish firm limits to criticism.
                            Consequently, freedom criticize regime is far from irreversible trend
                            although zeal with which Poles seized opportunity demonstrates vividly
                            opportunities dormant but far from dead this field.</p>
                        <p>Criticism and “free debate” in Sejm, though vaunted in western press, was
                            much better controlled than general criticism described above, in
                            Embassy’s opinion, [and] veiled only thinly Sejm’s continuing rubber
                            stamp character. “Loyal opposition” parties (SD, ZSL and Catholic
                            Deputies) continue now almost historic subservience regime. Only move
                            during recent session approaching hostile opposition was ineffective

                            from Catholic Church. Thus, Embassy believes Sejm still completely

                            USSR in handling e.g. collectivization and church does not represent
                            “own road” but rather is matter expediency based on failure traditional

                            divergencies present long before Belgrade meeting. Although church

                            westerners, there is trickle information coming in from west (e.g. 200

                        <p>445. At Rumanian Assembly reception for visiting members Supreme Soviet I
                            had half hour talk with Gheorghiu-Dej. Present were chief delegate
                            Supreme Soviet who is General Secretary Central Committee Leningrad, and
                            Soviet Ambassador Yrpishev with Foreign Minister acting as interpreter.
                            Conversation in Russian with Soviets attentive but not
                            participating.</p>
                        <p>Dej opened discussion by asking why US against disarmament. I replied
                            this not the fact as evidenced by President’s proposals and all our
                            efforts Disarmament Subcommittee. Dej said as former naval officer I
                            must know navigation and importance steering proper course. I agreed but
                            said first duty navigator look out for shoals, particularly hidden ones
                            not appearing above surface. Dej shifted his metaphors and asked me if
                            doctor gave patient pills to cure him and patient refused pills and
                            remained ill was not patient at fault and not doctor. I replied that
                            depended upon nature pills; if pills were poison patient showed
                            justifiable intelligence not taking them. Dej said but supposing pills
                            are accepted by entire world as being a definite cure. I told him that
                            under those circumstances it wouldn’t be necessary to have doctor but
                            just buy pills and most intelligent course anyway is to take necessary
                            precautions against becoming ill.</p>
                        <pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0205"/>
                        <p>Dej said US-Rumanian relations showed improvement but were not moving
                            fast enough. He commented on fact I was permitted to travel everywhere I
                            wanted in Rumania without being followed and yet Rumanian envoys in US
                            constantly tailed. I replied this information inaccurate since on recent
                            motor trip to northern Rumania I was under constant surveillance by
                            Securitate car. He replied that possibly my professional experience as
                            prosecutor gave me preconceived notion all cars were Securitate. I told
                            him Securitate easily identified and travel restrictions were childish
                            and required only by nations lacking confidence in their international
                            security and asked him why he did not lift all travel restrictions. He
                            said that [he] would soon but emphasized our own reluctance to grant
                            visas to many Rumanians and Soviets who desired enter US.</p>
                        <p>He said it was necessary for us to get down to specifics in discussing
                            present Rumanian-US problems and set up detailed balance sheet of these
                            problems so that they could be carefully examined and discussed. I told
                            him that was exactly what US had proposed in its note<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d64fn2">The U.S. note was in response to a Romanian
                                suggestion of March 7 that economic negotiations between Romania and
                                the United States should be initiated. The discussions were to
                                concern U.S. claims against Romania, Romanian assets blocked in the
                                United States, and trade exchanges. The United States replied in a
                                note (transmitted to Bucharest in telegram 232, April 23) that it
                                would discuss these issues along with others such as the

                            from Rumanians. He looked blankly at Foreign Minister who was obviously
                            embarrassed. (Foreign Minister had earlier told me answer to US note out
                            of his hands and awaiting higher action. Prime Minister Stoica, however,
                            had later told me it was in Foreign Minister’s hands. Believe this
                            indication Politburo to date preoccupied with political matters and have
                            not yet reached question reply US note.)</p>
                        <p>Dej particularly stressed commercial relations saying it was essential
                            Rumanians obtain technical assistance and machinery necessary for its
                            development best supplied by US. He urged agreement for increased
                            technical and cultural exchanges. He emphasized Rumanians making sincere
                            effort normalize Rumanian-US relations.</p>
                        <p>Dej in particularly good humor, bubbling over with self-confidence and
                            cordiality. Insisted on having photograph taken with me and Soviet
                            Ambassador. He had spent large part evening in earnest conversation with
                            [garble—Yugo?] and Soviet Ambassadors. All members Politburo present and
                            no outward signs any international disagreements.</p>

                        <p>During the past months a number of indications have appeared that the
                            Czechoslovak Government desires to improve and extend its relations with
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>On the personal and social side, as compared with a year or two ago, the
                            Czechs are noticeably making an effort to put themselves on better
                            personal terms with representatives of the United States. This is true
                            not only of myself and members of the Embassy staff but we also note
                            that the change is making itself felt on the social side in Washington.
                            Among concrete instances there may be mentioned the behavior of Premier
                                <persName corresp="#p_SV1">Siroky</persName> who on such occasions
                            as the Liberation Day reception on May 9 or a meeting of the National
                            Assembly has taken the initiative in opening a conversation with me.
                            Deputy Premier Kopecky made a point of attending the Porgy and Bess
                            reception which Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> and
                            I gave at the Residence. He has for some time, and particularly at the
                            airport upon the arrival of the Indian Vice-President, Dr. Radhakrishman
                            and again at <persName corresp="#p_SV1">Siroky</persName>’s dinner in
                            his honor, been overwhelmingly cordial toward me and paid me unusual
                            attention. At gatherings he has gone out of his way to greet me and
                            introduce me to Czechoslovak officials. Foreign Minister David was
                            unprecedently friendly and expansive when I called on him on February 13
                            and Deputy Foreign Minister Sekaninova as well as Deputy Foreign
                            Minister Nosek and his wife have obviously endeavored to be personally
                            cordial toward my wife and myself at receptions and dinners. Sekaninova
                            and the Noseks have conducted themselves in a similar manner toward the
                            Vedelers and at concerts during the Prague Musical Festival Sekaninova
                            was noticeably forthcoming.</p>
                        <p>At receptions given by the Czechs such as that on Liberation Day and in
                            honor of the Indian Vice-President no attempt is made at segregation of
                            Westerners and Czech officials endeavor to mix with and be agreeable to

                            the dinner recently given by the Czechoslovak Ambassador at Washington
                            for members of the Department represents a new departure.</p>
                        <p>In the political sphere the Czechs changed their practice regarding
                            invitations for Liberation Day this year when for the first time in some
                            years their invitations to the reception here and apparently at a number
                            of missions abroad no longer contained the objectionable wording “in
                            celebration of the liberation of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Army”. We
                            believe that the change was made after great deliberation in order to
                            take account of our attitude as we have manifested it by our conspicuous
                            absence at their National Day celebrations during the past years. They
                            desired us to attend and acted so as to make it possible for us to do
                            so. For almost two years it was impossible in spite of repeated efforts
                            on the Embassy’s part to fly into Czechoslovakia a United States Air
                            Force plane for my travel. Within a month, however, we have obtained
                            permission for three flights (made on May 10, May 23 and June 7) even
                            though the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has reiterated on each occasion
                            the permission was not to be considered a usual diplomatic
                            privilege.</p>
                        <p>As regards travel, the Czechs are beginning to encourage tourists from
                            the United States to visit Czechoslovakia. Toward this end they
                            publicize tourist possibilities in this country, arrange tours through
                            CEDOK, the official travel agency, and sell abroad tourist
                            accommodations at reduced rates which ignore the official rate of
                            exchange. They have also acceded fully to our interpretation that under
                            the Treaty of Naturalization American citizens of Czechoslovak origin
                            naturalized since the beginning of the War are not to be considered
                            Czechoslovak citizens and treated as such while traveling in
                            Czechoslovakia. They are allowing a few visitors in exceptional cases to
                            go from Czechoslovakia to the United States. They are also granting a
                            few more exit permits for immigrants to rejoin separated families in the
                            United States. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has proposed that the
                            Embassy resume full visa services and has raised the matter of reopening
                            Czechoslovak consulates in the United States on the basis that it is
                            prepared to see the reestablishment of the American Consulate General in
                            Bratislava and the removal of limitations on the size of the Embassy
                            staff.</p>
                        <p>The attitude and conduct of the Czechs in the current economic
                            negotiations reveal a desire to see a readjustment of relations in this
                            field. The Czechoslovak officials give the impression that they are
                            aware of the costly mistake represented by the economic consequences <pb

                                xml:id="d65fn2">William N. Oatis was the Associated Press
                                correspondent in Prague when he was arrested on espionage charges in
                                April 23, 1951. He was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in
                                prison. After vigorous American protests and the blocking of
                                Czechoslovak assets in the United States, he was released on May 15,
                                1953. For documentation relating to the case, see <ref

                            serious deterioration in economic relations that characterized the
                            period 1951–54. They are unhappy that the state of economic unsettlement
                            continues and we believe that they would like to see a solution of the
                            outstanding economic issues between the two countries if the price is
                            one which they think they can bear. While they are hard bargainers and
                            have not yet offered any substantial concessions, they have carefully
                            refrained from pushing the exchange to the point of our breaking off
                            discussion. On several occasions when debate has reached a sharp point
                            they have drawn back and taken a more reasonable attitude.</p>
                        <p>It is clear from their statements both in and outside the negotiations
                            that the Czechs are interested in rebuilding their trade with the United
                            States. They would like to obtain the restoration of MFN benefits but
                            the argument that the solution of outstanding economic problems will
                            provide some stimulus to the growth of trade by creating a more
                            favorable atmosphere may have some plausibility with them in spite of
                            what they say in the economic discussions. They are of course interested
                            in the dollar income from increased trade. In addition they would
                            doubtless like to demonstrate a return to a more normal condition and an
                            ability to do as well as Poland at the present time and their
                            non-Communist precursors in Czechoslovakia.</p>
                        <p>The regime’s efforts to broaden cultural relations with the United States
                            are reflected in the sponsorship of Porgy and Bess involving a
                            considerable dollar outlay for the Ministry of Finance and the
                            invitations to American musicians to participate in the International
                            Musical Festival, to the American pianist Julius Katchen and the
                            American singer Hubert Dilworth to give a series of separate concerts in
                            Prague and provincial cities, and to American skaters and tennis stars
                            to appear in Czechoslovakia. It should be noted that the Czechs took the
                            initiative in each of these cases to bring the American performers here
                            and no official American interest was expressed in any of their visits.
                            While this involves some expected reciprocity, the Government has not
                            yet asked for much in return, apparently only seeking to arrange a tour
                            in the United States for the Smetana Quartet. As we have previously
                            reported and as we see it from the Embassy, the benefits of these
                            cultural visits are proving very much in our favor.</p>
                        <p>Since the regime must be aware in some measure of the advantages accruing
                            to the United States from cultural visits to Czechoslovakia the question
                            of course arises as to why they are permitted or even <pb n="179"
                                xml:id="pg_179" facs="0209"/>sought. The regime may consider these
                            advantages not too dangerous in comparison with the effects of admitting
                            the entry of American books, magazines and newspapers. At the same time
                            such cultural visits help the regime to gain a certain amount of
                            respectability through promoting culture, through giving some support to
                            the claim of lowering the Iron Curtain, and through giving the people
                            something that they strongly desire.</p>
                        <p>We see little if any reason to think that this interest in extending
                            cultural relations will reach in the near future to matters of a more
                            purely informational character. We have seen no indication of a
                            willingness to stop jamming or to permit the entry of Western
                            publications. There appears no imminent possibility of opening a United
                            States Information Service Library or even a substitute in the form of a
                            reference library under some other name. Whatever limited changes have
                            occurred so far since the Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of
                            the Soviet Union the regime continues to reject any concessions looking
                            toward freedom of information. The reaction to the students’ demands,
                            particularly as revealed in the recent National Conference of the
                            Communist Party, leaves no doubt on this score. The regime continues to
                            be very strict regarding any encroachments on its ideological
                            monopoly.</p>
                        <p>The main interest of the regime in improving and extending relations with
                            the United States is doubtless explained as an aspect of the Soviet
                            bloc’s campaign for peaceful coexistence and the relaxation of
                            international tension. It may be noted, however, that a number of
                            officials below the top leaders seem to welcome personally the
                            opportunity permitted by present Soviet tactics in international affairs
                            to take a more friendly attitude toward the United States and things
                            American. Many of them, like the people generally, are sick of the
                            isolation forced upon Czechoslovakia in the Stalinist period and are
                            glad to come out into the light of contacts and exchange with the West.
                            They do not like the reputation of maintaining an Iron Curtain and wish
                            to do something to rid the regime of that onus. And finally the regime
                            cannot altogether neglect the attitude of the people whose admiration
                            and affection for the United States have not diminished.</p>
                        <p>Such an attitude on the part of the Czechoslovak Government does not of
                            course prevent the secret police from maintaining surveillance over
                            Embassy staff members, installing microphones in the Chancery or other
                            American quarters and opening a secret entry to the Chancery attic.
                            These efforts of the police to ascertain intelligence about the
                            operations of the Embassy or to restrict those operations will doubtless
                            continue as long as the Communist regime exists. Nor will its efforts
                            cease to combat by both diplomatic and propaganda means balloon
                            transmissions and what it describes as American “espionage”
                            activities.</p>
                        <pb n="180" xml:id="pg_180" facs="0210"/>
                        <p>The Embassy has already suggested in a number of separate communications
                            to the Department its conclusions from these developments. It is
                            believed that advantage should be taken of them to extend our efforts to
                            settle outstanding problems in the relations of the two governments such
                            as economic issues, the imprisonment of the American citizen Jaromir
                            Zastera, exit documentation for American citizens and for close
                            relatives of American citizens. The Embassy also considers it desirable
                            to utilize such opportunities as are presented by this modification of
                            attitude to increase the influence of the United States among the
                            Czechoslovak people by facilitating the travel of Americans to
                            Czechoslovakia, encouraging the visits of recognized American artists
                            and other performers, arranging exhibits of American art, reopening the
                            Consulate General at Bratislava, resuming certain visa services, and
                            resuming payments by Treasury check to individual recipients of benefits
                            now denied them in actual effect.</p>

                                reported in the morning papers. In the first place, there was a

                                should take, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>
                                pointing out that official statements should probably not be used
                                but quotable statements from the floor of Congress might be helpful
                                as would the statements of the businessmen who come out from Poland

                        <p>The Secretary spoke about the need of spreading widely the actions and
                            claims of the USSR in its foreign aid programs because it would place
                            the USSR in the dilemma of denying the claims and thus hurting their
                            good will abroad or in affirming the claims and thus offending the
                            Soviet people themselves who were being squeezed in order to support
                            such aid programs. The Secretary went on to discuss the view he has held
                            that the Soviet economy is overextended: they are trying to match and
                            indeed surpass the U.S. military effort; they are trying to increase
                            their capital development; they are trying to develop their foreign aid
                            program. All of this in the face of a bad agricultural situation. He
                            pointed out that if the U.S., with its far greater industrial base,
                            attempted such programs it would be staggered by the load. The Secretary
                            thought there was a need for us to develop the pressures on these
                            economic vulnerabilities and that by publicizing expansively the Soviet
                            foreign aid offers forcing them into the dilemma of acknowledgment or
                            denial was an important direction in which we could go.</p>
                        <p>Discussion shifted to the appropriate utilization of the barter amendment

                                >Hill</persName> thought might be passed within ten days or so. The
                            Secretary felt that we could develop an offer to the Poles, as well as
                            to other satellites, which would be very appealing and which the USSR
                            would now allow.</p>
                        <p>There was also discussion prompted by the Secretary’s report of Senator
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s inquiry to him as
                            to whether the world shortage of cement might be a commodity we could
                            usefully seek from the USSR and the satellites in our barter offers.</p>

                        <p>As an aside during the discussion, the Secretary spoke eloquently on the
                            need to take risks in the development of our policies, especially if we
                            are to be “on the offensive”. Nothing is achieved that does not have
                            some risk to it and we should not seek to make all our programs
                            riskless. He pointed out that the coordination process often is
                            deadening in this regard as each participant seeks to remove possible
                            dangers.</p>

                            it is pretty important to set it up so it does not look like propaganda.

                            Poznan riots understandably disagree many details. However, broadest
                            outlines based above sources seem fairly well established although
                            definite verification lacking several points. Following is composite
                            picture based all sources.</p>
                        <p>Regime admits that as result recent cut wages and inability support
                            selves Zispo (Stalin Works) workers sent delegation Warsaw recently make
                            “just demands” re betterment economic status. Delegation allegedly
                            delivered ultimatum that continuation status quo would result
                            demonstration Poznan. Bureaucratic regime apparently did nothing or at
                            least moved too slowly to suit workers.</p>
                        <p>Consequently, demonstration began about 0800 June 28 as peaceful demand
                            betterment material life workers and, according to some reports, demand

                            time reportedly imprisoned Poznan. Large number students and children
                            were in the crowd.</p>

                            Embassy’s estimate basic and immediate causes Poznan demonstrations,
                            subject change as additional information becomes available.</p>
                        <p>Workers J. Stalin Metal Factory Poznan planned demonstration Thursday,
                            June 28 (Embassy telegram 9) as protest economic conditions and possibly
                            against imprisonment workers delegation. Demonstration as economic
                            affair apparently planned considerably in advance, culmination long
                            brewing dispute workers over decreased pay scales (even previously low),
                            bad working conditions, lack overtime pay and alleged ineptitude
                            management. Possible that workers intentionally scheduled demonstration
                            during Poznan Fair to impress foreigners with economic facts of life
                            Poland. While bread shortage mentioned among slogans during
                            demonstration, Embassy believes this merely symbolic inability workers
                            procure necessities life with low pay scales, prevailing high prices.
                            Other food items such as fruits, vegetables, dairy products currently in
                            equally short supply and high priced (seasonal situation this time year
                            before crops). High prices clothing, shoes also frequent cause
                            grumbling. (Embassy believes no basic food shortage exists; problem is
                            rather gap between food prices and wage level urban dwellers and
                            workers.)</p>
                        <p>Demonstration by workers re economic grievances fanned into riot with
                            hastily improvised political slogans by combination circumstances cited
                            Embassy telegram 9.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, presence many foreigners Poznan and contrast Polish austerity
                            with foreign wealth (apparent in foreign cars downtown as well as in
                            foreign consumers goods exhibited at fair), Polish export consumers
                            goods exhibited at fair but not available domestic consumption, all
                            likely serve increase dissatisfaction Poznan residents this time. No
                            concrete indication this second phase demonstration planned in advance.
                            Banners with political slogans apparently hastily prepared as
                            demonstration gained headway; arms in hands demonstrators reportedly
                            obtained police, army or Stalin Factory after rioting began.</p>
                        <pb n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0218"/>
                        <p>In short Embassy believes demonstration began as workers grievance
                            meeting but soon developed into opportunity display not only
                            dissatisfaction economic conditions but also display such basic
                            sentiments as hostility USSR and Poles desire independence.</p>
                        <p>Some diplomats (recalling Communist strategy and tactics in past)
                            speculating regime elements planned riots one or other ulterior
                            purposes, viz: (1) Anti-Ochab elements instigated disturbance as means
                            discrediting Ochab and forcing him and cohorts from regime; (2) regime
                            itself fostered riot to provide excuse for repressing public which was
                            getting out of hand as result “liberalization”; (3) security police
                                (<gloss target="#t_UB1">UB</gloss>) purposely tantalized crowd in
                            order convert peaceful demonstration into riot giving <gloss
                                target="#t_UB1">UB</gloss> chance reinstitute more repression and
                            regain its former prestige and autonomy which suffered under
                            de-Stalinization.</p>
                        <p>Since Ochab apparently hated even by regime colleagues and tainted brush
                            Stalin, he and followers could well lose positions as immediate result
                            riot. It does not follow, however, that his enemies would resort to
                            highly dangerous expedient fostering riot which might easily get out of
                            hand in country like Poland where majority people bitterly
                            anti-regime.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, even if Ochab’s enemies willing take this chance, Poznan would
                            not likely be chosen as locale at time when hundreds Western businessmen
                            there to carry back eyewitness reports very damaging to regime.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, regime itself unlikely take risk serious riots and unfavorable
                            publicity only to provide excuse reinstate more repressive measures.
                            Regime has probably learned past 11 years that repression is one
                            principal factor antagonizing public whose resentment clearly evident
                            many ways, including lethargic response contribution to failure economy
                            operate. Government may, of course, institute more repressive measures,
                            if they appear necessary but Embassy believes this would be done only as
                            last resort. In any event, it would not signify that regime planned
                            riots to provide excuse reinstate more repression.</p>
                        <p>Thesis number 3 somewhat more plausible. <gloss target="#t_UB1"
                                >UB</gloss> probably does resent loss former power and autonomy and
                            some of its more irresponsible elements might have provoked crowd
                            purposely. However, such action would be spur of moment spark rather
                            than planned cause per se.</p>

                            been widely disseminated abroad. These statements included eye-witness
                            accounts of the riots in Poznan and pointed up the fact that the riots
                            were based on dissatisfaction of workers with the Communist regime. The
                            US Government’s offer of food to relieve the distress in Poland had also
                            been given wide publicity.</p>
                        <p>The fact that the Communist regime would be judged throughout the world

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> commented that the
                            demonstrations were the only means of expression of the workers. . . .
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> commented that we
                            should maintain a propaganda offensive in the face of Soviet efforts to
                            pin the riots on the United States. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName>, commenting on the fact that the riots were labor
                            demonstrations, inquired whether international labor had taken up the
                            matter. If not, he thought the ICFTU might be encouraged to protest in
                            the name of international labor. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJD1"
                                >Beam</persName> commented that a factual hour-by-hour report on the
                            development and progress of the riots would be ready within a couple of
                            days and could be turned into valuable publicity. Mr. <persName

                            possible, we should encourage such projects as petitions for free
                            elections in Poland and other Satellite countries; also encourage the
                            exchange of information regarding disturbances. He felt that the
                            demonstrations should be regarded in the light of the right of labor to
                            appeal impossible labor conditions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"

                                    or threat of force, it is unlikely that Soviet ability to

                                    death of Stalin—particularly the introduction of collective
                                    leadership, Moscow’s acceptance of Titoism and acknowledgment
                                    that there are “different roads to Socialism”, and the
                                    denigration of Stalin—are being reflected in current satellite
                                    developments. These developments have varied in pace and scope
                                    in each of the satellites and are continuing, but common to them
                                    all are a reduction in the role of the secret police embodied in
                                    the emphasis on the need for “socialist legality” and the
                                    admission of past errors attributed to the “cult of
                                    personality”. Some personnel changes have occurred at the top in
                                    certain satellite governments and others may follow. Although
                                    the basic political and economic policies and objectives have
                                    not been successfully challenged nor the fundamental subjection

                                    there are indications that Moscow now recognizes the advantage
                                    of using greater flexibility as well as more camouflage in its
                                    control of the satellites, and of giving them certain latitude
                                    or responsibility of decision on matters of local detail within
                                    the general framework of Soviet bloc policy.</item>

                                <item>Nationalism in the satellites, even within the Communist
                                    movement itself, remains a disruptive force in Soviet-satellite
                                    relations. There is a real and growing split in most satellite
                                    parties between those amenable to close Soviet control and the
                                    “national Communists”. However, since the combination of basic
                                    factors which made possible the successful Yugoslav break with
                                    Moscow is lacking in the satellites, it is unlikely that the
                                    Yugoslav experience will be repeated in any of them. Moreover,
                                    by its reconciliation with Tito, Moscow has sought with some
                                    success to neutralize the competing attraction originally
                                    exercised on the satellite governments by Belgrade’s independent
                                    position and policies.</item>

                                    provides a standing example of successful defiance of the
                                    Kremlin and a demonstration that the West is prepared to assist
                                    nationalistic Communist leaders to assert their independence of
                                    Moscow. Despite Moscow’s apparent reconciliation with Belgrade,
                                    it may be still possible to exploit Yugoslavia’s unique position
                                    in promoting future changes in the Soviet satellite

                                    East and West would be an important asset in promoting possible

                                    and subsequently, arises in part from their German policy and in
                                    part from their regard for Eastern Germany as an advanced
                                    position for control of the satellite area. These considerations
                                    provide strong Soviet incentives for postponing an agreement on
                                    German reunification. The inability of the West to make the
                                    satellite issue an agenda item at the negotiating table or to
                                    offer substantial promise of the early elimination of Soviet
                                    control depresses the hopes of the satellite peoples for freedom
                                    and reduces their will to resist, thereby increasing the
                                    tendency to accept accommodation with Moscow.</item>

                                <item>Nevertheless, Eastern Germany poses a special and more
                                    difficult problem of control for the USSR than do the other
                                    satellites. While the Eastern German regime has made some
                                    progress with the program of basic industrial development and
                                    socialization, and while there are various factors operating to
                                    weaken resistance of the Eastern German population to the
                                    Communist regime, there is little likelihood that the East
                                    Germans can be brought to accept the Communist system imposed on
                                    them. The fact that the main body of the German nation in the
                                    Federal Republic has made considerable advances in freedom and
                                    well-being, and the fact that West Berlin provides a means of
                                    contact with the Free World, serve to keep alive in Eastern
                                    Germany the hope for an escape from Soviet domination. The
                                    situation in East Germany provides opportunities for the West to
                                    continue to exploit strong popular anti-Communism, to maintain
                                    East Germany as a focal point and example of disaffection for
                                    the rest of the Soviet satellites, and to make difficult full
                                    utilization by the Soviet Union of East Germany’s economic
                                    resources.</item>

                                    have created difficulties in Soviet relations with the
                                    satellites; they have raised questions as to the infallibility
                                    of Soviet leadership among important elements of the satellite
                                    Communist parties; they have aroused to varying degrees latent
                                    popular aspirations for relaxation of oppression, restoration of
                                    national independence, and the establishment of governments
                                    responsive to popular will. This fluid situation in the
                                    satellites has increased the previously limited U.S.
                                    capabilities to influence a basic change in Soviet domination of
                                    the satellites. Although the Eastern European peoples continue
                                    to feel that liberation is remote, they remain responsive to our
                                    interest in their independence, <pb n="194" xml:id="pg_194"

                                    There is a possibility that an internal relaxation might result
                                    in the long run in the development of forces and pressures

                        <p>5. At 4 July reception Gheorghiu-Dej engaged me in long conversation on
                            variety of topics.</p>
                        <p>He opened by inquiring impression General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1"
                                >Twining</persName> had received from observation “Soviet air
                                might.”<note n="2" xml:id="d74fn2">U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff
                                General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Nathan F. Twining</persName>
                                was in the Soviet Union at the invitation of the Soviet Government
                                to view the extensive ceremonies marking Soviet Air Force Day, June
                                24.</note> I said I had not seen report but assumed he must have had
                            interesting trip. He stressed such visits important. I suggested our
                            Army Attaché would be interested see Rumanian military and air force
                            installations access to which he had not so far been permitted. Dej
                            replied Rumanian military and air force so small could not be of much
                            interest to great country like United States. However, saw no reason why
                            this could not be arranged.</p>
                        <p>I asked him how he felt about Tito’s visit.<note n="3" xml:id="d74fn3"
                                >Tito visited Romania June 24–26, after an extensive visit to the
                                Soviet Union, June 2–23.</note> He said it was enormous success and
                            of tremendous importance since it showed how countries building
                            socialism could completely resolve their differences peacefully. I
                            pointed out some countries like Poland were having serious difficulties
                            building socialism. He dismissed Polish situation as small matter of
                            economic adjustment which had been taken advantage of by some elements
                            hostile to socialism. I asked him what he thought of rumors that
                            Stalinist elements in Poland had fomented outburst in order prove their
                            point that too quick relaxation tensions might have disastrous
                            consequences. Gheorghiu-Dej said to interpreter in <pb n="195"
                                xml:id="pg_195" facs="0225"/>Rumanian “I will not discuss this
                            question further,” which interpreter translated to me as “I do not
                            believe there is yet sufficient information on Polish question to
                            justify such rumors.”</p>
                        <p>He immediately launched into question of exchange agricultural attacheś.
                            I told him I understood basis for Rumanian suggestion agricultural
                            attaché exchange was desire keep abreast American agricultural
                            processes. He agreed. I pointed out Dumitru visa granted and visits
                            already exchanged to each other’s agricultural areas and saw no reason
                            for necessity establishing rigid formality of attaché exchange.
                            Furthermore, I emphasized that creation of new diplomatic relationships
                            must necessarily depend upon more normal general relationships between
                            our two countries. I said that it was ridiculous in midst of all these
                            protestations of friendship for United States and desire for closer
                            relations to have my Legation staff constantly trailed by secret police
                            wherever they went and refused permission to travel wherever they wanted
                            to in Rumania. Dej thereupon engaged Foreign Minister in earnest
                            whispered conversation and promptly said, “there is no reason why these
                            things cannot be eliminated.” I said that furthermore we should be
                            permitted to have reading room and disseminate accurate information on
                            United States to Rumanian people who now only read false and absurd
                            statements made about United States in Rumanian newspapers. Although I
                            convinced Rumanian people did not believe what they read they remained
                            completely in dark re current developments in American life. Dej
                            launched into tirade against <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> broadcasts. I made usual reply
                            that jamming prevented me listening to broadcasts and was unaware their
                            content. Dej smiled and said that he was sure I knew very well that
                            jamming was completely ineffective and that vast majority of Rumanian
                            people were listening to these broadcasts, but fortunately information
                            they received was being corrected by Rumanian radio and other media. I
                            replied that I had told Foreign Minister who nodded assent I would be
                            glad to take up any factual misstatements made by <gloss
                                target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> but United States Government had no
                            control over <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>. He asked where <gloss
                                target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> money was coming from and I replied
                            voluntary contributions from American people who have strong sympathy
                            for inability Rumanian people to obtain information of what is going on
                            in world. I remarked Rumanians knew nothing of present Polish situation
                            since Polish newspapers banned for last two months. Dej said this
                            internal affair with which United States not concerned. I said I had
                            heard many expressions of friendship from him and other Government
                            officials but that it was time to produce actions rather than words. He
                            said Rumanian Government had made many gestures recently toward United
                            States and I replied it was time stop making unimportant gestures in
                            small matters and that Rumanian Government should show by some
                            substantive fact such as granting permission to United States to open
                            reading <pb n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0226"/>room, that it was
                            sincere in its profession of friendship. I reminded him that effects of
                            10 years of bad relationships would not be overcome by words or gestures
                            but only by meaningful action.</p>
                        <p>Gheorghiu-Dej then proceeded make elaborate statement on importance of
                            satisfying desires of Rumanian people for close economic, agricultural
                            and cultural ties with United States. I said that U.S. people had great
                            difficulty in believing that Rumanian people were independent and free
                            to express their desires or that Rumanian Government itself was free to
                            act without Soviet direction. I said if Gheorghiu-Dej could give me any
                            specific facts indicating this was not the fact which I might report to
                            my Government I was sure it would have tremendous effect upon our
                            relations. He replied he knew there were certain circles in United
                            States who had created word “satellites” and insisted on using it in an
                            effort to undermine natural friendship existing between Rumanians and
                            Soviets and that he was not interested in catering to views these few
                            people, but he was sure that majority of American people were familiar
                            with independence Rumanian people had finally obtained after many
                            hundreds of years of occupation by foreign powers and interests. He
                            proceeded into ideological discussion winding up with statement
                            Americans must see inevitability of eventual triumph of socialism even
                            in United States itself. I told him I doubted he really understood
                            American system and emphasized rigidity of Communists’ insistence that
                            theirs is only perfect system. I said I was willing agree there were
                            imperfections in American system but we were progressive people and
                            constantly changing system and improving it. I was convinced Communist
                            system was in process of undergoing first of many inevitable changes and
                            assumed Rumania would keep pace with these changes. Gheorghiu-Dej agreed
                            his system not perfect but denied there would be any substantial changes
                            in Communist system based as it was on entirely different concept of man
                            and approach world problems.</p>
                        <p>In further discussion he again pressed upon me agricultural attaché idea
                            and emphasized there should be no difficulty in our getting together on
                            normalization diplomatic relations.</p>
                        <p>Above conversation dispersed with much friendly banter and exchange of
                            barbs conducted in atmosphere of cordiality.</p>
                        <p>Gheorghiu-Dej was accompanied by almost entire Politburo including

                            action on the Poznan riots. As was indicated in our meeting with you

                                Staff Meeting of July 5, 9:15 a.m., IO was directed to “prepare for

                            for use in public statements. However, should it become necessary for
                            the Department to issue a public statement, I believe we can reexamine

                                <item>Article 2(7) of the Charter states that the United Nations is
                                    not authorized to intervene in matters essentially within the
                                    domestic jurisdiction of any state. A majority of Members,
                                    including the colonial powers who desire to maintain intact the
                                    application of Article 2(7) to colonial issues, could be
                                    expected to regard the Polish situation as essentially a
                                    domestic problem. Their position would be modified only if we
                                    could show conclusively that the situation in Poland actually
                                    threatens international peace and security. Moreover, even if we
                                    could successfully overcome their arguments in this instance, it
                                    would open the way to requests from the Communist bloc and from
                                    the Afro-Asian states to consider other matters also of a

                                    situations elsewhere. The Latin American states, for example,
                                    frequently have to cope with mob action and would be unlikely to
                                    favor any action suggesting <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>

                        <p>1. The satellites are of importance in the current balance of power in
                            Europe because they augment the political, military and economic power
                            of the Soviet Union and extend Soviet power into the heart of Europe.
                            The permanent consolidation of Soviet control in this area would
                            represent a serious threat to the security of Western Europe and the
                            United States. It is our traditional policy to recognize and support the
                            right of all peoples to independence and to governments of their own
                            choosing. The elimination of Soviet domination of the satellites is,
                            therefore, in the fundamental interest of the United States.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Soviet Domination of the
                                Satellites</hi></p>
                        <p>2. Soviet domination of the satellites remains a basic fact; there is no
                            evidence that Moscow’s ability to control them has been fundamentally
                            affected by anything that has happened since the death of Stalin. While
                            it rests in the last analysis on Soviet military domination of Eastern
                            Europe, the immediate basis of Moscow’s control is the reliable
                            Communist leadership in each satellite, flanked by Soviet advisers in
                            the state apparatus and armed forces and by a Soviet-supervised security
                            police system. A contributing factor is the high degree of
                            Soviet-satellite economic interdependence systematically developed since
                            the war. In East Germany a large Soviet military occupation force
                            furnishes an added element of control, without which the Communist
                            government might be unable to maintain the populace in subjection; this
                            was demonstrated when Soviet military force was required to suppress the
                            1953 riots. The smaller Soviet forces, totaling around 100,000, which
                            are stationed in Poland, Hungary and Rumania are probably not essential
                            to the maintenance of Soviet control over those countries; in them (as
                            in Albania, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria, where no Soviet forces are
                            stationed) what counts is rather Moscow’s over-all military ability to
                            dominate the region.</p>
                        <p>3. The Kremlin has pushed forward with considerable success its plans to
                            expand the industrial and military capabilities of the satellites and to
                            coordinate their Sovietized political system, military establishments
                            and economies with those of the USSR in a working totality. While
                            tending on the whole to bind the individual satellites separately to the
                            USSR, Moscow has permitted programs of cultural, economic and technical
                            collaboration among them. Through such devices as the Council of Mutual
                            Economic Assistance (<gloss target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss>) and the
                            Warsaw <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0230"/>Security Pact it has
                            geared them collectively with one another and with the USSR for specific
                            economic and military purposes. To all intents and purposes the
                            satellites are as much at Moscow’s disposal, economically, politically
                            and militarily, as if they were formally member-republics of the USSR.
                            On the other hand, the convenience to Moscow of their nominally
                            independent status for purposes of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            activity (Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Rumania were admitted to the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in 1955), foreign trade promotion,
                            propaganda, and other roles abroad, makes the actual incorporation of
                            any of the satellites in the USSR appear unlikely in the foreseeable
                            future.</p>

                        <p>4. The great majority of the population in each satellite continues to be
                            deeply dissatisfied with the Communist regime, resenting the hard living
                            conditions and lack of personal freedom for which the regime is held
                            responsible. Aggrieved religious feelings resulting from Communist
                            attacks on the churches have also served to intensify this widespread
                            anti-Communism. The dissident majorities are, however, not in a position
                            to develop active resistance of a kind which would seriously challenge
                            Soviet control. Nevertheless, by passive resistance they have long
                            impeded and undoubtedly will continue to impede the process of
                            Sovietization, and they form the main element on which must be based
                            eventual elimination of Soviet domination. At the same time, however, if
                            the process of exclusive Communist indoctrination and education of the
                            young proceeds without interruption and if Moscow continues its new
                            policy of allowing the satellites greater latitude in the conduct of
                            their own affairs, the prevailing anti-regime sentiment may be
                            jeopardized over the long run.</p>
                        <p>5. In addition to anti-Communism per se, nationalism is a significant
                            factor of opposition to Soviet control in all the satellites. These
                            peoples will not reconcile themselves in a few years to the loss of
                            national independence, a disregard of national traditions and the
                            enforced glorification of the USSR. The nationalist sentiment focuses on
                            the memory of better times in the past, hopes for the future, and the
                            resentment felt at the injuries and insults experienced under the
                            present regime. In many respects it is the strongest leverage available
                            for strengthening the morale of the satellite populations, sustaining
                            their spirit of resistance to Soviet imperialism, and encouraging their
                            opposition to servile Communist regimes. Nationalism is, however, a
                            double-edged weapon, raising a number of operational problems, as we
                            have discovered in our propaganda work and dealings with the refugees.
                            Besides arousing anti-Soviet feeling, nationalist sentiment also creates
                            divisions among these peoples themselves, Magyars against Slavs and
                            Rumanians, Slovaks against Czechs, Poles against Germans, <pb n="201"
                                xml:id="pg_201" facs="0231"/>and Germans against the Slavs. A
                            problem which will become increasingly serious as nationalist sentiment
                            ferments is that of the Polish-occupied areas of Germany east of the
                            Oder–Neisse line.</p>
                        <p>6. Since the death of Stalin the new Soviet leadership has tried certain
                            new approaches in its rule of the satellites. There has been a trend
                            away from the enforced uniformity of the Stalin era, and more emphasis
                            on individual satellite problems and local ways of carrying out
                            socialization within the general framework of Communist dogma. The purge
                            of Beria has been reflected in the satellites in a greater degree of
                            subordination of their police apparatuses to Party control, and in a
                            toning down of some of the more arbitrary and terroristic police-state
                            practices of the Stalin era. Along with an increasing propaganda
                            emphasis on “socialist legality” in the treatment of the ordinary
                            citizen by the state, there has been a tendency to amnesty imprisoned
                            opposition elements. In foreign relations the Soviet bloc has begun to
                            encourage tourism, to expand cultural relations, and to urge the study
                            of non-Soviet as well as Soviet achievements. In these and other ways it
                            has sought to create the feeling that its increasing strength and
                            stability justify a more confident and conciliatory approach to its own
                            peoples and to other countries than in the past. In the economic sphere
                            the USSR has gradually cut down its direct participation in the
                            satellite economies by liquidating all but a few of its holdings of
                            satellite industrial properties both in and outside of the
                            Soviet-satellite joint companies. The satellites have been allowed to
                            relax their previous over-emphasis on heavy industrial development and
                            devote more resources to agriculture. They have been encouraged both to
                            develop more economic interdependence through coordination of planning
                            and development of regional specialization among themselves, and to
                            expand trade with the free world. All evidence so far points to Soviet
                            confidence in the maintenance of its economic power over the satellites
                            under this new regime. The USSR still has ample diplomatic and party
                            mechanisms for overseeing satellite economic programs, and still
                            dominates the trade of each satellite, thus maintaining their prime
                            economic dependence on the USSR. The USSR, furthermore, oversees their
                            inter-satellite economic relations, and probably also their economic
                            approaches to the free world, through the mechanism of the
                            Soviet-dominated Council of Mutual Economic Assistance (<gloss
                                target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>7. Accompanying these developments over the past months has been a sense
                            of relaxation which in varying degrees, depending on the circumstances
                            in each country, has in general given the population a greater feeling
                            of ease and personal security. Moreover, the denigration of Stalin and
                            Moscow’s acceptance of Titoism have created difficulties in Soviet
                            relations with the satellites; they have raised questions as to the
                            infallibility of Soviet leadership among important elements of the
                            satellite Communist parties; they have aroused to <pb n="202"
                                xml:id="pg_202" facs="0232"/>varying degrees latent popular
                            aspiration for relaxation of oppression, restoration of national
                            independence, and the establishment of governments responsive to popular
                            will. As a result, criticism of the regime and its policies, first
                            encouraged as Communist “self-criticism”, has appeared in a number of
                            the satellites and has undoubtedly gone beyond the bounds originally
                            envisaged by those in authority. The intelligentsia, in particular, have
                            seized this opportunity to express in vehement terms diverse criticisms
                            of the regimes and their policies. The recent Writers’ Congresses in
                            Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary offer strikingly similar examples of
                            this phenomenon; the May demonstrations of Czech students and the
                            resolutions adopted at Czech student meetings are other examples. This
                            has led the regimes to seek to impose definite limits on criticism,
                            which they saw was leading to questioning of basic policies and even
                            Communist doctrine itself, and they have already threatened a crackdown
                            where those limits were exceeded. However, it may be expected that the
                            Eastern European intelligentsia will seek to utilize to the fullest
                            opportunities for free expression and that they will exert pressure on
                            the regimes for more freedom.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Possibilities of “Titoism”</hi></p>
                        <p>8. Nationalism in the satellites, even within the Communist movement
                            itself, remains a disruptive force in Soviet-satellite relations. There
                            is a real and growing split in most satellite parties between those
                            amenable to close Soviet control and the “national Communists”. However,
                            since the combination of basic factors which made possible the
                            successful Yugoslav break with Moscow is lacking in the satellites, it
                            is unlikely that the Yugoslav experience will be repeated in any of
                            them. Moreover, by its reconciliation with Tito, Moscow has sought with
                            some success to neutralize the competing attraction originally exercised
                            on the satellite governments by Belgrade’s independent position and
                            policies.</p>
                        <p>9. Tito is unique among the European satellite leaders in the degree of
                            power that he achieved independently. He created an impressive military
                            force, as well as a political organization, responsive to his own
                            leadership which maintained itself inside Yugoslavia during the war and
                            which, following withdrawal of the German forces, possessed the
                            requisite power to impose its will upon the Yugoslav people without
                            substantial assistance from the Soviet Army. Only the Hoxha regime in
                            Albania achieved a similar success, on a much smaller scale. All the
                            other Communist regimes were placed in power by the Soviet Army itself
                            or by the threat of force which the Soviet Army represented. These
                            regimes, therefore, were from the outset dependent on Soviet military
                            power for their existence and have remained so. In East Germany, Poland,
                            Hungary and Rumania the physical presence of <pb n="203" xml:id="pg_203"
                                facs="0233"/>sizable Soviet forces bears daily witness to Soviet
                            domination of these satellites. In Poland the Minister of National
                            Defense is a Soviet marshal, and Soviet officers occupy many of the
                            higher posts throughout the Polish armed forces. In all the satellites
                            there are Soviet military missions, some of them large, which supervise
                            the build-up and Sovietization of the satellite armed forces, and Soviet
                            advisers and technicians hold key positions in these forces as well as
                            in the defense ministries.</p>
                        <p>10. In contrast to the leadership in the other satellites, Tito preserved
                            exclusive control over his state security apparatus. His security forces
                            were built up on the basis of personal loyalty demonstrated throughout
                            the crucial wartime resistance struggle, and Tito knew that he could
                            trust the overwhelming majority of the higher echelons of his command.
                            In other satellites the security organs were created with a large
                            measure of Soviet assistance and participation which continues to this
                            day. In contrast, Tito steadfastly denied the Soviet liaison officials
                            uncontrolled access to his security organization, a fact which
                            contributed much to the friction that later reached its climax in the
                            break between Tito and the Kremlin.</p>
                        <p>11. Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Rumania have a common land
                            frontier with the USSR. Bulgaria has a common sea frontier. These states
                            are accordingly more exposed to Soviet military intervention and hence
                            more readily susceptible to Soviet pressure and control than was
                            Yugoslavia, which shares no common frontier with the USSR. Furthermore,
                            with Yugoslavia’s long sea coast facing the West, greater possibilities
                            to obtain material support from the Western powers in the event of a
                            break with Moscow were available to Tito than there would be to the
                            other satellites, with the exception of Albania.</p>
                        <p>12. Following Tito’s defection in 1948 Stalin took stringent and thorough
                            measures to guard against any similar development in other satellites.
                            Leaders in whom any taint of independence was suspected were either
                            shorn of all power, imprisoned, or liquidated. Sovietization was
                            accelerated. The customary security safeguards were tightened and
                            expanded, and contacts with the West restricted. A series of bilateral
                            mutual assistance pacts was created among most of the satellites and
                            between them and the USSR, signifying that they would go to each other’s
                            aid in case of action from without—a commitment which in 1955 was
                            transformed into a multilateral security pact embracing all of the
                            satellites and the USSR and providing for a joint military command. The
                            resultant relationship between the USSR and the satellites made it
                            appear highly probable that the Soviet leaders could count on the
                            satellite regimes to stay under their control, and that any unforeseen
                            local challenge to that control would precipitate swift Soviet
                            intervention.</p>
                        <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0234"/>
                        <p>13. The safeguards built up by Stalin against satellite Titoism have in
                            general retained their effectiveness up to now. Viewed together with the
                            geographic difficulties, they make the chances appear negligible that
                            any existing satellite Communist regime would or could break away from
                            Moscow under its own power or that any anti-Soviet faction could seize
                            or hold power in a satellite and bring about its detachment from the
                            Soviet bloc.</p>
                        <p>14. Albania represents a partial exception, albeit an extremely
                            hypothetical one, in that, unlike the other satellites, it is
                            geographically isolated from the rest of the Soviet bloc and has close
                            access to the West by sea. However, this circumstance and the
                            potentiality of the anti-Communist majority of the Albanian population
                            for action against Soviet rule are offset by the current strength of the
                            regime. The present Albanian leaders are loyal to the Kremlin and rule
                            the country with an effective security apparatus. It is clear that they
                            prefer allegiance to distant Moscow, without whose economic aid they
                            could not exist for any length of time, to domination by some nearer
                            neighbor. An important factor militating against any Albanian move away
                            from the Soviet orbit is the bitter rivalry with respect to Albania of
                            its three neighbors—Italy, Yugoslavia and Greece.</p>
                        <p>15. Nationalism may, nevertheless, continue to be a disruptive force
                            within the Communist movement, open to exploitation by the United
                            States. The fact that Moscow and the satellite Communist parties are
                            giving increasing lip-service to the principle of national autonomy and
                            diversity shows that they are conscious of its importance in the popular
                            mind and would like to twist it to their own advantage. Writers,
                            teachers, scientists, technicians, artists, and similar elements on whom
                            the regime depends to help implement its program, are apt to be deeply
                            imbued with the national tradition, or keenly aware of the local
                            problems, and impatient of limitations or controls dictated by the
                            requirements of distant Moscow or of Soviet-imposed policies. Even
                            within the regime itself, not all satellite Communists are able or
                            willing to serve Moscow’s interest without any regard for that of their
                            own nation; the very problems of governing their respective territories
                            and of meeting the goals which have been set seem to require at least a
                            minimum of cooperation from the people and may lead certain local
                            Communists to oppose as best they can those Kremlin demands and policies
                            which put too great a strain upon their own position. Moreover if the
                            Soviet leaders, out of awareness of these satellite stresses and
                            strains, permit somewhat more local flexibility so as to ease the task
                            of their satellite protégés, it is conceivable that such flexibility
                            might at some point tend to get out of hand, inspire wider unrest, and
                            even impair the general effectiveness of Soviet control. The latter
                            possibility, however, so far appears to be remote.</p>

                        <p>16. Even though no other satellite has followed or seems capable of
                            following the path of Tito’s Yugoslavia under existing conditions, the
                            Yugoslav example continues to be a significant factor in the satellite
                            picture. Tito’s success in maintaining Yugoslavia’s independence
                            constitutes a reflection on the past political competence and
                            infallibility of the Soviet leadership. His political and ideological
                            counter-offensive has been a disturbing factor within the satellite
                            Communist parties. He has provided an example of a Communist alternative
                            to Soviet domination. Though he has latterly tended to swing partly away
                            from the Western allies, including Greece and Turkey, his close
                            relationship with the Western allies has undoubtedly made a strong
                            impression on the satellite peoples. The mere fact of substantial U.S.
                            economic and military assistance to Yugoslavia has had an effect on both
                            Communists and non-Communists in the satellites.</p>
                        <p>17. In connection with its new, conciliatory tactics toward Tito over the
                            past year, Moscow has caused the satellites to cease their criticism of
                            him and to adopt a conciliatory posture. Some of them have gone so far
                            as to repudiate formally the charge of “Titoism” that was included in
                            the indictment of certain of their major purge victims executed in
                            1949–52. Nevertheless, the Yugoslav leaders so far have moved slowly and
                            cautiously with respect to the reestablishment of contacts with the
                            Communist parties of the Soviet Union or the satellites. The Soviet
                            Government, for its part, has been in no hurry to reshuffle satellite
                            leaders who are distasteful to Tito; most of the satellites are still
                            headed by Communists who spoke out strongest against him in 1948–53,
                            such as Rakosi in Hungary, Hoxha and Shehu in Albania, and Gheorghiu-Dej
                            in Rumania. One such leader, Chervenkov in Bulgaria, was recently
                            removed, although internal party reasons also appeared to play a role in
                            his ouster;<note n="2" xml:id="d76fn2">Vulko Chervenkov was demoted from

                        <p>18. Since 1945 none of the organized political émigré groups from the
                            Eastern European countries have been recognized by any of the free world
                            countries as governments-in-exile. The passage of time, the
                            proliferation of exile organizations, and the diverse voices raised to
                            claim to represent the views of the peoples behind the Iron Curtain,
                            have tended to discourage Eastern European political leaders and to
                            diminish the effectiveness of their émigré organizations. In recognition
                                <pb n="206" xml:id="pg_206" facs="0236"/>of this trend, the exile
                            leaders joined forces in 1954 to create the Assembly of Captive European
                            Nations (<gloss target="#t_ACEN1">ACEN</gloss>) in order to provide a
                            unified and cohesive forum for their national voices. Through periodic
                            deliberations and actions in this forum, the exiles have been able to
                            attract more serious attention of the U.S. and foreign press and of the
                            free world statesmen, and thus the <gloss target="#t_ACEN1">ACEN</gloss>
                            has become to date the most effective device of the Eastern European
                            political exiles to exercise influence on and expound their views before
                            public opinion outside and within the Iron Curtain.</p>
                        <p>19. For the past year or more the Soviet Union and satellite governments
                            have conducted an intensified “redefection” campaign aimed at rendering
                            ineffective and, if possible, eliminating the organized activities
                            abroad of the political exiles. Although few exiles have been persuaded
                            to return to their native countries (1158 known cases in the period
                            January 1955–March 1956), this campaign has had a disturbing
                            psychological effect in exile circles. The United States has countered
                            this Soviet action with a program emphasizing (a) increased material
                            assistance to escapees, (b) a propaganda counter-offensive, and (c)
                            protection and security of the émigrés. The United States should
                            continue to combat by all feasible means Soviet redefection efforts and
                            should encourage and assist the exiles in opposing the redefection
                            campaign.</p>

                        <p>20. The means available to the United States to assist opposition to, and
                            the eventual breakdown of, Soviet domination of the satellites fall into
                            the following general categories: (a) political and diplomatic; (b)
                            economic; (c) propaganda; (d) covert; and (e) military. It must be
                            recognized that, owing to the actual presence of Soviet power and the
                            apparatus of Soviet control, all these means, with the exception of the
                            military, are of limited effectiveness.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Political and Diplomatic</hi></p>
                        <p>21. The major political and diplomatic capability is to exert upon the
                            existing Soviet-controlled regimes the pressure of the long-standing
                            U.S. position defending the fundamental right of the satellite peoples
                            to freedom. The United States can reaffirm its position on this subject
                            on all appropriate occasions in discussions both with its free world
                            partners and with Soviet and satellite representatives, with a view to
                            strengthening and broadening pressure on the USSR and the satellite
                            regimes.</p>
                        <p>22. The United States maintains diplomatic missions in Poland,
                            Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Rumania. This is advantageous in that it (a)
                            provides useful opportunities for reporting and intelligence
                            acquisition, <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0237"/>(b) shows American

                            satellite peoples, (c) makes possible direct contact with the government
                            concerned and treatment of such problems as the protection of American
                            citizens and property, (d) provides a vantage point which could be
                            useful in the event of future developments which might be exploited in
                            the U.S. interest, and (e) provides a means for evaluating and guiding
                            our propaganda effort. The principal disadvantages are (a) the
                            impression created in some quarters that diplomatic relations indicate
                            the acceptance of the legitimacy of the Communist regimes, (b) the
                            pressures and harassments to which American representatives in the
                            satellite states are subjected, to the detriment of U.S. prestige, and
                            (c) the security problems created by the presence of satellite missions
                            in the United States. Diplomatic relations with Bulgaria and Albania
                            should be resumed whenever those governments give satisfactory
                            guarantees for the treatment of our missions and their personnel and
                            exhibit a willingness to negotiate satisfactory settlements of

                                feels that this is an issue which should be carefully reviewed by
                                    <gloss target="#t_EDAC1">EDAC</gloss> and ACEP before broad

                                [Footnote in the source text.]</note> 23. Western controls of
                            exports to the Soviet bloc, as well as the Soviet bloc drive for
                            self-sufficiency, reduced the trade of Eastern Europe with the free
                            world to a low level by 1953. Subsequently, the Eastern European
                            countries have begun to show more interest in increasing imports from
                            the free world, including the United States, and have taken steps to
                            expand their exports to those areas, with a result that their trade with
                            the West has increased substantially, though it continues to be small as
                            compared to trade within the Bloc. The relatively low level of East-West
                            trade and the size and strength of the Soviet bloc economy, together
                            with Soviet autarchic policies, serve to limit the efficacy of economic
                            pressures as implements to accomplish the general purposes of this
                            paper. They might, however, have some harassment value or could serve as
                            auxiliaries to a coordinated program based primarily on other measures.
                            Existing trade controls have already made the economic problems of the
                            satellites more difficult and to this extent contribute to realizing the
                            specific purposes of U.S. policy toward the satellites. On the other
                            hand, the application of controls on a general basis going beyond
                            commodities of a primary <pb n="208" xml:id="pg_208" facs="0238"

                            cooperation among the free world countries, and the question accordingly
                            arises whether they are worthwhile in terms of the general aspects of
                            U.S. relations with the USSR and with our free world allies. Such
                            general controls may also be self-defeating in so far as they tend to
                            facilitate the integration of the satellites with the USSR. The
                            unilateral application of economic pressures by the United States should
                            therefore be considered on a case-by-case basis, bearing in mind the
                            balance of advantage in each instance between the USSR and the free

                                broader authority from Congress which would permit either local
                                currency sales of agricultural surpluses to the satellites or the
                                granting of most-favored-nation treatment to the satellites under
                                the Tariff laws. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> 24. The
                            existing low level of trade makes relatively more important economic
                            incentives as a measure to promote U.S. policy toward the satellites.
                            The ability of the United States to offer such incentives, however, is
                            presently inhibited by legislative obstacles to trade with the Soviet
                            bloc. Legislative restrictions on trade in U.S. Government-owned
                            foodstuffs and the provisions of the Trade Agreements Act, which deny to
                            Soviet bloc countries the benefits of most-favored-nation treatment, are
                            presently applied to the bloc as a whole. They do not permit individual
                            treatment as circumstances may warrant. It is desirable to attain
                            greater flexibility in U.S. economic policies, in order that maximum
                            advantage may be gained with the limited economic weapons at hand (both
                            restrictions and incentives). Favorable Congressional action should be
                            sought on amendatory legislation where necessary to provide the
                            flexibility required to utilize increased trade as an incentive to
                            promote the objectives of U.S. policy toward the satellites.</p>

                        <p>25. The denial to the satellite peoples of access to truth and means of
                            contact with the outside world has limited the possibilities in the
                            propaganda field principally to broadcasting, although balloons, air
                            drops, etc., are being used to supplement this medium. The operation of
                            adequate technical facilities for broadcasting to the satellites and
                            effective programming assume increasing importance in view of the need
                            to conserve and promote anti-Communist sentiment in the face of the
                            Communist monopoly over the various media of information. Utilization of
                            our propaganda facilities is conditioned by the necessity of avoiding,
                            on the one hand, any commitments regarding the time <pb n="209"
                                xml:id="pg_209" facs="0239"/>and means of achieving freedom from
                            Soviet domination and any incitement to premature revolt, and, on the
                            other hand, seeking to maintain faith in the eventual restoration of
                            freedom.</p>
                        <p>26. One important means of sustaining the hope and faith of the satellite
                            peoples in eventual freedom and independence would be a program of
                            reciprocal exchanges, especially on the non-official level. The travel
                            of Americans in the satellites and reciprocal visits to the United
                            States can become an effective means of serving to remind the captive
                            peoples of U.S. interest in their ultimate freedom, and correcting the
                            distorted image of the West as mirrored in Communist propaganda
                            media.</p>

                        <p>The Sec. returned the call. L. said he is beginning to think we should do
                            something about the Posnan riot. He is thinking primarily about the
                            effect on Polish-Americans. L. mentioned a possibility was setting up a
                            Peace Observation Commission because Poland has international status. Or
                            go at it as we did re bacteriological charges<note n="2" xml:id="d77fn2"

                            instigated the riots. L. has been talking with the Polish Govt. in Exile
                            and they are prepared for a Soviet veto but they seem to think something
                            like this with a good preamble would be encouraging there. From what L.
                            gets from Polish-Americans and Congress they would like it. They want a
                            resolution in the SC which would be ultimately vetoed and which would
                            have a preamble setting forth the facts of the situation in Poland today
                            and which would call for a Peace Observation Commission in Poland. The
                            Sec. said he is not negative on it but has been trying to think of some
                            way usefully to bring it up and which won’t backfire. He will probably
                            be questioned tomorrow and wonders what position to take. We don’t <pb
                                n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0240"/>want to be too negative in
                            denying we had anything to do with it because while it is true we never
                            instigated anything at all and no money has been spent, nevertheless we
                            do try to keep alive the spirit of liberty in these people. The
                            President has stated they should have independence. If as a result of
                            that, people have aspirations for better things, we don’t want to wholly
                            deny a part. L. said another approach is that [Rokossovskiy?]<note n="3"

                            is a Russian general and Soviet troops are there and interfere with
                            Poland which is a member of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The
                            Sec. said something like that strikes him as being more important than
                            just to challenge an investigation on the ground we had nothing to do
                            with it. From a purely political standpoint it is not too bad to let
                            some think we did. L. said the approach on the Russian end is better. L.
                            has talked with <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName> about it
                            and he has all L. has and has a lot of stuff the Dept has L. hasn’t got.
                            The purpose of his calling is as an American politician and his <gloss

                                <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> said it was an
                            internal affair. They agreed it is not simple and there could be a lot
                            of dividends if it is played right. The Sec. said he has been thinking
                            about it and referred to the Dept statement.<note n="4" xml:id="d77fn4"

                            not believe we would get support from the British and French if we went
                            in on the ground there is interference by the Soviet Union in the
                            internal affairs of Poland. The Sec. said the British and French are
                            weak when things are breaking our way. The Sec. shares L.’s feeling. He
                            questioned if he could get any of these Poles in this country maybe to
                            present a petition or something of that sort. Both have heard from
                            Congressmen. The Sec. said a petition to the SC. L. said the HR passed a

                            action to bring them into conformity with the present situation in
                            Eastern Europe and with a more realistic assessment of US capabilities
                            to effect developments in that area.</p>
                        <p>The only bracketed language occurs in paragraph 25, on page 11, where the
                            Treasury Department proposes restrictions with respect to the
                            recommendation to ask authority for greater flexibility in US economic
                            policy towards the satellites. <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss> would
                            prefer to have the bracketed section dropped in order to assure that the
                            general courses of action not enter into unnecessary detail, but has no
                            substantive objection to the proposal since it is not contemplated that
                            authority would be sought to take the specific steps which Treasury
                            desires to guard against.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> briefed the Council on
                            the main features of the proposed new policy,<note n="7" xml:id="d79fn7"

                            particularly as it differed from the existing policy on the subject,
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 174. When he reached paragraph
                            25, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> pointed out the
                            split views. As proposed by the majority of the Planning Board, the
                            paragraph would read:</p>
                        <gap/>
                        <p>The Treasury member of the Planning Board wished to delete the first four
                            words. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> suggested that
                            this might be a suitable time for the Council to determine which version
                            it preferred, and invited Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1"
                                >Humphrey</persName> to speak to the Treasury position.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that the
                            position of the Treasury Department was quite a simple one. It seemed to
                            them that, with all the difficulties which the Administration was now
                            encountering with the Congress, it was wholly unrealistic to go to the
                            Congress and ask them <pb n="213" xml:id="pg_213" facs="0243"/>to agree
                            to legislation which would permit us to give surplus agricultural
                            commodities to the Soviet satellites. It was simply impossible,
                            according to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>,
                            to get any such concession from Congress. They were opposed to any
                            liberalization of Public Law 480 vis-à-vis the Soviet satellites. To
                            make the attempt to induce a liberalization would only succeed in
                            arousing a storm of protest in Congress and further complicate our
                            already involved situation.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> inquired whether the
                            Secretary of State and the Secretary of Agriculture had not already
                            requested authority from Congress for greater flexibility in carrying
                            out economic policies toward the satellites. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that all that they had
                            sought was authority to barter goods with countries behind the Iron
                            Curtain. Moreover, he added, he had not in mind asking anything more of
                            the Congress by way of authority in this area.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that he went
                            along with the position taken by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1"
                                >Humphrey</persName> toward this course of action, but that he did
                            so for different reasons than Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1"
                                >Humphrey</persName>. He was not opposed to seeking additional
                            authority from Congress simply because to do so was inexpedient at this
                            time, but rather because he did not wish to see the standard of living
                            in the satellites raised through the agency of U.S. surplus food. If the
                            satellite standard of living was raised, it would indirectly promote
                            both the political stability and the military power of the satellite
                            states. In sum, trading on a preferred basis with the Communists in
                            items of food value was a very doubtful course of action. It would be
                            doubtful even if the people of the United States and the Congress could
                            be induced to support it.</p>
                        <p>. . . In concluding, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> once again repeated that he was not now seeking
                            any new authority, along the lines suggested by paragraph 25, from the
                            Congress at this time.</p>
                        <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214" facs="0244"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> pointed out that it
                            was generally understood that an effort would be made to secure
                            Congressional agreement for the sale of surplus commodities in return
                            for local currencies. This, he believed, underlay paragraph 25.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that in
                            general when this Government sold surplus agricultural commodities to
                            foreign countries, it gave back the local currencies thus generated to
                            the country which received the surplus food. This being the general
                            pattern of our performance, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1"
                                >Humphrey</persName> predicted that we would get into terrible
                            trouble if we followed this pattern of operations in dealing with the
                            satellites.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President agreed that from the practical standpoint the language
                            of paragraph 25, calling for additional authority and greater
                            flexibility in U.S. economic policies toward the satellites from the
                            Congress, posed a political impossibility at this time. Later on we may
                            educate Congress into understanding more clearly our reasons for seeking
                            such additional flexibility. Accordingly, the Vice President said he
                            agreed with the Treasury proposal to delete the first four words of the
                            paragraph.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> again stated
                            emphatically that he hadn’t the slightest idea of going before Congress
                            for anything at the present time; and if any such proposal as this was
                            inherent in paragraph 25, it was nothing less than ridiculous,
                            particularly with the Congress about to adjourn. Was anybody, he asked,
                            actually suggesting that the Administration should now go to Congress
                            for more authority . . . ? Accordingly, he said, he was quite prepared
                            to agree to drop the bracketed four words. Subsequently, if the
                            situation warranted, we could seek authority for more flexible action
                            from the Congress.</p>

                                    death of Stalin—particularly the introduction of collective
                                    leadership, Moscow’s acceptance of Titoism and acknowledgment
                                    that there are “different roads to Socialism”, and the
                                    denigration of Stalin—are being reflected in current satellite
                                    developments. These developments have varied in pace and scope
                                    in each of the satellites and are continuing, but common to them
                                    all are a reduction in the role of the secret police embodied in
                                    the emphasis on the need for “socialist legality” and the
                                    admission of past errors attributed to the “cult of
                                    personality”. Some personnel changes have occurred at the top in

                                    indications that Moscow now recognizes the advantage of using
                                    greater flexibility as well as more camouflage in its control of
                                    the satellites, and of giving them certain latitude or
                                    responsibility of decision on matters of local detail within the

                                    movement itself, remains a disruptive force in Soviet-satellite
                                    relations. There is a real and growing split in most satellite
                                    parties between those amenable to close Soviet control and the
                                    “national Communists”. However, since the combination of basic
                                    factors which made possible the successful Yugoslav break with
                                    Moscow is lacking in the satellites, it is unlikely that the
                                    Yugoslav experience will be repeated in any of them. Moreover,
                                    by its reconciliation with Tito, Moscow has sought with some
                                    success to neutralize the competing attraction originally
                                    exercised on the satellite governments by Belgrade’s independent
                                    position and policies.</item>

                                    provides a standing example of successful defiance of the
                                    Kremlin and a demonstration that the West is prepared to assist
                                    nationalistic Communist leaders to assert their independence of
                                    Moscow. Despite Moscow’s apparent reconciliation with Belgrade,
                                    it may be still possible to exploit Yugoslavia’s unique position
                                    in promoting future changes in the Soviet satellite
                                    relationship. Any diminution of Yugoslavia’s independence of the
                                    Kremlin will limit its usefulness in this regard. On the other
                                    hand, a Yugoslavia which maintains a position of independence
                                    between East and West would be an important asset in promoting
                                    possible future changes in the Soviet-satellite

                                    and subsequently, arises in part from their German policy and in

                                    incentives for postponing an agreement on German reunification.

                                    difficult problem of control for the USSR than do the other
                                    satellites. While the Eastern German regime has made some
                                    progress with the program of basic industrial development and
                                    socialization, and while there are various factors operating to
                                    weaken resistance of the Eastern German population to the
                                    Communist regime, there is little likelihood that the East
                                    Germans can be brought to accept the Communist system imposed on
                                    them. The fact that the main body of the German nation in the
                                    Federal Republic has made considerable advances in freedom and
                                    well-being, and the fact that West Berlin provides a means of
                                    contact with the Free World, serve to keep alive in Eastern
                                    Germany the hope for an escape from Soviet domination. The

                                    the rest of the Soviet satellites, and to make difficult full
                                    utilization by the Soviet Union of East Germany’s economic

                        <p>Reactions other Western Legations (only limited number contacted thus far
                            but these well-informed) show generally two schools of thought which
                            differ mainly in emphasis:</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>(1)</label>
                            <item>[One] School considers Soviet role as that of brake in preventing
                                situation from going much further. Action taken estimated by Soviets
                                as minimum concession to stave off further party revolt, and one
                                which would at same time permit restoration order. According this
                                reasoning Poznan (and possibly even Petofi Club) riot strengthened
                                Rakosi’s hand and perhaps resulted in smaller concession being
                                worked out than might otherwise eventually have come about. Future
                                situation probably to be highlighted by renewed party revolts within
                                reasonably short period of time since present solution satisfies no
                                one. Regime now setting about to forestall these revolts extent
                                possible. Future concessions will be determined by relative strength
                                these actions as well as by international situation.</item>
                            <label>(2)</label>
                            <item>Another school views situation as evolutionary, not revolutionary;
                                despite minuteness of concession, nevertheless Rakosi is gone and
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> is installed. Gero’s
                                health poor, his role may not be paramount for long. Some
                                concessions have been granted to non-Stalinist party faction and to
                                general public. There will probably be room within framework of new
                                regime’s controls for more freedom of expression within party. If
                                flare-ups do not come too quickly or too sharply, then in course of
                                time gradual liberalization is probable.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>In Legation view based on analysis possible thus far, situation suggests
                            that conflicting forces engendered by recent developments i.e., trend
                            toward surface liberality sparked by 20th Soviet Party Congress on one
                            hand, and reaction influenced by such open criticism of local party as
                            voiced in Petofi Club, and by Poznan riots, on other, have resulted in
                            curious and perhaps unstable compromise, i.e.:</p>
                        <p>Number 1 Stalinist Rakosi out as First Secretary Party—but Gero with
                            hardly more savory record in; new blood in Politburo includes such
                            relatively non-doctrinaire elements as <persName corresp="#p_KJ1"
                                >Kadar</persName> and Marosan—but old gang with exception Rakosi
                            still there; some lip service paid to Socialist legality and free
                            criticism, slightly smaller industry investments and abolition peace
                            loan, as well as softer words for erstwhile <pb n="226" xml:id="pg_226"
                                facs="0256"/>“kulaks”—but need for party solidarity behind central
                            leadership, danger from “enemy” abroad and at home (latter including
                                <persName>Imre Nagy</persName> and right deviationists)
                            stressed.</p>
                        <p>In any event, evident that those at controls felt something should
                            finally be done, after continuing postponements of meeting to aid
                            letting off steam of current discontent. But whether such solution can
                            satisfy any group for long seems most doubtful.</p>
                        <p>While too soon yet to reach definitive conclusion, we tend toward belief
                            that Soviet pressure was exercised in favor of minimum concession
                            possible at time, and that fact changes made in spite of previous Soviet
                            support of Rakosi, evident up to <persName corresp="#p_MAI1"
                                >Mikoyan</persName>’s arrival, show deep and broad nature opposition
                            to Rakosi as personification of old system. We doubt that opposition
                            will be satisfied with this crumb for very long and believe that any
                            efforts to reinstitute tighter controls might in fact work to speed new
                            outburst. While much depends of course upon <persName corresp="#p_KJ1"
                                >Kadar</persName>’s role in future, we are not inclined to think at
                            moment that his role is intended to be paramount nor that it is now
                            intended that he use new position as stepping stone to become Gero’s
                            successor. On whole Legation inclined to foresee some period of uneasy
                            equilibrium followed later by clearer trend direction of which depends
                            on results achieved by present Hungarian leadership at home and of
                            current Soviet policies on international plane.</p>
                        <p>Suggestions for media treatment follow:</p>
                        <p>Insofar possible judge up to now, reaction Hungarian people to Rakosi’s
                            departure seems to be one of relief, tempered however by usual
                            skepticism, fundamental lack of public interest in Communist party
                            maneuverings and disappointment over Gero as successor. This change in
                            leaders, viewed against background post-20th Congress atmosphere,
                            probably considered by part Hungarian people as small landmark on road

                                    and the American reaction. Both Poles felt that the Polish
                                    Government might be restrained from repression against Poznan
                                    rioters by expressions of “Free World interest.” They suggested
                                    a U.S. protest to Warsaw, and possibly Moscow, demanding
                                    international supervision of the trials of the Poznan
                                    demonstrators, and a corresponding protest to the United
                                    Nations. The émigrés offered to send food, which had been
                                    rejected by the Polish Government when officially proffered from
                                    Washington, to Poland through their own channels. Finally, they
                                    asked for help in publication of letters on Poznań to the
                                    editors of major newspapers. <persName corresp="#p_BJD1"

                        <p>Mr. Mikolajczyk and Mr. Popiel called this afternoon at their request to
                            discuss the recent Poznan riots and to suggest United States action in
                            that connection.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Mikolajczyk opened the conversation by stating that he did not agree
                            with the argument that Free World activity and comment regarding Poznan
                            would spur the Polish Government to more repressive measures. He said
                            that on the contrary the Warsaw regime would be more likely to follow a
                            policy of moderation if it felt the world was interested and watching.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> expressed his
                            agreement with this point of view and said that while he did not feel it
                            was desirable for us to exhort the Polish people to rise up we should
                            not try to restrain or discourage them. He added that, with the
                            exception of the Free Poles, he felt that it was inappropriate for the
                            Free World to try to tell the Polish people what they should or should
                            not do, and that advice of that sort was likely to arouse resentment
                            among them. Mr. Mikolajczyk agreed and briefly criticized a Polish
                            language leaflet which the Russian émigré NTS organization had sent into
                            Poland and which appeared to speak for the Free Poles although it had no
                            right to do so.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Mikolajczyk then referred to the main purpose of his visit—to urge
                            American action in connection with Poznan. He put forward two specific
                            suggestions: <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0259"/>
                            <list>

                        <p>Mr. Mikolajczyk said that he felt the second step should be taken
                            regardless of whether the first measure is approved by the Security
                            Council. He also discussed the urgent need for such action so that the
                            Polish people as well as the Warsaw regime would not think that the
                            Poznan uprising was disregarded in the West. He felt that the action he
                            proposed would have a very desirable effect in Eastern Europe.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> thanked the Polish
                            visitors for their visit and indicated the abovementioned suggestions
                            would be taken into consideration.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Mikolajczyk left two reports (see attached) of statements by the
                            International Peasant Union and the Polish National Democratic Committee

                                    him came primarily from within the Hungarian Communist Party;
                                    (2) Yugoslav influence alone was not enough to bring on his
                                    removal although it helped “to create and maintain Party
                                    factionalism”; (3) the Soviet role was that of “controlling and
                                    guiding factors which were already in play”; and (4) opposition
                                    to Rákosi was ideological as much as personal. (<hi

                            began with the resignation of Rakosi, a number of characteristics of

                        <p>An examination of these characteristics leads toward the conclusion that
                            events have moved faster and more favorably than most observers
                            anticipated. While it is true that many steps which have been taken must
                            be labelled as concessions made desirable because of the strength of the
                            opposition and designed to head it off; and while it is also true that
                            the basic conflict continues between those wishing to cushion the effect
                            of the 20th Congress in Hungary and those willing or wishing to permit a
                            more natural development of ideological thought and political practice
                            (within limits); nevertheless the arena of political conflict, and
                            perhaps of economic, appears to be further to the right than six weeks
                            ago, and in many cases further to the right than under Nagy during
                            1953–54. There is reason to believe it will move still further in this
                            direction in the next few months.</p>
                        <p>What was possibly the first overt Soviet intrusion into the domestic
                            scene since Rakosi’s resignation took place recently; whether or not
                            this interpretation is the correct one, there is little doubt that such
                            an intrusion will occur if developments in Hungary move too fast.
                            Whether it could now be resisted more successfully than in the past, and
                            the effect of Soviet intervention on Hungarian political developments,
                            are very important questions for the future.</p>
                        <p>The reference despatch reviewed certain of the events which preceded and
                            led up to the removal of Rakosi from his pre-eminent position in this
                            country. His removal, although properly referred to as the ending of the
                            Stalinist era, may also be called the beginning of a new era in Hungary
                            which so far cannot be adequately designated. <pb n="233"
                                xml:id="pg_233" facs="0263"/>While it is true that many events and
                            developments which have become evident since Rakosi’s demission had
                            their origin long before July 18, the changes that have occurred
                            recently and are still continuing have already resulted, as the
                            Hungarian regime has been the first and loudest to claim, in a
                            noticeably different atmosphere here.</p>
                        <p>Although it is still far too soon after Rakosi’s dismissal to describe,
                            and particularly to evaluate accurately, the era now beginning, it is
                            not too early to set down certain of its highlights and characteristics
                            as they have become evident since July 18. The following appear worthy
                            of note: <list>

                                <item><p>There has been no personality cult built up around Gero.
                                        While his name has appeared regularly in the press since the
                                        end of Parliament, he has made no public speeches (despite
                                        many opportunities) and has been referred to only casually
                                        (although favorably) by other speakers. His principal public
                                        statement was made in a <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi>
                                        article dated August 26, reprinted in <hi rend="italic"
                                            >Szabad Nep</hi> on August 28. This <hi rend="italic"
                                            >Pravda</hi> support is of course significant in itself
                                        but would in our opinion be much more so were Gero playing a
                                        more active role in public life and were there more marked
                                        differences in viewpoint between Gero and others.</p>
                                    <p>Rumors about Gero’s health have been conflicting: It is known
                                        that some time ago he was in poor health (ulcers), yet in
                                        Parliament July 30 he appeared brown and healthy, and he
                                        gave that same impression to <hi rend="italic">New York
                                            Times</hi> correspondent John MacCormac on August 14. A
                                        later unconfirmed report was received, however, to the
                                        effect that his general health is still very poor; and in
                                        fact that he uses facial make-up in order to conceal his
                                        pallor and poor appearance.</p></item>

                                            >Kadar</persName> seems to be considerable. This
                                        judgment is admittedly based largely on his speech at
                                        Salgotarjan on August 12, which was reported in detailed
                                        summary in <hi rend="italic">Szabad Nep</hi> and almost
                                        completely in the Nograd County paper. The Legation
                                        considers it certainly interesting and probably significant
                                        that <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> was the
                                        first and is still the only top figure except Gero to devote
                                        himself primarily to internal political matters, or at least
                                        the only top figure prominently covered in <hi rend="italic"
                                            >Szabad Nep</hi> as so doing. Exceptions to this might
                                        be Marton Horvath in his editorial of August 12, and
                                        Marosan’s article of August 19, but both of the latter
                                        statements were obviously directed toward <pb n="234"

                                            >Szabad Nep</hi> summary, was that it was rather
                                        moderate in tone. We were also impressed by <persName
                                            corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName>’s reversal of the
                                        usual order of Rakosi’s shortcomings, and by his implication
                                        that the errors of rightist deviation were due in part to
                                        the earlier errors of the Stalinist period, i.e., blaming
                                        Rakosi for anything Nagy may have done. Based on the full
                                        version of the speech, the moderateness of <persName
                                            corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName>’s tone is not nearly
                                        so obvious. In fact the main difference between <persName
                                            corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> and Gero’s speech of
                                        July 18 to the Central Leadership appears to the Legation to
                                        be the difference in approach to the People’s Political
                                        Front (see Paragraph 3d below).</p>

                                        gaining broader non-Party but still political (as opposed to
                                        popular) support. This policy, it was thought, stemmed
                                        basically from the increasing realization within the Party
                                        that its political support (that is, its support among
                                        “political” circles) as well as its popular support, is so
                                        small. <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> seemed to
                                        be saying that the Party has shut itself off from the rest
                                        of the country when he said “You must not be afraid of
                                        listening to the opinions expressed by non-Party workers in

                                        seemed to mean that the basic purpose of this admonition is
                                        to “consolidate unity” between the Party and other groups,
                                        and he pleaded with both Party members and working masses to
                                        have confidence in the Central Leadership. He went on to say
                                        that “of course no one can work miracles and neither can the

                                        Inter alia, a number of developments are evident: The sharp
                                        criticism of the Petofi Club excesses have died out; Marton
                                        Horvath in an important article on August 12 implied that
                                        the leaders of the opposition were not really to blame,
                                        which seems to indicate that they may be readmitted to the
                                        Party—as in fact rumor already has them; the regime appears
                                        to be moving to liberalize its treatment of intellectuals’
                                        children (although its discrimination against such children
                                        did not apply to leading Party intellectuals); and literary
                                        magazines are already beginning to speak out about the
                                        special privileges enjoyed by the top Party hierarchy.</p>
                                    <p>The changes in this field were formalized in a recent Central
                                        Committee resolution which was probably designed to
                                        anticipate future demands from the intellectual groups, as
                                        well as to define the limitations within which intellectual
                                        freedom will be free to move. The most revealing reaction to
                                        this resolution was an article by pro-Nagyist Geza Losonczy
                                        in <hi rend="italic">Muvelt Nep</hi> of Sept. 2. Losonczy
                                        welcomed the words of the resolution, at least as a partial
                                        statement of the requirements of the intelligentsia, but
                                        pointed out that their fulfillment could be realized only by
                                        means of struggle. Losonczy referred to the June 30
                                        resolution of the Central Leadership, which cracked down on
                                        the Petofi Club, as an example of the kind of mistrust with
                                        which the intellectuals have had to contend down to the
                                        present. The article seemed to augur that the regime could
                                        hope to win the fight for the mind of the intellectual only
                                        by vying with a vocal rightist element.</p></item>

                                        listed and described five measures taken by the Hungarian
                                        Government to remove obstacles to discussion of
                                        Hungarian-U.S. problems. The measures were the release from
                                        prison of two ex-employees of the Legation, the release of
                                        U.S. correspondents, reduction in the “tailing” of Legation
                                        personnel, cooperation with the Legation in some
                                        administrative matters, and elimination of travel

                                    conclusive judgment in this regard, a number of steps have been
                                    taken recently which appear to indicate that a slow improvement
                                    in relations with the United States is desired by the Hungarian
                                    Government.</item>

                        <p>An observer’s interpretation of the above developments will of course
                            depend on a number of factors, including whether the developments turn
                            out to be real ones, the reaction of the Hungarian population, and the
                            extent to which the observer himself, or in this case the <pb n="240"
                                xml:id="pg_240" facs="0270"/>American Legation, is also being wooed.
                            The Legation’s reaction has been to interpret the recent changes,
                            including Rakosi’s ouster, as conciliatory steps made desirable by the
                            strength of the opposition to the Stalinist faction, first represented
                            by Rakosi and now by Gero, and concurred in by the Soviets. The steps
                            have been interpreted as designed to head off this opposition and to
                            permit the present regime to bridle the opposing forces, who have become
                            more unruly due to the Twentieth Congress, for as long as possible.
                            Further concessions will be made as and if they become necessary in the
                            eyes of the regime; or on the other hand, some already placed before the
                            altar of the public may be withdrawn when the regime has attained
                            sufficient strength. The basic forces here might be described as: 1) the
                            relatively pro-Soviet forces which are anxious to cushion the shock of
                            the Twentieth Congress within Hungary; and 2) the more liberal groups
                            which are attempting, at least for the moment, to permit a natural
                            development of political and intellectual endeavor, albeit within
                            certain limits. These more liberal groups of course include a wide
                            range, united in the past primarily in their opposition to the
                            “doctrinaires”. Both groups are also motivated by the necessity of
                            bringing about economic improvement within the country, although they
                            would follow different roads towards this goal.</p>
                        <p>It may not be correct, however, to polarize the two groups so clearly
                            into opposing forces; or rather, it may not be correct to characterize
                            them today as the old pro-Rakosi-ites on the one hand and everyone else
                            on the other. This period is one of flux, when because of the
                            ideological effect of the Twentieth Congress and because of the personal
                            effect of the removal of Rakosi, new ideological and personal
                            relationships, and new limits to the freedom within which individuals
                            and groups can act, are being worked out. Although these limitations
                            still remain, present “policy” (while ostensibly under the control of
                            Gero) is considerably more liberal—or promises to be—in many respects
                            (religious instruction, control of secret police, freedom of discussion,
                            Parliamentary behavior) than previously under Nagy. Presumably, Nagy has
                            in the meantime moved somewhat further to the right. Therefore the
                            eventual resting point of Hungarian policy cannot yet be foreseen,
                            because the liberalizing factors which have been set in motion are still
                            at work and will be for some time to come.</p>
                        <pb n="241" xml:id="pg_241" facs="0271"/>
                        <p>At this time, the reporting officer believes that there are strong
                            liberalizing forces in Hungary which are now freer to operate than in
                            the past, and that the full effect of their activity has not yet come
                            about. At the same time, restraining forces continue to be voiced and
                            felt, as they will in the future. And on the whole the present political
                            line, or arena of conflict, dividing these two forces, and perhaps also
                            the economic line, is to the right of its position before July 18.</p>
                        <p>It is to be expected that the “line” would change less rapidly in the
                            case of foreign affairs than in the case of internal, as has been the
                            case. To adopt a very different foreign policy line would mean a clear
                            break with the Soviet Union, which even a much more liberal internal
                            policy would not, at least to the same extent, imply. Furthermore,
                            foreign policy is more a matter of propaganda in many fields than a
                            matter of day-by-day existence, and there is consequently not so much
                            pressure for an immediate change. In addition, as already pointed out,
                            there is some evidence that foreign policy is changing, although very
                            slowly and not yet very significantly.</p>
                        <p>Events in Hungary have moved faster and farther since the removal of
                            Rakosi than was anticipated by many at the time. While much that has
                            reportedly taken place has not yet been fully confirmed, and while many
                            promises have not yet been fulfilled, there is without doubt a new
                            atmosphere in the country. The main question at the moment is not so
                            much “What is present policy?” as it is “What will happen in the next
                            six months?” There has so far been little evidence of the Soviet brake
                            being reapplied (although the Gero article in <hi rend="italic"
                                >Pravda</hi> may possibly be the first), but if developments move
                            too fast there is no doubt that an effort will be made to use this
                            brake. Whether, as in July, Soviet influence will be considerable, or
                            whether the Hungarians can emulate what their Polish brethren are
                            apparently doing and reduce Soviet influence remains to be seen.</p>

                        <p>According to reports from the Yugoslav Government and other sources, the
                            Soviet Union sent a circular on September 3 to its Eastern European
                            satellites denying Marshal Tito’s status as a bona fide Communist,
                            warning the satellites not to follow the Yugoslav example too closely,
                            and attacking Yugoslav foreign policy as pro-Western. No official
                            statement of this warning was released by the Soviet Union or the
                            satellites. (<hi rend="italic">Soviet Affairs</hi>, October 1956, page

                        <p>Seemingly as a consequence of the deterioration of Soviet-Yugoslav

                                >Khrushchev</persName> suddenly went to Yugoslavia on September 17
                            for an 8-day stay which included discussions with Tito. The <persName

                            described as “of a private nature for the purpose of rest,” although
                            some U.S. officials believed there was much more to the trip, as
                            evidenced by the following extract from the briefing on “Significant
                            World Developments Affecting U.S. Security,” by Acting Director of

                                    There were various speculations on the reasons for this visit.
                                    It was thought, for example, that the Soviet leaders were
                                    considerably worried about the rate at which some of the Soviet
                                    satellites, notably Poland, were proceeding along the course
                                    which would lead to national communism. They were inclined to
                                    blame Tito for the rapidity of these developments and <persName
                                        corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> may have gone to
                                    Yugoslavia to warn Tito about the dangers inherent in this
                                    course. Tito in turn may use the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                        >Khrushchev</persName> visit in an effort to get commitments
                                    from the Soviet leaders on the timing and speed of the movement
                                    toward greater independence for the Soviet satellites.”

                                    >Khrushchev</persName>’s opponents are arguing that Tito’s

                        <p>There was no such “pledge”. It was stated at one point that it would be
                            made clear “that United States policy, as one of its peaceful purposes,
                            looks happily forward to the genuine independence of those captive
                            peoples”. And at another point it was said, “The policies we espouse
                            will revive the contagious, liberating influences which are inherent in
                            freedom. They will inevitably set up strains and stresses within the
                            captive world which will make the rulers impotent to continue in their
                            monstrous ways and mark the beginning of the end”.</p>
                        <p>Certainly you and I have consistently made it clear, and you notably at
                            the Geneva Summit Conference, that we seek the genuine independence of
                            the captive peoples. Also I believe this Administration, <pb n="244"

                            done much to revive the influences which are inherent in freedom, that
                            we have thereby contributed toward creating strains and stresses within
                            the captive world, such as were manifested by the East German outbreaks
                            of June 1953 and the Poznan outbreaks of this year. Also of course there
                            are the very major adjustments going on within the Soviet Union to
                            adjust domestic policies to take greater account of the aspirations of
                            the people.</p>

                                during the last 2 years, and that Poland was pursuing a more
                                independent policy and had taken advantage of the relaxation of
                                Soviet domination to go their own independent way. The British
                                Ambassador recommended that the West take advantage of this trend.
                                The U.S. Embassy disagreed and stated that the changes in Poland
                                were only surface; it promised its own view of the situation.

                        <p>These developments not always what they appeared at first glance. In
                            important respects, word was far ahead of deed and, in other cases,
                            unstated but real limitations robbed above factors of most their
                            apparent value. For example, economic distress of masses understandably

                            millenium probably appeared far away as ever to Polish worker.
                            Similarly, “rehabilitation” some former leaders and <gloss

                        <p>Further, “socialist legality” and related developments such as increased

                            personal satisfaction masses (which, regime hoped, would be reflected in
                            increased productivity) regime probably wishes, within confines
                            Communist doctrine, liberalize life much as possible in hopes greater
                            returns for regime. Significant criticism by press now rare, legislative

                            liberalization program to officials.</p>
                        <p>Above connection, often rumored since Poznan that regime split on how
                            handle liberalization and other matters. While this not confirmed,
                            “private” statements high representatives regime (e.g. Ambassador
                            Gajewski Paris) plugging line somewhat different from official one, plus
                            traditional nationalism Poles, raises possibility regime less monolithic
                            than historic Communist would desire. These statements could, of course,
                            be inspired plants but Embassy inclined believe regime leaders not in
                            agreement among selves on liberalization and other important issues.
                            Some observers even speculate Polish overtures to India and Yugoslavia,
                            though made in keeping with Moscow’s policies, may have been willingly
                            entered into in hope those countries might eventually support Poland if
                            conditions ever made it possible for Poland enter upon independent
                            course. In any event, mental confusion and frustration Communist minds
                            following denigration Stalin likely not yet resolved and must contribute
                            substantially to indecision this and other problems.</p>
                        <p>Embassy has impression western journalists and western groups various
                            kinds have begun take somewhat more realistic view developments Poland
                            although some still see only outward appearances of liberalization and
                            some even profess believe Poland has begun assert independence from USSR
                            (e.g. Coblenz article in <hi rend="italic">Herald Tribune</hi> Paris

                        <p>While Embassy feels no evidence liberalization has developed into
                            anything like “irreversible trend”, it is still too early assess extent
                            recession is in process. Several months ago, when liberalization was new
                            thing, all experiencing it closely probably felt considerable excitement
                            at possibility this was beginning real evolution toward democracy in
                            accepted sense word. With liberalization now in somewhat static state
                            and first flush hope fading a little, Poles and observers alike may find
                            difficulty evaluate potentialities properly. Some Embassy Polish sources
                            seem depressed re prospects significant improvement saying life hard as
                            ever and de-Stalinization merely reshuffling old pack cards. Others,
                            chiefly semi-official contacts in fields science, agriculture,

                        <p>Such relaxation and change as there has been and will be in foreseeable

                        <p>Polish Communist authorities have announced that the trials of some of
                            the persons arrested in connection with the Poznan riots of last June

                        <p>I believe that Free World concern and interest can exert some restraining
                            influence over the Warsaw regime’s policy in this instance. An
                            appropriate statement by you early this week could not only serve this
                            purpose but would also provide the Polish people with timely evidence
                            that they have not been forgotten and that the importance and
                            significance of the Poznan riots have not been overlooked.</p>

                        <p>The subject conversation lasted for about an hour and covered a number of
                            topics, primarily general. It opened with a remark on the recent Crimea

                            Party members rather than dictated from the top. He added that he did
                            not think that public opinion, in terms of that held by the broad masses
                            of the population, yet plays a very important role in this country; but
                            he felt that majority opinion within the Party has recently come to
                            exert an influence which is being felt.</p>

                        <p>He went on to say that, in his opinion, <persName>Imre Nagy</persName>
                            has for practical purposes already been rehabilitated through adoption
                            of the most of his policies, even though not yet restored to a position
                            of personal power.<note n="4" xml:id="d91fn4">Nagy petitioned to be
                                readmitted to the Hungarian Workers’ Party on October 4, and the
                                Politburo approved this step on October 13.</note> He added that if
                            his advice were asked (which he said it was not) he would advise the
                            Hungarian regime to leave Mr. Gero as Party chief—which would tend to
                            satisfy the Kremlin—and put <persName>Imre Nagy</persName> in as Prime
                            Minister. He said he felt, however, that a move of this kind would take
                            more courage than there was at hand, if put into effect at one time, and
                            that he considered a comeback in stages more likely. He clearly felt, in
                            any event, that a comeback was in the cards. In this connection he
                            observed that the mass ceremony held in connection with the Rajk

                            worked out successfully but which might have brought on demonstrations
                            that would not have been palatable to the regime.</p>
                        <p>He felt that the Soviets were genuinely apprehensive that developments
                            might move too fast and too far here. He added, though, that there were
                            so many cross currents at work that it was hard to disentangle the
                            factors involved. He felt, as he had for a long time, that rivalry
                            exists among the Soviet leaders. He said that Stalinism could return
                            here, and in the U.S.S.R.—though he implied that he doubted this would
                            happen. He agreed that <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> now have a vested
                            interest in their own policies, that they genuinely favor a continuation
                            of present trends within Eastern Europe, up to some point or other, as
                            being in the long-run favorable to themselves. The logic here was that
                            less discontented satellite peoples would give a sounder basis for the
                            “co-operation” of these countries with the U.S.S.R. He left no doubt
                            that in his opinion the Yugoslav Government is not dissatisfied with
                            present trends in the satellites, and would like to have these trends go
                            somewhat farther; in which connection its long-run objective still
                            appeared to be that of greater independence of the other socialist
                            states from Moscow. He said that there were differences in attitude
                            between the U.S.S.R. and the Yugoslav Governments—this in answer to a
                            question as to whether any real identity of views now exists between the
                            two—but added here that this point was not discussed in the Crimea. He
                            said there were ideological differences as well as practical, but that
                            perhaps there had been some slight tendency toward the two growing
                            together. In this connection “growing together” seemed to mean in his
                            mind the Soviet view approaching the Yugoslav, rather than the reverse.
                            On the whole, he considered it likely that present trends would continue

                            that there would be periodic interruptions in the major trends such as
                            had taken place for a period in the middle of this year. He cited the
                            case of Poland, where the Soviet press had emphasized imperialist
                            interference over internal dissatisfaction as a reason for the Poznan
                            riots, and where <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> had
                            said that the U.S.S.R. was not satisfied with everything; but where the
                            Poles had reversed the emphasis on Poznan on their own initiative, and
                            had apparently introduced no changes in answer to <persName
                                corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>’s criticism.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Soldatic remarked that the Hungarians have little knowledge of how
                            things are done in Yugoslavia, but that they have recently been showing
                            more interest. He said here that the regime has so far stuck stubbornly
                            to their principle of agricultural collectivization, but that even in
                            this field he had lately noticed some tendency on their part to begin to
                            think critically—a good sign.</p>
                        <p>In referring again to <persName>Imre Nagy</persName>, Mr. Soldatic said
                            that not only the United States and other Western countries but also
                            Yugoslavia had made a mistake in taking a too critical attitude toward
                            him when he was Prime Minister. He volunteered the opinion, as he has in
                            previous conversations, that we should all avoid putting obstacles in
                            the way of “Nagyism”, and that he thought it would be perhaps well to
                            meet positive or conciliatory moves by the Hungarians with equally
                            positive reciprocation, even though it might not be advisable to take
                            too much initiative in this direction. Here he added the advice that he
                            thought the United States official position could profitably be one of
                            “noting the present trend toward liberalism with satisfaction, while
                            recognizing that the matter was still one of purely internal concern
                            within Hungary”. He claimed that such an attitude would strengthen the
                            position of liberal groups here, as well as undercut Soviet arguments
                            for resisting such liberal trends. He obviously felt that the Soviets
                            still maintain the major part of their control system intact, and are
                            hardly prepared to let their control diminish greatly in the foreseeable
                            future; but felt that, nevertheless, some diminishment would come in the
                            long-run. He considered that present developments were being kept fairly
                            well under control, and thought a sharp clamp-down would be likely only
                            if such developments tended to get out of hand.</p>

                        <p>After some difficulty of arrangement (the Ambassador having been at first
                            reported as “very sick”), the Polish Ambassador came to the Department
                            at 5:00 p.m. on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>’s
                            request for a discussion of the developing situation in Poland. He was
                            accompanied by Mr. Jaroszek, Counselor of the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> began the conversation
                            by saying that the Department was greatly interested in the reports
                            emanating from Poland concerning changes in the government there and the
                            visit of a number of ranking officials of the Soviet Union, headed by
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> continued that there were a
                            great many newspaper reports on the situation but that we did not have
                            much official confirmation as yet.<note n="2" xml:id="d94fn2">According
                                to President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, he
                                received “fragmentary intelligence reports” while he was on the
                                campaign trail flying in the <hi rend="italic">Columbine</hi> toward
                                Denver. He called <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> that
                                evening at 9:30 from the Presidential plane. The Secretary received
                                the call at the theater; no record of the conversation has been
                                found in Department of State files. See <hi rend="italic">Waging
                                    Peace</hi>, pp. 58–60.</note> He emphasized that, as the
                            Ambassador knew, there is very deep interest in the United States in
                            Poland, and he was hopeful that the Ambassador might be able to provide
                            some information which would help in clarifying the confusing welter of
                            information which we had been receiving today.</p>
                        <p>Turning to a collection of news reports on the table before him, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> remarked that there
                            were two or three points which he particularly wanted to ask about. He
                            mentioned first the reports of statements by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> on his arrival in Warsaw to the effect that
                            Soviet blood had been shed in the defense of Poland against the Germans
                            and that the USSR would never permit Polish leaders to turn their
                            country over to “American imperialists”. There were also other
                            allegations and threats reported as having been made by <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> during his visit in Warsaw.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that he wanted to
                            make it clear that, if <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                            >Khrushchev</persName>’s statements had been correctly reported, <pb
                                n="257" xml:id="pg_257" facs="0287"/>they were quite indefensible.
                            The United States, while deeply sympathetic to the Polish people and
                            hopeful of Polish independence, has always recognized that Poland’s
                            destiny is for the people of Poland alone to decide. We could not,
                            therefore, accept the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            allegations, which deserved to be vigorously denounced. The Ambassador
                            replied that the destiny of Poland is indeed close to the Polish people
                            and declared that he had no way of knowing whether <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had in fact made such
                            statements. Mr. Jaroszek commented that the newspaper reporters always
                            tried to make things dramatic; he suggested that the reporters must be
                            very alert since they were quoting things as happening both at the
                            arrival of the Soviet delegation and then later as having come from
                            private meetings at which they were not present. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> pointed out that similar reports
                            were being received from a variety of sources, including American,
                            French and Swedish correspondents.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> then called attention
                            to the stories of troop movements near Warsaw and from East Germany into
                            Poland. There were even some reports of clashes between Soviet and
                            Polish forces. The Ambassador again replied that he was unable to
                            confirm any of these stories, and he frankly admitted there were so many
                            press reports coming in that it was extremely difficult to know what the
                            situation was in fact. He said that it seemed confirmed that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> had been reelected to
                            the Central Committee of the Polish Communist Party but asserted that,
                            so far as he knew, he had not as yet been named First Secretary of the
                            Party. It was the Ambassador’s understanding that elections to the
                            Politburo would be held today or tomorrow. So far as he knew, Marshal
                            Rokossovsky was still a member of the Politburo, although he could not
                            say what changes might be made in the Politburo as a result of the
                            scheduled election.<note n="3" xml:id="d94fn3">When the Eighth Plenum
                                adjourned on October 21, Rokossovskiy was no longer a member of the
                                Politburo. The Natolin faction of the <gloss target="#t_PZPR1"

                                    >Gomulka</persName>, fared badly in the election and Zenon
                                Nowak, Franciszek Mazur, and Franciszek Jozwiak-Witold also lost
                                their places. Newly elected with <persName corresp="#p_GW1"
                                    >Gomulka</persName> and Loga-Sowinski were Stefan Jedrychowski
                                and Jerzy Morawski.</note></p>
                        <p>Mr. Jaroszek mentioned that the Central Committee would also be
                            considering a 6-year economic plan for Poland. In this connection, in
                            what was perhaps a calculated hint,<note n="4" xml:id="d94fn4">In his
                                published account of this meeting, <persName corresp="#p_BJD1"
                                    >Beam</persName> recalled that “Spasowski’s brash young aide
                                loudly interrupted that, of course, assistance from the United

                            economic situation of his country and the problems which the Government

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> also called the
                            Ambassador’s attention to the long article in <hi rend="italic"
                                >Pravda</hi> attacking the Polish press and criticizing articles
                            which had appeared there airing complaints of conditions and urging
                            democratization in Polish life.</p>
                        <p>The atmosphere of the conversation was friendly throughout. The
                            Ambassador, although under a certain amount of strain, appeared to be
                            rather pleased at being called in.</p>

                        <p>On October 20, <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> addressed
                            the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers Party. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> considered it “one of the
                            most dramatic things since <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s speech.” (Memorandum of telephone

                            Conversations) <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> spoke of
                            the evils of the past and described Poznań as the workers’ response to
                            “the distortions of the fundamental principles of socialism”. In that
                            light, he indicated that the “clumsy attempt to present the painful
                            Poznan tragedy as the work of imperialist agents and provocateurs was
                            very naive politically.” “[N]ever and nowhere,” he said, “can they
                            determine the attitude of the working class.” The causes of the upheaval
                            and working class dissatisfaction were “to be found in ourselves, in the
                            leadership of the Party, in the Government”. In the wake of the
                            Twentieth Party Congress, the Polish leadership had not told the whole
                            truth. The resolutions of the Seventh Party Plenum had not acknowledged
                            the failures of the Six-Year Plan (1950–1955). The cult of personality
                            and “domestic Beriaism” had afflicted Poland as well as the Soviet
                            Union. He emphasized that “we are putting an end to it once and for
                            all.” The party had to tell the whole truth and be “clean”. Thus he
                            announced the establishment of a commission of inquiry to look into the
                            errors of the past. For text of the address, see Zinner, <hi

                            <item><hi rend="italic">The Situation</hi>. The USSR has always been
                                unpopular in Poland, as has its satellite regime in Warsaw. That
                                unpopularity has been powerfully compounded lately by growing
                                dissatisfaction with economic conditions, particularly among the
                                large Polish working class. The Poznan riots showed that this
                                situation could pose real dangers to the regime. To avert these
                                dangers, and in response to its own growing internal pressures, the
                                Communist Party re-admitted <persName corresp="#p_GW1"

                                        jeopardize their alliance with the USSR (which they probably
                                        value for a number of reasons, including the protection

                                        probably do not now contemplate cutting back the investment
                                        program, but this would seem to be necessary if any lasting
                                        improvement in living standards is to be attained. Failing
                                        such an improvement, working class dissatisfaction—now
                                        alleviated by a wave of nationalist rejoicing—will re-occur,
                                        and will pose problems for a regime which can no longer rely
                                        on Stalin-type police controls. Both a new trade policy and
                                        a cutback in investment would result in some unscrambling of

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> As in case of recent writers’ meeting
                            Legation believes media should give full factual coverage, without
                            comment, to events at two meetings. News of meeting in Gyor has not yet
                            been carried into Budapest press. In coverage of student meeting <hi
                                rend="italic">Szabad Nep</hi> devotes space to whistling in dark,
                            saying students will not exploit youth movement for any kind of
                            restoration. Legation recommends that coverage, especially as regards
                            demands withdrawal Soviet troops, be fast <pb n="263" xml:id="pg_263"
                                facs="0293"/>so that maximum advantage be taken of ever-mounting
                            demands of Hungarians. These two meetings give media their first
                            opportunity to break long US silence on question Soviet troops
                            maintained here. In addition to media following in wake of Hungarian
                            demands and giving publicity to them, Legation feels Department might,
                            as recommended in Legation despatch 156,<note n="10" xml:id="d97fn10"
                                >The reference is unclear for there is no despatch 156.</note> now
                            all the more reconsider its policy of maintaining official silence on
                            question legal status of Soviet troops here.</p>
                        <p>Student meeting attended briefly by two Legation officers after telephone
                            call from student representative who said students inviting all foreign
                            newspapermen, foreign diplomats, and anyone else who wants to come.
                            Legation feels that since meeting was open, word of anti-Soviet
                            statements and audience reaction could have been carried out of country
                            within 24 hours by any number of means, and thus Legation has no
                            objection to immediate use by media of its observations, if above-noted
                            restriction on comment re talks with Yugoslavia is observed and if media
                            plays it straight without attempting to make any inflammatory
                            comments.</p>

                            copies in torchlight demonstration. Red Star on Parliament extinguished,
                            as were Red Stars all over city within short time. Crowd repeatedly
                            called for Nagy, who when finally appeared asked demonstrators bide
                            their time and wait for natural developments, which he said would lead
                            to democratization in Hungary. Crowd hardly listened and Nagy said “you
                            called me here to give my opinion and I’m giving it”. He asked crowd to

                            <item>It seems to me that the crucial feature in the Polish scene is to
                                be found in the forces that brought <persName corresp="#p_GW1"
                                    >Gomulka</persName> back to power and enabled and pushed him to

                            <item><p>I would think it plain, after Poznan, that popular pressures
                                    had made the Communist Party itself not wholly reliable as an
                                    instrument of administration and control in Poland.</p>
                                <p>We are much too prone to forget that Communists are human too. It
                                    must have been difficult in Poland to be the agent of a regime
                                    subservient to the Russians and responsible for a miserable
                                    economic situation as well. When the Soviets began to
                                    de-Stalinize and to talk of different roads to Socialism, it was
                                    inevitable that many of these people should have swung around to
                                    nationalist, anti-Soviet attitudes because these were the
                                    attitudes of their constituents, and indeed of their Polish
                                    selves. The Party officials and activists—the essential nucleus
                                    of the control system—probably were ready to be subverted, in
                                    this sense, rather quickly. Poznan demonstrated how far the
                                    process had gone.</p></item>

                            <item><persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName>, who is a Pole, an
                                anti-Stalinist, and evidently a legitimate party hero beyond that,
                                was trotted out as a response to this intra-Party restiveness, which
                                in turn traces to popular discontents. He is a people’s choice, once
                                removed. His indispensable characteristic, from the point of view of
                                the other party leaders, is that he can be expected to command the
                                loyalty of the all important Communist cadres and thereby to keep
                                the system running.</item>

                            <item>It is not believable, however, that <persName corresp="#p_GW1"
                                    >Gomulka</persName> and his nationalist-Communist following will
                                simply be able to carry on a program slightly modified from the
                                past. Everybody seems to agree that the bleak economic situation was
                                the instant cause of popular unrest. And why are living standards so
                                low? Because the Plan requires that they be low. Willy-nilly, the
                                Plan will have to be changed. Pressures within the party will assure
                                that.</item>

                            <item>In other words, the emphasis in Poland will have to shift,
                                noticeably, from heavy industry and military security to welfare. I
                                don’t suggest that this will take place in one great swoop. There
                                will be heavy transitional costs in changing the economic program
                                and this <pb n="267" xml:id="pg_267" facs="0297"/>fact, plus inertia
                                plus the Russians, will limit the pace of change. The direction of
                                change, nevertheless, is for practical purposes given by the
                                situation in Poland. I do not see how it can be stopped or reversed,
                                short of the reoccupation of Poland.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item><p>This is of the most far-reaching significance. For one thing,
                                    it will have direct effects throughout the Bloc. Polish coal
                                    used to warm Polish houses or to exchange for Swedish consumer
                                    goods will not be available for, say, East German industry. All
                                    of the Plans will need adjustment, downward, as the Poles change
                                    their Plan.</p>
                                <p>More important, the pressures elsewhere to imitate the Poles will
                                    be irresistible. We can be sure that Communist officials in the
                                    other satellites are similarly susceptible to popular attitudes.
                                    They too are going to press for measures to placate the workers
                                    and other articulate sections of the population. To keep the
                                    domestic Communist parties in control, the shift toward welfare
                                    goals will have to be a general one. The alternative will be to
                                    make the Soviet armed forces a direct governing instrument in
                                    Eastern Europe.</p></item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>It is useful to remember that the Bloc nations, like all
                                full-employment economies, have no margin for maneuver. If they are
                                to have big housing programs, then investment and labor have to be
                                diverted from industry. If agriculture is to get more investment,
                                some other sector has to get less. Even if total output were to
                                continue in these circumstances to grow rapidly—as could happen—its
                                composition would tend to become more like our own or that of
                                Western Europe and less like that of a single-mindedly military
                                state.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>That is a consummation to be welcomed for itself. One might
                                suspect, moreover, that it will carry with it softening tendencies
                                in the political field as well. The main rationale for the terror
                                has always been to repress a population resentful of the privations
                                imposed on it. If the privations become more bearable, the excuse
                                for terror will diminish. Not that Communist regimes will shortly
                                become liberal democracies with effective Bills of Rights. They may
                                become gradually less repressive, however.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>I come back to the point that all this will take some considerable
                                time. If we look for the demise of Communism next year we shall be
                                disappointed. If we are patient, and if nothing happens that the
                                Soviets can construe as a new and important threat to their national
                                security, we have good reason to hope for a desirable modification
                                in the internal operations of the European Soviet bloc.</item>
                            <label>10.</label>
                            <item>We need not be much concerned, it seems to me, if the Poles come
                                back from Moscow next month with a big Soviet loan. This won’t undo
                                what has happened so far as “independence” from the USSR is at
                                issue. And if the Soviets are willing to finance more consumer goods
                                for the Poles—which is what the loan will amount to—there is much to
                                be said, from our point of view, for privately cheering <pb n="268"
                                    xml:id="pg_268" facs="0298"/>Moscow on. There will have to be a
                                net deduction from Bloc resources, no matter how one views it.
                                (Indeed, though I would not press the point too far, it may be
                                better the Soviets should help to finance the new course than that
                                we do so. For our aid might help, all things equal, to sustain a
                                Polish program emphasizing heavy industry, without reducing total
                                Bloc capabilities at all.)</item>
                            <label>11.</label>
                            <item>Our policy line in this limited sense is clearly enough marked. We
                                should lie low, seek little, and reap the sure rewards of patience.
                                If the Poles should look to us or to Western Europe for economic
                                help, it would be necessary politically to respond, but even in this
                                we ought to proceed carefully. A process is under way that can be
                                checked only by forceful Russian action. Although there might be
                                many gains for us if we could stir things up to the point of causing
                                direct Soviet intervention, that course would carry very sizable
                                risks. We can make smaller but still substantial gains at virtually
                                no risk. I would suppose it to be prudent foreign policy to take
                                these latter gains.</item>

                        <p>It is in the interest of the U.S. to break or weaken the monolithic unity
                            of the Soviet-dominated power bloc. We have shown by our policy towards
                            Yugoslavia that we can have better relations with a Communist country
                            when it exercises greater independence from Moscow. It is in our
                            interest to encourage the present developments in Poland towards an
                            increase in Polish self-determination as a step towards weakening the
                            power balance in the Soviet bloc. We believe that this can best be done
                            by avoiding giving the Stalinist forces in the Soviet Union and in
                            Poland any justification for arguing that the present anti-Stalinist
                            developments in Poland are supported by capitalist enemies. In our
                            output we should also avoid inciting unrest in Poland and in other
                            countries of Eastern Europe to such a point as to give the Soviet
                            leaders any pretext for using force to subdue national communism in
                            Poland and the other satellites.<note n="3" xml:id="d102fn3">News Policy

                            should not be based on legalistic grounds (which we consider weak) but
                            on brazen occupation nature troop stationments both before and after
                            signing Austrian peace treaty and Warsaw Pact. Fact that functions and

                            as well as present use, gives ample basis, we believe, for protest.</p>

                        <p>Re Hungary—apparently the fighting is developing in quite a big way and
                            there is clear evidence of considerable Soviet military activity in the
                            area to try to repress it. We are thinking of the possibility of
                            bringing it to the SC. From a political standpoint the Sec. is worried
                            that it will be said that here are the great moments and when they came
                            and these fellows were ready to stand up and die, we were caught napping
                            and doing nothing. L. mentioned Poland. The Sec. said that was different
                            and there is more excuse to take this to the SC. He wishes L. would
                            think about it and possibly for tomorrow. L. said calling for a
                            cease-fire. The Sec. mentioned asking the British and French to

                            though the Sec. thinks they would vote with us. L. will go to work on it
                            and wait for word. The Sec. said to keep it close. L. will go into the

                                <p>The people of the United States are deeply shocked to learn that
                                    the armed forces of the Soviet Union are being used against the
                                    civilian population of Hungary, on the eve of what we had hoped
                                    would be better days for that unhappy country. Gunfire cannot be
                                    a final answer to the legitimate demands of a people for a
                                    decent standard of living and the restoration of the basic
                                    freedoms which are the birth right of the people of Louis
                                    Kossuth. We shall follow with deepest concern the tragic events
                                    that are even now continuing in the hope that the aspirations of
                                    the Hungarian people for a better life shall not be denied.</p>

                        <p>Unnumbered. Believe that broadcast of “Americana” to Hungary during
                            people’s rebellion and description of same as “riots” counterproductive
                            and should be immediately reexamined. Staff members here could not
                            understand how <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> Hungarian from
                            Washington last night could tell Hungarians about <hi rend="italic"
                                >Globemaster</hi> landing on Arctic shelf, activities of Soviet
                            election observers and cancer research while people were dying in the
                            streets. Feel such treatment could only cause dismay and resentment.
                            Effect further aggravated by fact that <gloss target="#t_BBC1"
                                >BBC</gloss> Hungarian which followed immediately after Washington
                            origination carried two sharp commentaries on the situation, strongly
                            condemning use of Soviet forces to put down uprising and saying that
                            while it was difficult to tell at moment whether intervention due to
                            Nagy or Gero whoever responsible should be removed.</p>
                        <p>Since I know several members of Washington Hungarian Unit to be very able
                            journalists is it possible that overconcern with policy implementation
                            and apprehension over possibility unfavorable reactions from persons
                            within and outside Agency is throwing them off balance and out of touch
                            with audience? I have been getting similar reactions to output of other
                            Washington language desks for some time and if valid to any considerable
                            extent would of course do great damage not only to <gloss
                                target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> but to position of U.S. in the eyes of
                            the people behind the Iron Curtain.</p>
                        <p>New Subject: Reur request for guidance suggestions. During current phase
                            when Hungarian uprisings seem still to be continuing would suggest heavy
                            cross-reporting of Hungarian and Polish events plus worldwide expression
                            of solidarity and sympathy for Hungarian people. If and when uprising
                            quelled would proceed to next phase which would give heaviest emphasis
                            to use of Soviet troops, tanks and planes to crush attempts of Hungarian
                            people to free themselves from the yoke of communist tyranny. Also
                            believe we should seek attributed comment highlighting the fact that
                            Soviets stand exposed before the world and that bloody suppression of
                            Hungarian freedom aspirations may well mark the beginning of the end of
                            the Soviet empire.</p>

                        <p>Could you give us some indication of when we can expect revised Soviet

                            useful, particularly concerning failure of cooperatives.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_TH1">Trivers</persName>: Failure of collectives is
                            its strongest point.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRO1">Blake</persName>: It is strong break with the
                            past.</p>
                        <p>Boerner: It lends authenticity to much of our line. It admits in one
                            statement that Communist statistics are fake, production is off,
                            industrial work is required on Sunday, etc.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FEL1">Freers</persName>: Useful to report it back
                            to Russia.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_REL1">Revey</persName>: It also stresses the cult
                            of the individual.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FEL1">Freers</persName>: It will be possible to
                            exploit the speech for a long time.</p>

                                >Gomulka</persName>’s statements regarding ties with Russia are
                            strong and devoutly meant.</p>
                        <p>Cox: We should wait to see how much popular support <persName

                            period because of his apparent anti-Soviet stand. When time passes he

                            circular letter to the Security Council. It will not take any stand on
                            the action of the Hungarian Government itself. It will go after the idea
                            that the Soviets have used their troops. It might even strengthen the
                            hand of the Hungarians against Russia. It should make it possible for
                            anyone to open debate. We are going to ask the support of the French,
                            British, Belgians, and Australians. Planning to circulate it tomorrow. I
                            understand the free Hungarian representatives in New York, the National
                            Council, want to take some action. They want to go to <gloss

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_TH1">Trivers</persName>: They can present a
                            petition to the Secretary General, but he won’t circulate it unless a

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName>: The Catholic Church, rather
                            than the Government, would be the appropriate organ to take such

                            remained in Legation. Intermittent shots heard through night. Quieter

                        <p>Heavy gun fire from Parliament area. Some Legation reports that some

                            with crowds. Budapest radio broadcasts statement that isolated groups

                        <p>Do you people believe this fighting is going to spread further?</p>
                        <p>Have no way of knowing but seems very possible that it will spread.</p>
                        <p>Believe non-Hungarian stationed Soviet troops pulled into Budapest over
                            night. Prefix on truck numbers is Soviet “F”. Have report that no
                            airplane service to or from Budapest. Train service probably interrupted
                            and no information on conditions Vienna Budapest highway, except some
                            reports of disturbances in Gyor. Also heard reports of disturbances
                            Debrecen and Szeged and Miskolc.</p>
                        <p>Any questions?</p>
                        <p>Have none at present.</p>
                        <p>Strength of Soviet troops which arrived in Budapest initially at 0400
                            hours local time 24 October estimated to be one mechanized infantry
                            division. Hungarian troops held in background. Soviet doing bulk of
                            fighting. Some Hungarian troops known to have joined the crowd.</p>
                        <p>Situation in front of Legation building now quiet, fighting seems to have
                            left this immediate area.</p>

                            due to presence of insurgents firing from roof. All Americans and

                            and front of building sprayed with machine gun fire from Russian troops

                        <p>Some members in crowd before Legation have been shouting for United
                            States assistance.</p>
                        <p>Army and Legation officers have personally observed several instances of
                            Soviet tanks going over to crowds just prior to firing. These were seen
                            flying Hungarian flags.</p>
                        <p>Still on floor, reasons for bad typing.</p>

                        <p>Legation wife observed at 1045 local time, 76 Soviet trucks fully loaded
                            with troops field kitchens towing howitzers proceeding from east in
                            direction of Parliament. All trucks bearing numbers beginning with
                            Cyrillic letter “F”. Agriculture Attaché has observed trucks bearing

                        <p>Yes, still with you.</p>
                        <p>Appears to be rather quiet around the Legation area again.</p>

                        <p>Yes, will stay with you until you advise.</p>
                        <p>Just so long we don’t get cut off is what I’m worried about.</p>
                        <p>Budapest radio has just announced Gero has been relieved of the party and
                            has been replaced by <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> who is
                            to speak over radio shortly. Things seem little quieter at moment and

                        <p>Hope you can hold circuit until officers arrive.</p>

                        <p>Any more running commentary?</p>
                        <p>Seems that crowd has left from in front of Legation and things again seem
                            rather quiet. However, numerous times we thought this whole mess was
                            over but it starts up very suddenly without any <pb n="283"

                            Earlier this morning I had the printer on floor typing from prone
                            position with many more typing errors than appearing on this later
                            transmission.</p>
                        <p>I’m sure you did best you could.</p>
                        <p>I sure hope so. Was rather afraid of bullets coming in the window since
                            this Telex room is facing the crowd and would have more protection on
                            floor. Fortunately no shells or the like came this direction.</p>
                        <p>That’s good.</p>

                        <p>Here answer to question one:</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MKRM1">McKisson</persName> from <persName
                                corresp="#p_BNS1">Barnes</persName>: This is a battle situation and
                            we have no idea what is going to happen. Our impression yesterday was
                            that in view of he [<hi rend="italic">him</hi>] being blamed for calling
                            in Soviet troops, that he lost a great deal of popularity; where he
                            stands today and how the people would view a further retreat from
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> to Nagy, we do not know.
                            We presume Nagy is to all intents and purposes Premier. Should the blame
                            for the calling of Soviet troops now be placed on Gero and he made a
                            scapegoat for all this is going on now, and if he made further
                            concessions, he might have a chance. But we do not know enough to say
                            anything very certainly.</p>

                            end Parliament Square. South of Parliament, but unknown to what degree
                            east, anti-government crowds freely moving. Gellert Bridge appears under
                            control of anti-government forces but tanks on Chain Bridge unknown as
                            to allegiance. Soviet setting up heavy guns back in Varosliget Park. If

                            considerable bolstering. Immediate problem is careful study of

                            needed integrate these balances into new five year plan. This will
                            require search for more efficient methods know-how in industry as well
                            as exploiting normal trade and credit opportunities as may be

                            Polish authorities (even before present government changes took place)
                            is to get Poland on equal footing with all powers, including USSR, in
                            matter foreign trade and commerce. Poland has more than enough natural
                            resources, manpower to take care itself economically if only it could
                            trade in usual and customary manner with all nations. He mentioned
                            restrictive “controls” of west which prevent Poland from doing this.
                            While he did not so state, got impression from his repetition of
                            independence in trade that USSR also was in his mind.</p>
                        <p>He said many peoples in west and here either distort or misunderstand

                            and (B) in continuance ties with USSR, Poland’s ally, as <persName

                            all Poland’s textile mills are geared handle short staple cotton for
                            which US was best source—Egyptian cotton, for instance, was no use as
                            mills could not handle it properly. Poland would like buy cotton, not
                            accept as gift, but needs some credit for one, two or three years.
                            Likewise, Poland needs wheat and adequate provision has been made to buy
                            same but, even so, short and long term credit was sometimes needed
                            because of temporary lack adequate foreign exchange. Said Poland’s
                            industry, citing coal mining, could learn much from technical know-how
                            of US. In brief, he thought this sort of “aid”, not gifts, from US,
                            supplemented by long or short term credits through commercial channels
                            (“consortium” mentioned) was solution.</p>
                        <p>At this point digressed to say that word “aid” had come to have
                            unfortunate political connotation which carries with it stigma that
                            donor would or has right interfere in internal affairs of recipient.
                            This connotation, which he termed unfortunate, made it hard, if not
                            impossible, for his government to accept any sort assistance which
                            carried with it any show connotation that internal affairs of Poland
                            were being inhibited or restricted. Type of assistance through mutual
                            trade, commercial, cultural, scientific and technical exchanges, which
                            he spoke of above, would avoid this problem.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, he said he appreciated our interest in Poland in this
                            matter.</p>

                        <p>The Pres. returned the call and the Sec. said we are giving thought to
                            circulating a letter to the SC re Hungary etc.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d111fn2"><persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>
                                had spoken to the Secretary on the telephone some 25 minutes
                                earlier. In that conversation, the “Sec. explained the practice of
                                sending a letter and it does not go on the agenda and is not a
                                resolution. It might hold it for the time being to see what
                                develops. The Frenchman is Pres. this month.” The need for action
                                resulted from the apprehension that the Hungarian émigrés “might
                                jump the gun—by going to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> via
                                the Latinos.” When he was asked whether the letter might not be
                                counterproductive, <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
                                    Dulles</persName> replied that “it is a close question and he
                                would like to think about it.” He also “mentioned sending message to
                                Nehru—he thinks if he gets consulted and feels he is in things, he
                                would operate differently.” (Memorandum of telephone conversation by
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BPD1">Bernau</persName>; <hi rend="italic"
                                    >ibid</hi>.)</note> It is a close question re doing it. The
                            Pres. asked if the Sec. talked to the Br. and Fr., and the Sec. said no.
                            We are planning to send cables tonight. He doubts they will be prepared
                            to act quickly and if you don’t do it tomorrow the Sec. doubts it is
                            worth doing at all. Why? It is hot and better understood now. The Pres.
                            said he is not so sure. If you act in deliberate fashion, that may be
                            better. The Pres. does not think we should walk in this alone. He thinks
                            it would look as if we were doing it for internal. . . . <note n="3"
                                xml:id="d111fn3">Ellipsis in the source text.</note> He thinks we
                            could concert with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries and
                            certainly with the big ones. The Sec. thinks they will be reluctant to
                            come along with us—as they will interpret it as being an election move.
                            The Pres. said some agreement from our allies no matter who puts it in
                            would take the noose off. The Pres. said to tell them we have it
                            seriously in mind and to reply promptly. Monday<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d111fn4">October 29.</note> would not be fatal. The Sec.
                            said the Latin countries would take the initiative—Peru and Cuba are on
                            the SC. It might look as though we were in back of it. The Pres. said if
                            they are friends enough and would do it, he would be happy. He would not
                            do it alone. The Sec. explained just what circulating a letter means.
                            The Pres. said he would like to hear from our allies—even a grudging
                            assent. The Pres. said he will be there first thing in the a.m. so let’s
                            talk then.<note n="5" xml:id="d111fn5"><persName corresp="#p_DJF1"

                            are against it, at least we would have a reason for not acting. It will
                            be private in the first instance. If we had to explain I think we would
                            let it be known. We want to know how they feel re the letter and
                            possibly join. L. said make it a resolution and settle for a letter. The

                            tactics. L. does not think much of it as a matter of substance but gives
                            you something to give up. The Sec. said the Pres. does not think it has
                            to be done tomorrow. The Sec. had the feeling we should act fairly
                            quickly. L. will be available at all times. The Sec. said we will

                                extent of Soviet colonialism in Europe. In order to minimize

                                democratization, the United States hoped to encourage Yugoslavia to
                                use its influence with the Soviets to advance these ends.

                            in due course be along lines Winiewicz comment reference telegram. On
                            other hand, if we give publicity, Polish reply likely either be couched
                            in temporizing, ambiguous terms to allay Soviet fears that Poland coming
                            under US influence or downrightly unfavorable similar previous responses
                            to aid offers.</p>
                        <p>In last analysis, question of desirability or undesirability publicity
                            soon depends largely upon Department’s purpose in offering aid at this
                            time. If offer is attempt create further discord between regime and
                            Polish people and between both of these and USSR . . . , then early
                            publicity is desirable as regime in present circumstances will have to
                            decline or temporize and incur ill will Polish people.</p>
                        <p>On other hand, if objective stems from desire extend some form of aid
                            which would benefit Polish people as whole, notwithstanding our
                            unacceptance regime as representing will Polish people and unwillingness
                            enhance its prestige, then early publicity likely, as indicated above,
                            to create situation which would postpone possibility of such aid for
                            longer period than otherwise might be case.</p>
                        <p>While on balance, my preference would be that no publicity be given now
                            or until situation here, complicated by events in Hungary, has become
                            somewhat settled and clarified, realize there may be other

                        <p>Winiewicz is notably fast on his feet and gave our Ambassador a clever

                            nevertheless it is certain that our approach will be reported higher as
                            Winiewicz himself said in describing it as “important”. It is true that
                            the Polish formal reply may take the same line as Winiewicz’ remarks but
                            the seed has been planted of the idea that recourse to the US is
                            possible. This knowledge, whether or not the Poles communicate it to the
                            Soviets, may fortify them in their forthcoming talks in Moscow.</p>

                            the clear from our Embassy in Budapest.<note n="2" xml:id="d116fn2">See

                            order to avoid being shot at. The following were the main points in the
                            cable.</p>
                        <p>In the first place, Soviet troops had arrived in Budapest at four o’clock
                            in the morning on Wednesday last.<note n="3" xml:id="d116fn3">October
                                24.</note> These troops were from the First Mechanized Division. In
                            addition, certain reinforcements had arrived from Soviet forces in
                            Rumania. The cable stated that the native Hungarian troops had thus far
                            been held in the background, with the Soviet forces doing the actual
                            fighting. Some Hungarian troops had already gone over to the rebels. It
                            was also being alleged that certain Soviet tanks had gone over to the
                            Hungarian rebels. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            expressed some skepticism at this report of Soviet military defectors,
                            but indicated that it might possibly be true. In any event, at as late
                            as eleven o’clock on Wednesday morning the Embassy had stated that tanks
                            were fighting tanks in the streets of Budapest. The cable went on to
                            provide other details of the fighting in Budapest, including the large
                            demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy, in the course of which the
                            demonstrators called for U.S. assistance. As late as yesterday evening
                            many sectors of the city were still in the hands of rebel bands.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the above intelligence, press reports early this morning
                            stated that the situation had quieted somewhat in Budapest itself, and
                            there was a partial lifting of the curfew. On the other hand, there were
                            reports of disorders in at least two other Hungarian cities.</p>

                            summarized above. Nevertheless, he would give to the Council certain

                            in Hungary.</p>
                        <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0326"/>
                        <p>In the first place, there was bound to be much soul-searching in Moscow
                            as to whether a <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName>-type
                            regime could be permitted to function in Poland in view of what has
                            happened in Hungary. Secondly, Soviet intervention in Hungary may have
                            been due to Soviet unwillingness to submit to a second humiliation after
                            Poland. On the other hand, the Hungarian revolt had from the outset
                            exhibited much clearer anti-Soviet and anti-Communist bias than had the
                            Polish disorders.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, the Hungarian revolt may demonstrate the inability of a moderate
                            national Communist regime to survive in any of the satellites. What has
                            happened would seem to indicate only two alternatives: One, either to
                            return to a hard Stalinist regime, or two, to permit developments in the
                            direction of genuine democracy. It had become evident that the revolt in
                            Budapest had early taken a far more serious turn than that in Warsaw.
                            Indeed, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> believed that
                            the revolt in Hungary constituted the most serious threat yet to be
                            posed to continued Soviet control of the satellites. It confronted
                            Moscow with a very harsh dilemma: Either to revert to a harsh Stalinist
                            policy, or to permit democratization to develop in the satellites to a
                            point which risked the complete loss of Soviet control of the
                            satellites.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then commented on the
                            effect of these events on neutral nations such as India, and on
                            Yugoslavia. He emphasized that while Marshal Tito had approved of what
                            had happened in Poland, he had remained silent on Hungary. The <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZMGK1">Marshal</persName> may well view what has
                            occurred in Hungary with genuine alarm. Certainly any free election
                            would make abundantly clear that there was no popular support for any
                            kind of Communist regime in Hungary or in Poland.</p>
                        <p>Various members of the Council then commented on the possibility of an
                            ultimate replacement of Soviet influence in the satellites by a Western
                            orientation for these countries. In connection with this discussion
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> mentioned a
                            telegram which had come in to the State Department early this morning
                            from our Ambassador in Warsaw.<note n="4" xml:id="d116fn4">Telegram 540

                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> concerned
                            themselves with the Polish economy and Poland’s resources. The
                            Ambassador concluded that the Polish economy could be made viable if the
                            Poles were permitted to trade anywhere they wanted to in normal
                            fashion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>, reverting again
                            to the impact of these events on third countries, pointed out that while
                            Communist China had welcomed the developments in Poland, it had been
                            silent on what had <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0327"/>occurred in
                                Hungary.<note n="5" xml:id="d116fn5">Circular telegram 319, October
                                27, addressed the question of Communist Chinese support for the
                                Polish effort to escape Soviet domination. The addressees were
                                instructed to rebut any suggestion that the Chinese were supporting
                                the Poles. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 748.00/10–2756)</note>
                            Nevertheless, the Chinese Communists may not be unhappy about Hungarian
                            developments. If so, this could be the beginning of the first rift
                            between Communist China and the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
                                Dulles</persName> had had any information about the Czech reaction
                            to these events. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            replied that he had very little on this point.<note n="6"

                        <p>Turning to the immediate future, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
                                Dulles</persName> stated his belief that the Soviet leaders in
                            Moscow would try to convey an outward impression of continued unity of
                            belief and action. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName>, for

                                >Khrushchev</persName> had been seen together at a recent reception
                            in Moscow.<note n="7" xml:id="d116fn7">Reported in telegram 924 from

                                >Bohlen</persName> said he had never seen them looking so grim. In
                            any event, the current Soviet leadership was certainly on the defensive,
                            and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is probably being
                            held responsible for what has happened. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s days may well be numbered. It was quite
                            possible that upon <persName corresp="#p_ZMGK1">Zhukov</persName> would
                            devolve the choice of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                            >Khrushchev</persName>’s successor. Indeed, it was even possible that
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZMGK1">Zhukov</persName> himself would be
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s successor.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked if there were further questions. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> inquired if there was
                            any information as to the reaction of the United States Communist Party.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> replied that he
                            had read several editorials in <hi rend="italic">The New York Daily
                                Worker</hi>. These editorials had welcomed what had happened in
                            Poland, but had little to say about Hungary. The President referred to
                            the Attorney General’s recent report,<note n="8" xml:id="d116fn8"
                                >Attorney General <persName corresp="#p_BHJ1">Herbert Brownell,

                            added that he thought it had been wise of him to issue his statement
                            with respect to Hungary.<note n="9" xml:id="d116fn9">See <ref

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then informed the
                            Council that the State Department had just sent out messages to all the
                            friendly co-signatories of the Hungarian Peace Treaty, to ascertain if
                            any of these countries was disposed to take any action in the United

                                approaching the Soviets at that time. (Department of State, Central

                        <p>The President, referring to the message on Poland’s economy and
                            resources, stated that the question of trade interested him immensely,
                            in view of his long-held conviction that the United States should trade
                            as widely as possible with the Soviet satellites. On the same point,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> stated that one
                            sentence in the telegram from Warsaw had emphasized the fact that nearly
                            all the Polish textile mills were geared to use U.S. short-staple cotton
                            rather than Egyptian long-staple cotton.<note n="12" xml:id="d116fn12"

                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, would be of
                            interest to the Secretary of Agriculture. The President agreed that this
                            was worth thinking about.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> recalled a talk
                            he had had with <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> several
                            years ago, before the latter had been put in prison. On this occasion
                                <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> had protested his
                            friendliness toward the United States and had also outlined his desire
                            to follow an independent road to Socialism in Poland. With reference to
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>’s observation,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> stated that
                                <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName>’s long speech a few
                            days ago represented the most violent denunciation of the entire Soviet
                            economic system which had ever [been] issued anywhere from any source.
                            He had accordingly sent copies of this speech all over this Government
                            and to many places overseas.</p>
                        <p>At this point, Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>
                            inquired whether, in view of the great significance of what was taking
                            place in Hungary and Poland, it would not be advisable for the President
                            to call a special meeting of the National Security Council to discuss
                            the whole problem of Hungary and Poland. The President replied that he
                            was not sure that discussion in the National Security Council was the
                            best initial step. He did believe, however, that the responsible
                            departments and agencies should proceed at once to formulate the
                            clearest possible analysis of what had happened in these two countries.
                            Such an analysis could then be presented to the National Security
                            Council. Such a procedure he believed better than to plunge right into a
                            discussion in the Council on these difficult subjects.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> pointed out that
                            basic decisions would have to be taken presently by the Soviet Union.
                            They would either have to revert to the old harsh policy of Stalin
                            toward the satellites, or else they would have to let things go on as
                            they were going. The President <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0329"
                            />replied that if the Soviets did revert to the Stalin policies, they
                            would stand bankrupt before the whole world. Pointing out that he had a
                            memorandum on his desk,<note n="13" xml:id="d116fn13">Not further
                                identified. The Presedent noted in his diary for October 26 that he

                            another question which was possibly being posed for the Soviet Union. In
                            view of the serious deterioration of their position in the satellites,
                            might they not be tempted to resort to very extreme measures and even to
                            precipitate global war? This was a situation which must be watched with
                            the utmost care. After all, observed the President, Hitler had known
                            well, from the first of February 1945, that he was licked. Yet he had
                            carried on to the very last and pulled down Europe with him in his
                            defeat. The Soviets might even develop some desperate mood such as
                            this.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> wondered if it
                            would not be prudent to try to get some message to <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZMGK1">Marshal Zhukov</persName> indicating that the
                            achievement of freedom in the Soviet satellites should not be considered
                            by the Soviet Union as posing any real threat to the national security
                            of the USSR. We should make clear that this development would not impel
                            the Western powers to make any warlike move against the Soviet Union.
                            The President stated that he did not believe such a move would be
                            worthwhile. He doubted if the Soviet leaders genuinely feared an
                            invasion by the Western powers. He thought that a better procedure would
                            be to ask the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board to
                            provide an analysis of what had happened in Hungary and Poland and to
                            make any suggestions which it could as to what the United States might
                            do in the light of these developments. All of the members of the
                            National Security Council had representatives on the Planning Board and
                            could make their views available.</p>

                            out, statements by the President and the Secretary of State, Soviet
                            treaty commitments, etc.</p>

                                    <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> by the United States, and
                                this would be a great threat in Soviet eyes to their own security.

                                clear that we are willing to have Hungary be established on the

                            giving a speech and he thought he could put something like this in the

                            developments in Hungary up to moment increasingly suggest desirability

                            assuming proportions which may in turn bring Red counter-action of major
                            proportions. Emotional reaction to this would be very serious certainly
                            in this country. It seems to me of great importance we should promptly
                            focus <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> attention on this situation and
                            at same time obtain opportunity of informal talk with Soviet Permanent

                            with the Canadians and Australians, all support inscribing the matter
                            today on the Security Council agenda. Although there was earlier thought
                            of simply sending a letter, as long as the others want to go as far as
                            inscription, we should too, he thought. The President indicated

                            manifested.</p>
                        <p>The President said he would be unable to participate directly, because of

                        <p>Within Hungary itself, the revolt has become widespread, the Secretary
                            reported. Large sections of the Hungarian armed forces have gone over to
                            the dissidents, and throughout the countryside there are large areas in
                            opposition to the regime. Also, signs of condemnation of the Communists
                            are arising all over Europe. In Italy, Spain and France there are strong
                            demonstrations for the Hungarians. (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"

                                on how to bring an international forum into Hungary. The Legation
                                accepted the information, but declined to offer advice or give the
                                impression that negotiations were in process. (<hi rend="italic"

                                n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0341"/>is rather immaterial. What is
                            important is dilemma with which he claims the “new provisional
                            revolutionary government and civil defense committee” is faced.
                            Representatives of “provisional government” begged Legation for advice
                            as to what they should do, for he claimed they had been in contact with
                            Nagy who stated he will do anything in order to keep present
                            government’s system in Hungary and that (further quoting Nagy) unless
                            opposition ceases horrible consequences will follow. This dilemma faces
                            all insurgent forces whether under “control” of “new government” or
                            acting in isolation. It can be summed up in proposition that Soviets
                            under legal cover of Hungarian Communist Government will engage in
                            ruthless suppression if insurgents don’t surrender; and insurgents have
                            complete lack of confidence in government carrying out promised
                            concessions if they do capitulate. Insurgents thus faced with following
                            narrow range of alternatives. (A) Fight to end and die and in process
                            see many of unarmed population also suffer; (B) fight and die in hope
                            hold out long enough for some outside intervention or pressure to modify
                            regime and Soviet intention and/or capability of ruthless suppression;
                            (C) accept government’s acting in good faith in promised concessions,
                            and surrender. One decision already made by insurgent forces against
                            this last option, as deadline hour of acceptance was approached at 2200
                            hours Friday<note n="3" xml:id="d125fn3">October 26.</note> and
                            insurgents broadcast they will keep fighting till demands met.</p>
                        <p>Evil choices facing insurgents seem to pose most critical political and
                            moral problem for US Government. US cannot by complete inaction condone
                            Soviet exercises of their military capabilities in suppressing this
                            struggle. This leads logically to question of what US Government can do
                            to increase chances of second alternative becoming realization.</p>
                        <p>Legation does not pretend to know all international legal merits of case.
                            However it is understood from western broadcasts that France, UK, and US
                            are associating themselves in bringing situation before <gloss

                            Legation’s impression that France had taken initiative in this move.
                            Legation strongly believes, both from practical standpoint of
                            maintaining stature and influence among captive peoples and because of
                            moral responsibility to stand behind past official statements implying
                            support for captive peoples, that US Government should lead and
                            vigorously press Hungarian case in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and
                            use all its influence to mobilize world opinion against ruthless
                            suppression of Hungarian insurgents by Soviet power.</p>
                        <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312" facs="0342"/>
                        <p>Legation fully realizes heavy responsibility of decision to support, and
                            risks involved in overtly supporting, Hungarian people against Soviets
                            by material means. Legation does not have clear view of possible
                            alternatives open to US Government between extremes of “legalistic” case
                            before <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and material support of
                            insurgents. But alternatives between extremes must exist, and for some
                            alternatives risk attached might not be too great. Legation believes it
                            to be in US interest, in view of widespread and violent reaction against
                            Communist rule by Hungarian people, that careful consideration be given
                            to means for supporting insurgent population and that some risk is
                            warranted by emergence of this tremendous revulsion against Soviet
                            domination.</p>

                            that the Department was completely out of touch with our Legation in

                                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> for an explanation of events,
                            Mr. Zador asserted that trouble had started after demonstrations by
                            students demanding certain changes in Hungary. He stated that their
                            demands were justified and in response to a question admitted that the
                            students had been joined by trade union groups. Mr. Zador would not
                            accept Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>’s suggestion
                            that there was widespread support for the demonstrators, insisting that
                            the students had been taken advantage of and exploited by “extreme right
                            wing” and “fascist” elements, who took over the demonstrations and
                            caused the disorders. When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                                >Murphy</persName> expressed the view that a movement as widespread
                            as the one reported from Hungary must have leaders, Mr. Zador said that
                            he did not know who the leaders were, that there was no genuine
                            opposition to the Hungarian government. He then went into a rather
                            rambling harangue of Hungary’s sufferings under the fight against
                            “fascist” leadership during the period 1919–1945. He reminded that many
                            of the “fascist” leaders had been executed in 1945 and that others had
                            fled the country. Therefore, there were no real leaders in the group
                            rioting against the government.</p>
                        <p>In response to an inquiry from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                                >Murphy</persName>, he was unable to offer a definition for the word
                            “fascist” which he had used so frequently.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> asked about reports of
                            Soviet troops being engaged in putting down the demonstrations and asked
                            whether the Hungarian people might not be resenting military action
                            against them on the part of foreign troops. Mr. Zador said that he was
                            sure the Soviet troops had not opened fire until they were attacked by
                            the demonstrators. He sought to minimize the extent of Soviet
                            intervention and said that he believed the Soviets had only three
                            divisions in Hungary. Most of the action was being undertaken by the
                            Hungarian army and police. Anyway, he said, the Soviet troops were
                            acting at the request of the Hungarian government under the provisions
                            of the Warsaw Pact, and their participation in the fighting was entirely
                            legal. Despite persistent questioning on the part of Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>, Mr. Zador could not be brought
                            to acknowledge any personal feeling over the shooting down of Hungarian
                            subjects by Soviet troops.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> emphasized that both
                            the American government and people had every sympathy for the Hungarian
                            people and that there was much concern in this country over reports of
                            bloodshed. He stressed the desire of the American government and people
                            to send aid in the form of medical supplies and other relief materials
                            and said that the American Red Cross had been in touch with the
                            International Red <pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0345"/>Cross at
                            Geneva on this matter. He said that our information as of today
                            indicated that 15 national Red Cross societies had been in touch with
                            Geneva, and the International Red Cross had so far not been able to
                            reach the Hungarian Red Cross either by telephone, telegraph or radio,
                            and we were thus unable to determine whether the Hungarian Red Cross
                            needed assistance or was willing to accept it. It was our understanding
                            that the Soviet Red Cross had not made any offer of assistance as yet,
                            although there would be a meeting in Geneva soon with Soviet
                            participation, and we would hope to find out their attitude at that
                            time.</p>
                        <p>In closing the conversation, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                                >Murphy</persName> stated that he wanted to protest on behalf of the
                            United States government the lack of communications facilities in
                            Budapest. We were unable to confirm many of the conflicting reports
                            coming out of Hungary or to ascertain with any degree of accuracy the
                            situation with respect to American citizens in Hungary. He wanted the
                            Hungarian government to understand that the United States government
                            protested this situation. Mr. Zador took note of the protest and made
                            his departure.</p>

                        <p>[Here follows discussion of other subjects.]</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Captive Nations</hi></p>
                        <p>Another intensive concern of our foreign policy is in relation to the
                            captive nations of the world. We had looked upon World War II as a war
                            of liberation. The Atlantic Charter and the United Nations Declaration
                            committed all the Allies to restore sovereign rights and self-government
                            to those who had been forcibly deprived of them and to recognize the
                            right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they
                            would live. Unhappily, those pledges have been violated, and in Eastern
                            Europe one form of conquest was merely replaced by another.</p>
                        <p>But the spirit of patriotism, and the longing of individuals for freedom
                            of thought and of conscience and the right to mold their own lives, are
                            forces which erode and finally break the iron bonds of servitude.</p>
                        <p>Today we see dramatic evidence of this truth. The Polish people now
                            loosen the Soviet grip upon the land they love. And the heroic people of
                            Hungary challenge the murderous fire of Red Army tanks. These patriots
                            value liberty more than life itself. And all who peacefully enjoy
                            liberty have a solemn duty to seek, by all truly helpful means, that
                            those who now die for freedom will not have died in vain. It is in this
                            spirit that the United States and others have today acted to bring the
                            situation in Hungary to the United Nations Security Council.</p>
                        <p>The weakness of Soviet imperialism is being made manifest. Its weakness
                            is not military weakness nor lack of material power. It is weak because
                            it seeks to sustain an unnatural tyranny by suppressing human
                            aspirations which cannot indefinitely be suppressed and by concealing
                            truths which cannot indefinitely be hidden.</p>
                        <p>Imperialist dictatorships often present a formidable exterior. For a time
                            they may seem to be hard, glittering, and irresistible. But in reality
                            they turn out to be “like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear
                            beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men’s bones, and of all
                            uncleanness.” They have vulnerabilities not easily seen.</p>
                        <p>Our Nation has from its beginning stimulated political independence and

                            gave “liberty not alone to the people of this country, but hope to all
                            the world, for all future time.” <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0348"
                            />During the period when our Nation was founded, the tides of despotism
                            were running high. But our free society and its good fruits became known
                            throughout the world and helped to inspire the subject peoples of that
                            day to demand, and to get, the opportunity to mold their own
                            destinies.</p>
                        <p>Today our Nation continues its historic role. The captive peoples should
                            never have reason to doubt that they have in us a sincere and dedicated
                            friend who share their aspirations. They must know that they can draw
                            upon our abundance to tide themselves over the period of economic
                            adjustment which is inevitable as they rededicate their productive
                            efforts to the service of their own people, rather than of exploiting
                            masters. Nor do we condition economic ties between us upon the adoption
                            by these countries of any particular form of society.</p>
                        <p>And let me make this clear, beyond a possiblity of doubt: The United
                            States has no ulterior purpose in desiring the independence of the
                            satellite countries. Our unadulterated wish is that these peoples, from
                            whom so much of our own national life derives, should have sovereignty
                            restored to them and that they should have governments of their own free
                            choosing. We do not look upon these nations as potential military
                            allies. We see them as friends and as part of a new and friendly and no
                            longer divided Europe. We are confident that their independence, if
                            promptly accorded, will contribute immensely to stabilize peace
                            throughout all of Europe, West and East.</p>

                        <p>Let me add a word about future relations with the peoples who compose the
                            Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. They, too, can have hope. The
                            spread of education and industrial development create growing demands
                            for greater intellectual and spiritual freedom, for greater personal
                            security through the protection of law, and for greater enjoyment of the
                            good things of life. And there has been some response to those
                            demands.</p>
                        <p>There is ground to believe that that trend will prove to be an
                            irreversible trend. It may bring the day when the people of the United
                            States can have, with the people of Russia, the relations of fellowship
                            which they would like and when the Governments of our countries can deal
                            with each other as friends.</p>

                        <p>916. We are encountering among our Austrian friends a strong tendency to
                            blame the U.S. for the present predicament of the Hungarian patriots.

                            be referred to Washington for final determination. Legation telegram 169
                            gives circumstances of one contact between State’s representatives,
                            insurgent forces and American personnel. In brief, insurgents were
                            trying to contact Legation to urge that Legation act as mediator between
                            various insurgent groups and government.</p>
                        <p>In view of analysis underlying recommendations in Legation telegram 168,
                            was felt that some action, even if only exploratory and of course
                            unofficial, should be taken to indicate probability that Legation would
                            do whatever practical to facilitate cessation of bloodshed <pb n="320"
                                xml:id="pg_320" facs="0350"/>through compromise between insurgents
                            and government, both for humanitarian reasons and also because it
                            appeared to support US government interests.</p>
                        <p>An aide-mémoire was drafted along such lines to be held in reserve and
                            telephone connections finally made with Deputy Foreign Minister.
                            Following request for assistance in communicating with Washington, which
                            granted only to extent of accepting one clear message over phone (down
                            due to “technical difficulties” and dangers of being on streets), remark
                            was made along lines that: bloodshed regrettable, ceasefire seemed
                            desirable, and speaking purely unofficially we would assume that any
                            Foreign Legation, including this one, would be glad do whatever
                            practical to assist in ending carnage. Response that thought appreciated
                            but hardly likely anything could be done since “gangs” being wiped up,
                            made it clear that Communist new government (or at least this
                            representative thereof) had no thoughts at moment of any deal with
                            insurgents.</p>
                        <p>It now appears certain Soviets moving in troops based in other satellite
                            areas perhaps Soviet Union itself. Thus likely they can by progressive
                            use of force maintain control of Pest, get control of Buda, and clear up
                            provinces. However mounting wave of pro-Hungarian felling in west makes
                            it possible Soviets also might be willing extricate themselves from
                            present situation through an armistice followed by negotiations.</p>

                                    to strengthen his ties with the West and separate himself more
                                    distinctly from the Communists. If he has any such feeling, of
                                    course, we would want to nurture and promote it. Incidentally,
                                    we should be anxious, also, to find him some face-saving
                                    device.</p>

                                    had to suffer at the hands of Russian imperialism and so forth,
                                    and without asking him to do anything except to counsel with us,
                                    we might make some advances in this direction.” (<persName

                            Nehru must have some feelings that perhaps he ought to strengthen his
                            ties with the West, if some face-saving device could be found by which
                            he could do so. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had been
                            thinking along same lines, and had dictated on plane coming back from
                            Dallas something (directed toward the Soviets) of the same nature.</p>
                        <p>The President said that they might be willing to talk sense now more than
                            at any time since Administration has been in power. Said approach might
                            be that things are not going the way any of us want, better have a
                            meeting that recognizes these points.</p>
                        <p>At this point President questioned <persName corresp="#p_SDT1"

                                >Dulles</persName> said he was pretty far down in the Soviet

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that undoubtedly there
                            was a battle on in the Presidium—some of the people probably would want
                            to go back to the old Stalinistic policies—but <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said, that was now too late. He
                            said <pb n="322" xml:id="pg_322" facs="0352"/>they were “up against a
                            tough problem.” The President agreed, and said we had to take advantage
                            of that. Now is the time to talk (more) about reducing tensions in the
                            world. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> agreed, but said we
                            would have to be very careful not to do anything that would look to the
                            satellite world as though we were selling them out.</p>
                        <p>The President of course agreed, said nothing could be done until present
                            thing had settled down, but went back to Nehru and said that he might
                            now be thinking about Soviet colonialism and imperialism in slightly
                            different terms.</p>
                        <p>The President was leaving on political trip to Miami, Jacksonville and
                            Richmond, and said that the Secretary could reach him within a matter of
                            minutes at any time.</p>

                                met with Ambassador Karl Gruber the day before to inform him of the
                                steps the United States was contemplating concerning <gloss

                                situation on that occasion. (Memorandum of conversation by <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName>, October 28; <hi
                                    rend="italic">ibid</hi>., 764.00/10–2856)</note> He said that
                            the policy of his Government was to give asylum to anyone entering
                            Austria from Hungary providing they surrender their arms. This applies
                            whether they come over individually or in large units. At the present
                            time the flow of refugees is not significant but may quickly become so
                            in the event of a decisive development.</p>
                        <p>While Austria is concerned with the economic burden of this policy, they
                            are even more concerned with the potential political difficulties. They
                            therefore are appealing to us to give immediate consideration,
                            presumably in concert with other Western Nations, to the possibilities
                            of moving Hungarian refugees out of Austria to some other location at an
                            early date if the flow becomes significant. Otherwise Austria will be
                            placed in a most difficult position as a neutral country in its
                            relations with the East.</p>
                        <p>In answer to my inquiry as to what precise form of activity he had in
                            mind, whether for instance <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action was
                            contemplated, he said this was not clearly formulated in the Austrian
                            mind and possibly it would be an action that could be taken by <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. They visualized that possibly a
                            group of Western countries would each agree to take a fixed percentage
                            of new refugees. He pointed out that these people had shown the
                            independence and aggressiveness to take part in the uprising. They would
                            constitute a particularly desirable group for any country to take.
                            Besides relieving Austria of the problem it would be most important
                            psychologically to the West that this group not remain couped up under
                            unsatisfactory conditions in Austria for a long period of time. This
                            would provide an additional discouragement to anyone to make a future
                            show of independence. I inquired how the Austrians planned to handle the
                            people they took in. Ambassador Gruber said he would advise his
                            Government not to place them in concentration camps, but to give them as
                            much liberty as possible. However, he did not know whether it would be
                            possible to do this. This was a problem that would have to be worked
                            out.</p>
                        <p>There was also a brief discussion about the advisability of accepting any
                            Communists that might come over as a result of developments and we both
                            agreed that the policy would be to take anyone that came over.</p>
                        <p>I assured the Ambassador that this would be brought to your attention and
                            that it would receive our urgent consideration.</p>

                                    should have sovereignty restored to them, and that they should
                                    have governments of their own free choosing. We do not look upon
                                    these nations as potential military allies. We see them as
                                    friends and as part of a new and friendly and no longer divided

                        <p>177. Current situation completely abnormal if factual situation correctly
                            understood. This is as follows: Soviets have Budapest under control with
                            three Soviet mechanized divisions, although there are a few hard core
                            resistance centers still in city proper. Soviet units at moment sitting
                            in concentrations various key areas and blocking bridges. Appear in
                            defensive posture. Still, Soviet troops estimated in country present
                            moment sufficient to put down nationalists if their policy decided upon.
                            Major question lies in what now acts as restraining influence from
                            exercise this option.</p>
                        <p>One guess might be evenly divided influence at moment between Soviet
                            political thinkers who favor iron fist action and those for moderate
                            course. If this is good guess and west reaction weak-kneed in this
                            crisis would appear scale would tip in favor iron fist school. Legation
                            would recommend pressure on Soviets to be heavy and in any possible form
                            that appears compatible with Washington assessment of risks.<note n="2"

                                suggested one hour later in telegram 180 that the statements of the
                                Nagy government concerning the withdrawal of Soviet troops needed to
                                be weighed most carefully. The Legation further advised that the
                                nationalists required some high-level Western assistance for their
                                cause to survive. To enhance their bargaining position and fighting
                                potential, they required negotiating assistance and military

                        <p>On October 29, Israel invaded the Sinai with the announced intention of
                            destroying Egyptian “Fedayeen” bases. Paratroopers were dropped at the
                            Mitla Pass some 20 miles east of Suez. This provided justification for
                            France and the United Kingdom, who had colluded with Israel in this
                            matter, to issue an ultimatum on October 30 to both Israel and Egypt to
                            withdraw their forces 10 miles from the Suez Canal and to agree to
                            temporary Anglo-French occupation of the Canal sites. Israel, as
                            predetermined, promised compliance, but Egypt refused to <pb n="330"
                                xml:id="pg_330" facs="0360"/>accede. This led to the British bombing
                            of the Egyptian Air Force on October 31 followed on November 6 by the
                            Anglo-French invasion of Port Said. Great Britain and France also used
                            their veto power in the Security Council to defeat United
                            States-sponsored resolutions critical of Israel. The Suez crisis and the
                            involvement of Great Britain and France quickly overshadowed the
                            Hungarian rebellion and became the principal area of concern for United
                            States leaders. Extensive documentation on the Suez crisis is in volume

                        <p>1. Events in Poland and Hungary have demonstrated the strengh and
                            vitality of anti-Soviet sentiments in these Satellites. Particularly in
                            Hungary, there have been manifestations of strong anti-Communist
                            sentiment as well. The Soviet strategic position in Eastern Europe has
                            been weakened. Soviet policy is now confronted with serious dilemmas:
                            (a) the need to make some accommodation with the increasing pressures of
                            nationalism in the Satellites without losing the essential minimum of
                            control over them; (b) the difficulty of using Soviet armed might to put
                            down nationalist and anti-Communist revolt in the face of world
                            opinion.</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Poland</hi></p>
                        <p>2. A new Communist regime, considerably more independent of Moscow than
                            the previous one, has been established in Poland, with reluctant Soviet
                            acquiescence. This regime is pledged to maintain the alliance with the
                            USSR, including the retention of Soviet forces in Poland as long as
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces remain in Germany, but
                            reserving the right to choose whether or not Soviet specialists and
                            military advisors will remain in the Polish army. It is also pledged to
                            introduce certain democratic procedures (presumably compatible with
                            party control), to stop coercive collectivization, and to raise
                            standards of living.</p>

                            regime rests on its ability to strike a balance between popular Polish
                            aspirations for independence and economic improvement, on the one hand,
                            and the minimum requirements of the USSR with respect both to the
                            maintenance of the Communist system and to Soviet military security, on
                            the other. Developments in Hungary may make a middle road course

                            intensify rather than satisfy the pressures for change. The regime of
                            the Communist <persName>Imre Nagy</persName>, once purged from the party
                            for deviationism and only recently restored to party membership, took
                            over with the outbreak of open revolt and the employment of Soviet
                            forces. Nagy promised drastic reforms and announced a government which
                            included non-Communists. The Hungarian army does not appear to have been
                            employed on a large scale, and its allegiance in the struggle is
                            unclear. There have been widespread desertions to the rebels,
                            particularly in the west, and the rebels are in possession of some tanks
                            in other areas; but at least elements of two Hungarian divisions are
                            known to have participated in the repression at the outset.</p>
                        <p>5. It is unlikely that any Hungarian government will be able to reach a
                            compromise between Soviet security requirements and Hungarian
                            nationalist sentiment. Certain rebel groups appear willing to accept
                            Nagy temporarily and it seems possible that he can gradually establish
                            control if he can reach an accommodation with the rebels with respect to
                            their principal demands: abolition of the secret police, complete
                            withdrawal of Soviet troops from the country, and changes in the
                            composition of the government. If the rebels refuse to make an
                            accommodation with Nagy, the Soviet Union will be faced with the
                            alternatives of risking the development of a non-Communist and
                            independent Hungary or of intervening with large scale military forces
                            to take over the country by force.</p>

                        <p>6. Signs of nationalistic ferment were seen during the spring in
                            Czechoslovakia. Beginning late last year, a number of non-Communist
                            politicians were released from prison in Czechoslovakia, Rumania, and
                            Bulgaria; in the spring a number of prominent Stalin purge victims in
                            Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia were cleared of Titoist charges;<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d137fn3">The Second Congress of the Union of Czechoslovak
                                Writers, meeting on April 23, demanded the release of writers who
                                had been unjustly arrested and protested against Party pressure to
                                adhere to the official line. Agitation by Czech students reached its
                                climax in a mass demonstration on May 20, during which the secondary
                                and higher education systems were criticized, a reliable press was
                                called for, the free importation of books and newspapers was
                                advocated, and the trial of those who had extorted false confessions
                                was insisted upon. A Special Committee on Socialist Legality had
                                already been established within the Party Central Committee to
                                investigate the 1952–1954 trials. This culminated in the exoneration
                                of Vilém Nový, Artur London, Laco Novomeský, and Evžen Löbel who had
                                been jailed as alleged “Titoists”. Alexei ČepiČka, Deputy Prime
                                Minister and Minister of Defense and the person whom the Party
                                leadership chose to identify as being most responsible for the
                                purges, was himself forced out of power. Meanwhile, in Bulgaria,
                                Prime Minister Vulko Chervenkov was compelled to resign in April
                                1956 and accept a lesser position while executed Party leader,
                                Traicho Kostov, was posthumously rehabilitated and those of his
                                associates who were still in jail were released.</note> and
                            conciliatory personnel changes were made, particularly in the Czech
                            defense ministry and the Rumanian police apparatus. But there have been
                            no challenges to Soviet influence by the governments of those
                            Satellites, and few indications of sharp divisions within the local
                            parties. However, in the absence of a Soviet return to a policy of
                            repression, a more autonomous and nationally-oriented regime will
                            probably be evolved for Czechoslovakia and possibly Rumania and
                            Bulgaria. This likelihood would be increased if the Hungarian rebels win
                            most of their demands. Albania, on the other hand, is less likely to
                            press vigorously for independence.</p>
                        <p>7. East Germany is a special case. Regardless of East German desires, the
                            USSR will almost certainly not tolerate any substantial weakening of
                            controls or the introduction of effective nationalist influence into the
                            government. The USSR regards East Germany as vitally important to Soviet
                            security and maintains a garrison of 22 line divisions there. Moreover,
                            fear among the Poles and Czechs of a reunified Germany with irredentist
                            claims is a factor serving to persuade them of the need to cooperate
                            with the USSR and to prevent them from supporting an East German
                            independence movement.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Economic Considerations</hi></p>
                        <p>8. Longstanding economic grievances continue to be an important factor
                            behind unrest in the Satellites. Reduced use of repressive measures and
                            an increased candor in discussing economic problems have <pb n="333"
                                xml:id="pg_333" facs="0363"/>recently encouraged more overt
                            expression of discontent. In an effort to alleviate the situation, the
                            USSR has recently negotiated modest aid agreements with Poland, Hungary,
                            East Germany, and Bulgaria.</p>
                        <p>9. The Polish and Hungarian governments will almost certainly attempt to
                            lessen their economic dependence on the USSR, by increasing trade with
                            the West, and probably also by seeking economic assistance, especially
                            in the form of credits.</p>
                        <p>10. The most serious immediate problem for East Europe may be the fuel
                            shortage which will probably result from underfulfillments in the
                            Polish, Czech, and Hungarian coal industries. A severe winter would
                            increase fuel demands and might freeze up East German open pit
                            operations, causing serious shortages which the USSR, with its own coal
                            difficulties, might not be able to alleviate. The bumper Soviet harvest
                            could compensate for the poor Satellite crop of this fall and assure
                            food supplies.</p>
                        <p rend="center">II. Implications for Soviet Policy</p>
                        <p>11. We believe that the Hungarian rebellion came as a surprise to the
                            Soviet leadership. On the basis of the evidence presently available,
                            Soviet policy through the Polish and Hungarian crises appears to have
                            been vacillating. It is too early to be confident on this matter, but we
                            believe that Soviet leadership may be in a state of confusion, and until
                            basic decisions are made, may be unable to conduct policy with sureness
                            of touch. A crisis in Western relationships over the Middle East might
                            make Soviet leaders feel that they had greater freedom of action in the
                            Satellite area.</p>
                        <p>12. There has for some time been difference of opinion among Soviet
                            leaders about the post-Stalin policy of seeking to reduce apathy at
                            home, disaffection in the Satellites, and distrust in the non-Communist
                            world. Soviet confidence in this policy, generated by gains in morale at
                            home and an improved position in international relations, must now have
                            been shaken by the need to make concessions in Poland and especially by
                            the events in Hungary. It is possible that the Hungarian rebellion will
                            precipitate changes in the composition or structure of the Soviet
                            leadership. If the Hungarian rebels are able to achieve a substantial
                            political victory, pressures for policy changes will almost certainly
                            make the position of the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> leadership increasingly difficult. The
                            position of advocates of a harder line may be strengthened. Changes in
                            the leadership would be even more likely if the professional military
                            under <persName corresp="#p_ZMGK1">Zhukov</persName> insist that basic
                            Soviet security is being jeopardized by current policies.</p>
                        <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0364"/>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Domestic and Foreign Policy</hi></p>
                        <p>13. Irrespective of any action which Soviet leaders may feel forced to
                            take in Hungary, it is unlikely that they will wish drastically to
                            reverse the course of domestic relaxation which was undertaken largely
                            for pressing internal considerations and has significantly improved
                            party and popular morale. It is also unlikely that Soviet leaders will
                            abandon the effort to woo the uncommitted areas of the world and to
                            weaken Western alliances. Soviet armed action in the Hungarian crisis
                            will have an adverse effect on the credibility of the USSR’s propaganda
                            exploitation of anticolonial movements, but the ultimate effect in this
                            area, as well as on the attitudes of the Yugoslav and Chinese Communist
                            promoters of Satellite autonomy, will be determined more by future
                            Soviet policy than by the present emergency action.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Policy Toward the Satellites</hi></p>
                        <p>14. Evidence at present does not permit an estimate of whether or not the
                            USSR will occupy Hungary with additional military force sufficient to
                            quell the rebellion, in the event that present measures to establish
                            control are unsuccessful. Unless it does so, however, we believe it
                            unlikely that the USSR would find it feasible to impose for any long
                            period a Stalinist system of rigid police and ideological controls over
                            the Satellites. For the present, the USSR will probably endeavor to
                            prevent further outbreaks in the Satellites by insisting on
                            precautionary police measures and the suppression of anti-Soviet
                            ferment. These closer controls will probably be accompanied by
                            ameliorating measures such as Soviet help in meeting food shortages,
                            moratoria on collectivization, and relief from some other economic
                            pressures. East Germany will be watched with particular vigilance.</p>
                        <p>15. If confronted by strong nationalist pressures in the other
                            Satellites, the USSR will probably attempt to establish Communist
                            regimes which possess a larger measure of internal autonomy but which
                            maintain military and foreign policy solidarity with the USSR.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Military Implications</hi></p>
                        <p>16. We believe the Soviet leaders estimate that the minimum military
                            requirements for their national security include the maintenance of
                            effective early warning capabilities on the Satellite borders, of
                            powerful Soviet forces in East Germany, and of secure lines of
                            communication from the USSR to East Germany. The developments in Poland
                            and Hungary will probably result in a substantial downward revision in
                            the Soviet estimate of the reliability of most of the Satellite <pb
                                n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0365"/>armed forces.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d137fn4">See Annex. [Footnote in the source text. The annex
                                is not printed.]</note> We believe these circumstances will dictate
                            a keen Soviet desire to retain its own military forces in the other
                            Satellites in which they are now stationed, especially in Poland. For
                            the immediate future, the possibility of new Satellite rebellions will
                            reinforce this desire. Therefore, the Soviet leaders will almost
                            certainly retain the Warsaw Pact organization in order to preserve the
                            rights which they enjoy under it.</p>
                        <p>17. It seems unlikely that US action short of overt military intervention
                            or obvious preparation for such intervention would lead the USSR
                            deliberately to take steps which it believed would materially increase
                            the risk of general war. The Soviet leaders probably recognize that the
                            US nuclear-air capability remains superior to that of the USSR, and have
                            probably concluded that at present the USSR, even if it launched a
                            surprise attack, would receive unacceptable damage in a nuclear exchange
                            with the US.</p>
                        <p>18. Soviet suspicions of US policy and present circumstances which
                            involve Soviet troop movements and alerts probably increase the
                            likelihood of a series of actions and counteractions leading
                            inadvertently to war. Such a series of actions could most readily
                            originate with respect to East Germany.</p>

                            Zils going into Kremlin, and Soviet Government presumably has reached
                            decision on handling Hungarian matter. Certain points of interest on
                            other subjects which emerged these conversations will be reported
                            separately, but only extended conversation I had on subject Hungary was
                            with <persName corresp="#p_ZMGK1">Marshal Zhukov</persName> who also
                            sought me out at Turks.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ZMGK1">Zhukov</persName> stuck straight to party
                            line and as will be seen from observations made to me on Hungarian
                            situation was indulging in mixture untruths, half-truths and possibly
                            some elements of real fact. I asked <persName corresp="#p_ZMGK1"
                                >Zhukov</persName> whether Nagy broadcast of the night before which
                            stated Soviet troops would be leaving Budapest immediately and that
                            negotiations for the total withdrawal from Hungary would be
                                undertaken<note n="3" xml:id="d138fn3">See <ref target="#d132fn3"

                            agreement with Soviet Government, and if this represented Soviet
                            intention in regard to troop withdrawal. <persName corresp="#p_ZMGK1"
                                >Zhukov</persName> replied Nagy broadcast had not referred to
                            immediate withdrawal from Budapest and that Soviet troops having gone
                            there at request Hungarian Government would remain until that government
                            requested withdrawal or until “order had been restored”. On general
                            withdrawal he said this was matter consideration members Warsaw Pact,
                            repeating to me privately what he said earlier to press.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ZMGK1">Zhukov</persName> then made following

                                    information to contrary on this point and that Soviet

                                <item>He said Soviet troops had only opened fire when some of their

                                    forty-eight hours there had been no firing by Soviet troops. I
                                    again told him I had information to the contrary which he stated
                                    was false. (<gloss target="#t_BBC1">BBC</gloss> this morning

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ZMGK1">Zhukov</persName> attempted to take
                            “soldier’s” attitude in defense Soviet troops, stating that he was not a
                            politician and that function of army [soldier] was to carry out orders
                            given to him. In addition he attempted along standard lines to present
                            Hungarian action as counter-revolutionary putsch and when help was asked
                            for by government member Warsaw Pact, Soviets could not refuse. He
                            inquired what would happen under any alliance in similar circumstances
                            to which I replied <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> contained no
                            provision for use foreign troops for intervention internal matters, to
                            which he replied Warsaw Pact was for support Socialist camp and,
                            therefore, for protection Socialist governments from any threat. In
                            answer to my comment that I knew nothing in text Warsaw Pact which would
                            justify internal intervention, <persName corresp="#p_ZMGK1"
                                >Zhukov</persName> said such action was “envisaged” in pact.</p>
                        <p>He attempted, though somewhat mildly, to stress “foreign connection” of
                            insurgents mentioning that they have captured large quantities of
                            American rifles, as well as German cannon. He did not, however, assert
                            that these alleged American arms had been sent by US but said they were
                            probably World War II supplies smuggled into Hungary from Austria.</p>
                        <p>He said he regretted action three Western powers bringing matter before
                            Security Council since it was internal affair Hungary. I immediately
                            challenged him on this and said he could hardly expect otherwise since
                            intervention Soviet troops gave it strong international aspect. He made
                            no answer.</p>
                        <p>In course conversation I asked him if it was not simple fact that when a
                            government was forced to appeal foreign troops for help this was
                            clearest evidence that government did not enjoy support people.
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZMGK1">Zhukov</persName> in feeble reply spoke
                            of exploitation legitimate discontent for past policies by unscrupulous
                            and criminal elements, which is standard Soviet line.</p>
                        <p>With reference to future Soviet policy, <persName corresp="#p_ZMGK1"
                                >Zhukov</persName> did not go beyond statement that troops would be
                            withdrawn from Budapest immediately when Hungarian Government so
                            requested or when cease fire became operative. (<persName

                            troops would remain Budapest until rebels had laid down their arms.)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ZMGK1">Zhukov</persName> made number interesting
                            observations in regard to Polish situation in discussing Hungarian
                            events. He cited as proof Soviet unwillingness intervene internal
                            affairs fact no troops were used Poland, although he said there was more
                            than ample force in East Germany, White Russia and Poland itself for
                            this purpose. He became quite vehement at this point and said “they”
                            could have crushed them like flies. When I asked him who “they” were he
                            made no direct reply, saying that Soviets had shown great restraint in
                            Poland. He said in fact <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0368"/>in
                            order to ensure that troops in East Germany did not move Poland he had
                            purposely sent Konev there to make sure forces remained on spot. This is
                            confirmation of what was suspected before that actual use of force in
                            Poland was most seriously considered by Soviet Government and may
                            indicate army had urged action in Poland.</p>
                        <p>I have no way of judging truth <persName corresp="#p_ZMGK1"
                                >Zhukov</persName>’s remarks that Soviet troops have confined action
                            to Budapest and had by-passed towns, other areas Hungary where
                            nationalists were in control. However, from general tenor his remarks,
                            as well as statements to press by <persName corresp="#p_SDT1"
                                >Shepilov</persName> and him, it looks as though Soviet decision was
                            to support Nagy government to end, although possibly primarily in
                            Budapest leaving provinces and other towns for subsequent mopping up if
                            resistance can be broken in capital, thereby hoping to avoid total
                            military occupation Hungary by Soviet forces. In this light it would
                            appear Nagy’s statements on night of 28th regarding Soviet troop
                            withdrawal from Budapest was nothing more than trick, with Soviet
                            connivance, to cause insurgents to cease fire.</p>
                        <p>Since in all probability I will see <persName corresp="#p_ZMGK1"
                                >Zhukov</persName> this evening Kremlin reception, would appreciate

                            was determined this is not time for increasing prestige present Rumanian
                            regime and permitting enlargement its activity US. As you aware we did
                            not enter talks as suppliant. Meetings were proposed by Rumanians and we
                            merely enlarged scope to permit discussion some topics of interest US.

                        <p>188. Politically, Hungarian situation now seems be in stalemate.
                            Nationalists, bulk of whom anti-commie and anti-Soviet, have by their
                            past week’s resistance managed to achieve political strength at least
                            equal to that built up here during past decade by hard core communists
                            and Soviets. But military situation so unequal or potentially unequal
                            that over-all result can best be described as highly unstable stalemate
                            which could very well result in application iron fist by Soviets.

                            guarantee withdrawal Soviet troops. As Legation sees it, nationalists

                            international guarantee of withdrawal Soviet troops in some stipulated
                            period of time. Soviets conceivably, altho admittedly much less likely,
                                <pb n="341" xml:id="pg_341" facs="0371"/>might be willing consent to

                            anti-Soviet.</p>
                        <p>New Hungarian Government would have to give Soviets and communists some
                            assurance that they have chance for survival here. This problem most
                            ticklish, for it is obvious Hungary currently has few political men of
                            leadership capacity, not to speak of specialized types, who might be
                            acceptable both sides. If such leaders found, country would be in
                            situation similar to that experienced prior World War I, when population
                            split between those loyal to revolutionary principles of 1848 and to
                            compromise principles of 1867, but worked together peacefully
                            nonetheless.</p>
                        <p>Despite fact that as matters now stand Nagy’s chance of forming rallying
                            point for Hungarians and bridge for Soviets seem be decreasing daily, an
                            international agreement on Soviet troop withdrawal might again restore
                            Nagy’s rallying capacity and also allow him remain acceptable to
                            Soviets.</p>

                        <p>At 2:28 p.m. on October 30, Nagy announced to the Hungarian people the
                            abolition of one-party rule and the restoration of those parties which
                            had participated in the democratic coalition of 1945. These included the
                            Smallholder Party, the Social Democrats, and the National Peasant Party
                            in addition to the Communists. An inner Cabinet was created, consisting
                            of Nagy, <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kádár</persName>, and Géza Losonczy
                            of the Communists, Tildy and Kovács of the Smallholders, and Ferenc
                            Erdei of the National Peasant Party, with one place reserved for the
                            Social Democrats. This last position went to Anna Kéthly. Nagy indicated
                            that he hoped shortly to begin negotiations for the withdrawal of all
                            Soviet troops from Hungary and he appealed to the Soviets to initiate
                            the removal of their military forces from Budapest. The text of this

                            Suslov, who returned to Budapest on October 30 to assess the situation
                            and to confer with Hungarian Party leaders, concurred in these moves as
                            necessary to maintain Communist control of the situation. The Soviet

                            “difficulties, unsolved problems, and out-and-out mistakes, including
                            some in the relations between socialist states—violations and mistakes

                        <p>In respect to Hungary, the Declaration reads: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Soviet Government and all the Soviet people deeply regret
                                    that the development of events in Hungary has led to bloodshed.
                                    On the request of the Hungarian People’s Government the Soviet
                                    Government consented to the entry into Budapest of the Soviet
                                    Army units to assist the Hungarian People’s Army and the
                                    Hungarian authorities to establish order in the town. Believing
                                    that the further presence of Soviet Army units in Hungary can
                                    serve as a cause for even greater deterioration of the
                                    situation, the Soviet Government has given instructions to its
                                    military command to withdraw the Soviet Army units from Budapest
                                    as soon as this is recognized as necessary by the Hungarian
                                    Government.</p>

                                    relevant negotiations with the Government of the Hungarian

                                    of Hungary is at the present moment the chief and sacred duty of
                                    workers, peasants, and intelligentsia, and of all the Hungarian
                                    working people.”</p>

                            “second hand” press commentary. Lib staff, like those of other stations
                            here, has been working round clock since beginning Polish crises 10 days
                            ago; nevertheless, morale obviously at nadir. Staff unanimously feels
                            station has become a “neutral information bureau” at the very time when
                            Iron Curtain events provide first real opportunity justify its raison
                            d’être.</p>
                        <p>This raison d’être, Lib staff feels, demands now more than ever before
                            that station 1) interpolate and comment on news, 2) express its moral
                            support and solidarity with Hungs or others openly opposing Commie rule,
                            3) condemn Sov armed intervention—call on Sov forces desist killing
                            oppressed who have risen, and 4) urge Sov listeners to express their
                            sympathy with satellite peoples in their efforts achieve real
                            freedom.</p>
                        <p>RadioLib instructions received from AmComLib/NY Oct. 28 did, in fact,
                            belatedly provide framework for broadcast commentary on satellite
                            events. However, all such commentary originated in Munich must be filed
                            to AmComLib/NY and approved there prior to use. In <pb n="344"
                                xml:id="pg_344" facs="0374"/>view of fast-moving satellite events,
                            such requirement stultified RadioLib output, in opinion station’s staff,
                            and leaves none of the flexibility so essential in present situation.
                            Furthermore, Lib staff points out, such flexibility is a must if
                            satellite revolt shows signs of spreading. For instance, RadioLib
                            anticipates request from FedRep that it broadcast appeals to Sov troops
                            in <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> not to shoot down Germans there.
                            Station’s hands tied in such an eventuality until AmComLib/NY
                            consulted.</p>
                        <p>The frustration of RadioLib staff is further exacerbated by knowledge
                            that both <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_MRC1">MRC</gloss> allowed use locally-originated
                            commentary and are generally permitted wide local discretion in dealing
                            with events as they occur.</p>
                        <p>RadioLib staff feels strongly that continued muzzle will seriously
                            disillusion station’s audience, could do serious harm to best interests
                            of US as well as Commie dominated peoples.</p>
                        <p>Though RadioLib obviously chafing at the bit, we believe that staff’s
                            frustration confined to ban on broadcasts on lines 4 points enumerated
                            second paragraph above and not thwarted desire air inflammatory
                            broadcasts designed, or capable of interpretation, as provocation open
                            revolution in USSR. Able Amer staff of Lib can certainly keep lid on
                            even if best judgment of émigré staff goes off beam.<note n="3"

                        <p>332. Following is Department’s assessment of recent events in Hungary at
                            present time.</p>
                        <p>Owing to lack of communications with Legation Budapest past few days it
                            has been difficult to follow swift-moving events. Picture at present
                            seems to be that Nagy Government has control of situation in Budapest
                            but that there, as in rest of country, particularly western <pb n="345"
                                xml:id="pg_345" facs="0375"/>portion, insurgents occupy number of
                            important points. Rebels consist of two main orientations—National
                            Communists fighting Soviet troops and opposing government as long as it
                            uses them, and anti-Communists with more sweeping aims in direction of
                            democracy. There is some indication they are drawing closer together on
                            anti-Soviet issues, on coordinating fighting activities, and on
                            demanding broadening of Nagy Government. Leaders not known and
                            countrywide violent reaction appears spontaneous outburst.</p>
                        <p>Dominant issue is use of Soviet troops for brutal repression Hungarian
                            people. After cooperating in inviting them to help restore order and
                            after stressing their presence in Hungary legal under Warsaw Pact, Nagy
                            has reversed position and has promised to have them withdrawn from
                            Budapest, on condition fighting stops, and negotiate their final
                            departure from Hungary. Soviets are justifying use of their troops on
                            grounds that rebellion in Hungary incited by US and stess invitation of
                            Hungarian Government in this regard. Official organ of Hungarian Workers
                            (Communist) Party has categorically rejected this interpretation and
                            attributes uprisings to past policies Hungarian regime.<note n="2"

                            in Communist world.</p>
                        <p>Question whether Soviets willing to allow stabilization under Nagy
                            Government committed to withdrawal their troops (with all that implies
                            for other satellite countries) or whether they must proceed to
                            reestablish complete control over country in role of alien occupier
                            (which implies huge military burden for future and nullifies present
                            world posture).</p>
                        <p>US objective at this stage is primarily to encourage cessation of use of
                            Soviet troops against Hungarian people and establish conditions for
                            their eventual withdrawal from Hungary. Security Council action directed
                            toward these ends. Meanwhile, in view delicate balance with regard Nagy
                            regime and its pledge to rid country of Soviet troops, US is refraining
                            at this point from adopting stand on Nagy. Some evidence however regime
                            attempting deception break resistance. US will aim to hold it to
                            promises.</p>

                        <p>1003. Tonight at Kremlin reception <persName corresp="#p_ZMGK1"
                                >Zhukov</persName> told me flatly Soviet troops had been ordered
                            withdrawn from Budapest. In view importance his statement I give his
                            exact words, “the order has already been given for Soviet forces to
                            leave the city.” He then added with gesture of impatience as if to say
                            let them deal with it themselves.</p>
                        <p>This statement arose from my query to <persName corresp="#p_ZMGK1"
                                >Zhukov</persName> concerning his assertion yesterday (<gloss

                            fire in city. <persName corresp="#p_ZMGK1">Zhukov</persName> denied this
                            completely and then added statement given above concerning withdrawal
                            troops from city. He did not mention anything about withdrawal from
                            country, which yesterday he said privately to me and publicly, was
                            matter for Warsaw Pact consideration.</p>

                            mistrusted completely at first. Crucial point, however, in our belief,
                            was actual beginning of withdrawal of troops from Budapest.</p>
                        <p>During events of past week, Legation was doubtful that what has happened
                            could be achieved without strongest Western support. That it is taking
                            place is additional evidence of tremendous strength of popular movement,
                            which undoubtedly having profound effect on Soviet policy. Appears
                            logical premise that Soviets, having unilaterally decided to abandon
                            military position in city without guarantee of ultimate nature of
                            government that springs up behind, must be seriously considering
                            departure from Hungary within relatively short period.</p>
                        <p>In view attitude Hungarian army, Legation believes public order will be
                            reasonably maintained. Partisan ferreting out of <gloss target="#t_AVH1"
                                >AVH</gloss> units already beginning this morning, however, with
                            some sporadic shooting audible, and will probably go on for some time.
                            Virtually no looting has occurred, as far as Legation is aware, nor has
                            any evidence of anti-Semitic outbursts become known to Legation.</p>
                        <p>Question of political future, of course, much more cloudy. Legation
                            informed that Social Democrats now meeting to choose members coalition
                            group. Also informed by partisan that nothing less than American-type
                            western democracy would satisfy population. Present coalition, in any
                            event, appears as transitional government pending emergence of more
                            permanent political parties. Speed and nature of this process by no
                            means clear as yet.</p>
                        <p>Future US role in Hungary also not clear, but seems certain to be very
                            different from past. Hungarian radio phoned this a.m. for foreign news

                            that would be desirable for President to make statement in very near

                                    will strive genuinely to serve the Polish people.</p>

                                    it appears, a new Hungary is rising from this struggle, a

                                    its relations with all the countries of Eastern Europe. This
                                    statement recognized the need for review of Soviet policies, and
                                    the amendment of these policies to meet the demands of the
                                    people for greater national independence and personal freedom.
                                    The Soviet Union declared its readiness to consider the
                                    withdrawal of Soviet ‘advisers,’ who have been the effective
                                    ruling force in Soviet-occupied countries, and also to consider
                                    withdrawal of Soviet troops from such countries as Poland and
                                    Hungary.</p>

                                <p>“Ana second, if the Soviet Union indeed faithfully acts upon its

                                <p>“We have also, with respect to the Soviet Union, sought clearly

                            Austrian officials and travelers may be helpful: Strength uprising
                            appears be its popular nature. Although US criticized for failure supply
                            any plan or leadership to rebels, this very fact has both weakened
                            Soviet case for intervention and deprived them any specific center which
                            either they or Communist government could capture in effort suppress
                            revolt. Lack of political leadership of patriots however having effect
                            consolidate power of Budapest Government as only effective organization
                            in existence. Many reports here that Communists making great effort
                            infiltrate western liberation committees. West Hungarian patriots appear
                            go further in their demands for full freedom than citizens of capital
                            doubtless because less exposed to Soviet force. Kreisky<note n="2"

                            starve would have salutary effect. For example refusal of miners and

                            advantage.</p>
                        <p>Observers here seem agreed in distrusting Nagy who clearly not even a
                                <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName>, and in considering
                            Tildy hopelessly weak and compromised and Kovacs and Anna Kethly most
                            reliable characters on the scene.</p>
                        <p>Following are my tentative personal views admittedly based on incomplete
                            information of rapidly changing situation. Key points with patriots
                            appear be withdrawal Soviet troops and promise free elections. While
                            both highly important, appears danger patriots will overplay their hand
                            and seems unrealistic expect Soviets commit themselves both to
                            withdrawal and elections which would certainly result in anti-Communist
                            government. If opportunity arises suggest therefore we should
                            concentrate on first objective since if achieved, Hungarians could
                            likely insure evolution to democratic government once Soviet troops
                            removed. On other hand if Soviet troops remain even free elections would
                            provide no permanent security Hungarian freedom. Principal cards western
                            hands appear to be potential influence on patriots to restore order and
                            accept interim government, alternative of threat break relations Nagy
                            government, possible willingness our part accept Hungarian neutrality,
                            and possible willingness give economic aid. Presume Department aware

                            credentials to Nagy government may be exploited as endorsement by US of
                            present government.</p>
                        <p>Reports here indicate western Hungarians intend propose Hungary adopt
                            policy neutrality. Believe Austrians would welcome such decision. If
                            negotiations for commitment to west powers or <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> by Soviets agree withdraw troops should develop, suggest
                            we could agree in advance recognize Hungarian neutrality if this should
                            be decided upon by a freely elected Hungarian Government. In this
                            connection recall that Austrian willingness declare neutrality was key
                            point in their negotiations Moscow.</p>

                            Seen from here their immediate objective is take steam out of revolution
                            and establish government with greatest degree Communist control
                            possible. While clear that Soviets could by force easily and quickly
                            wipe out present opposition in west Hungary our information <pb n="354"
                                xml:id="pg_354" facs="0384"/>indicates that any stooge government

                        <p rend="center">General Considerations</p>
                        <p>1. Events of great magnitude in Poland and Hungary necessitate an
                            appraisal of the situation and consideration of current U.S. policies,
                            objectives, and courses of action toward those countries. Our initial
                            objective toward the Eastern European satellite area has been to
                            encourage, as a first step toward eventual full national independence
                            and freedom, the emergence of “national” communist governments. While
                            these governments might continue to be in close political and military
                            alliance with the Soviet Union, they would be able to exercise to a much
                            greater degree than in the past independent authority and control in the
                            direction of their own affairs, primarily confined in the first stage to
                            their internal affairs.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Poland</hi></p>
                        <p>2. Developments in Poland appear favorable to the early attainment of
                            this objective. The <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName>
                            Government has proclaimed its “national independence and equality” and
                            has asserted its right to pursue its own internal road to “socialism”.
                            At the same time it has <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0385"
                            />declared continued loyalty to its alliance with the USSR and, though
                            requesting the retirement of Soviet armed forces to their usual
                            stations, has declared Soviet troops must remain in Poland and East
                            Germany.</p>
                        <p>3. In Poland, as in Hungary, recent developments have revealed the strong
                            anti-Russian and anti-communist sentiments of the population. Unlike
                            Hungary, the existence of strong leadership in Poland at a critical
                            moment, fear of a reunified Germany with irredentist claims, and the
                            timely promise of reforms, together with an assertion of “national
                            independence” linked with a closely calculated defiance of Russian
                            pressure, evidently has served to enable a reconstituted Polish
                            communist government to set forth on its new course with the
                            acquiescence, if not support, of the majority of Poles.</p>
                        <p>4. The United States has already indicated directly to the new Government
                            that a Polish request for economic assistance, particularly for wheat or
                            other surplus commodities, would be given sympathetic study. Severe
                            legal and administrative limits are imposed on such assistance.<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d151fn2">See Annex B. [Footnote in the source
                                text.]</note> On the other hand, opportunities exist for materially
                            aiding Poland (and possibly Hungary) in the general area of trade with
                            the free world.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Hungary</hi></p>
                        <p>5. Developments in Hungary have differed significantly from those in
                            Poland. In Hungary, a nationalist movement, similar to that in Poland,
                            was triggered into national revolt by the intervention of Soviet troops
                            called in by the Hungarian Government in the first hours of its
                            difficulty. The demands of the people on the government have since gone
                            far beyond those originally sought and are now anti-communist as well as
                            anti-Soviet.</p>
                        <p>6. The situation in Hungary is still fluid and the outcome is difficult
                            to foresee. The Nagy Government, already compromised by the fact of
                            Soviet intervention, is seeking to restore its authority over the
                            country by appearing to accede to many of the demands made upon it.
                            Soviet forces are still in Hungary and the Soviet press has asserted
                            that they are legally there under the terms of the Warsaw Pact. At the
                            request of France, the United Kingdom and the United States, the
                            Hungarian situation has been brought before the <gloss target="#t_UN1"

                        <p rend="center">Policy Conclusions</p>
                        <p>8. In the present situation, the Basic Objectives of <gloss

                            valid. However, in the light of developments in Poland and Hungary,
                            certain tentative conclusions may now be drawn and certain courses of
                            action can be taken to advance U.S. policies and objectives toward the
                            satellite area.</p>
                        <p>9. The participation of Soviet troops at the “invitation” of the
                            Hungarian Government in fighting the Hungarian population, and the near
                            intervention of Soviet forces in Poland, illustrate that, at least in
                            those countries where Soviet troops are stationed, the Soviet Union is
                            willing to use its armed forces to prevent the coming into power of a
                            non-communist government, or to prevent a communist government from
                            altering a policy of close military and political alliance with the
                            USSR.</p>
                        <p>10. Moscow is apparently willing to accept, however reluctantly, a
                            communist government, which, while remaining loyal to its military and

                        <p>11. It seems unlikely that U.S. action short of overt military
                            intervention or obvious preparation for such intervention would lead the
                            USSR deliberately to take steps which it believed would materially
                            increase the risk of general war. Soviet suspicions of U.S. policy and
                            present circumstances which involve Soviet troop movements and alerts
                            probably increase the likelihood of a series of actions and
                            counter-actions leading inadvertently to war.</p>

                        <p>Upon entering the Cabinet Room from his office, the President informed
                            the members of the Council that, except in so far as it was the subject
                            of the DCI’s intelligence briefing, he did not wish the Council to take
                            up the situation in the Soviet satellites. Instead, he wished to
                            concentrate on the Middle East.<note n="2" xml:id="d152fn2">At 8:40

                                meeting, as academic since the situation had largely resolved
                                itself. The President expressed the view that it would be good to

                        <p>The Director of Central Intelligence said that he had a few remarks to
                            make on the situation in Hungary. In a sense, what had occurred there
                            was a miracle. Events had belied all our past views that a popular
                            revolt in the face of modern weapons was an utter impossibility.
                            Nevertheless, the impossible had happened, and because of the power of
                            public opinion, armed force could not effectively be used. Approximately
                            80% of the Hungarian Army had defected to the rebels and provided the
                            rebels with arms. Soviet troops themselves had had no stomach for
                            shooting down Hungarians, except in Budapest.</p>

                            authority to bring the rebels together. Nagy was failing to unite the
                            rebels, and they were demanding that he quit. Somehow a rallying point
                            must be found in order to prevent chaos inside of Hungary even if the
                            Soviets took their leave. In such a heavily Catholic nation as Hungary,

                            seems we cannot get the subject into the General Assembly at the moment
                            because this Special Session was called to consider only the fighting in
                            the Near East. The thinking in State is that it would be better not to
                            have our Hungarian resolution vetoed in the Security Council; however,
                            the regular General Assembly meeting is still twelve days off.<note

                            probably have just as good an effect if brought before the Assembly

                        <p>Schaaf: It would be very dramatic to put up a resolution to the Security

                        <p>Cox: If there is a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution, would it
                            be possible to use an airdrop to supply the Hungarians?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FEL1">Freers</persName>: If a <gloss

                            granted. But a resolution of this kind raises a lot of big
                            questions.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FEL1">Freers</persName>: We are discussing <gloss

                        <gap/>
                        <p>Boerner: The Soviets must have brought enough troops to put down the
                            revolt. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> provides the means to
                            mobilize world opinion.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FEL1">Freers</persName>: We have a question as to
                            whether we give material aid or restrict ourselves to psychological
                            methods through the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and elsewhere. If
                            a decision is given to render assistance, do we give enough to save the
                            situation or just enough to hold the Russians off for a while? It would
                            seem desirable to be drafting a resolution for the General Assembly
                            which would provide the basis for assistance if such a decision is made.
                            What is done right now depends upon the countries in the immediate area,
                            unless their air space is violated.</p>
                        <p>Schaaf: It might not be possible to assist them by air drop without
                            getting the Soviet air force committed against us.</p>
                        <p>Ernst: Since it appears almost certain that we will not be assisting the
                            rebels, we should make an offer of asylum and a major effort to evacuate
                            as many of the rebels as possible as refugees.</p>
                        <p>Compton: The Austrians will grant asylum as they have promised, but we
                            will have to do more to help the refugees out than we are now doing.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FEL1">Freers</persName>: We could offer all
                            necessary economic assistance to the Hungarian people to carry on the
                            struggle.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRO1">Blake</persName>: That would take time.

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CL1">Campbell</persName>: We cannot offer economic
                            aid to existing government in the present situation unless a policy
                            decision is taken.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_REL1">Revey</persName>: It would appear that we
                            cannot take any concrete action within the next 24 hours which is a
                            pretty unfortunate fact.</p>

                        <p>Boerner: As a psychological measure, we might consider assembling all of
                            the Hungarian émigré leaders on the Austrian border. If they do not wish
                            to form a government-in-exile they might serve as a rallying point. . .

                        <p>Stephens: Are we sending propaganda to the Soviet troops in Hungary?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CL1">Campbell</persName>: Radio Free Europe is
                            urging them not to shoot the Hungarians. These programs are in Russian
                            and beamed to the Soviet troops.</p>
                        <p>Boerner: It would appear desirable to slow down on our East-West exchange
                            note negotiations with the USSR.</p>

                            Eastern European satellites by withdrawing advisers, altering its
                            one-sided economic relationships, and giving appearance willingness
                            discuss withdrawal Sov troops where and when such steps necessary
                            appease national feelings these countries and support national Communist
                            regimes there. Declaration, which is logical further development of 20th
                            Party Congress <gloss target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss> endorsement
                            “various roads to socialism”, promised (1) discuss “measures insure
                            further development economic ties”; (2) “examine together with other
                            states question whether further stay Sov advisers (in satellites) is
                            expedient”; (3) “examine with other socialist countries which are
                            participants in Warsaw Treaty questions of Sov troops stationed in those
                            countries.”</p>
                        <p>Sovs appear feel nationalist and anti-Sov feeling has reached danger
                            point where losses must be cut by accepting high degree independence
                            satellites, but within “socialist” framework. Sovs probably hope
                            maintain their influence through (1) national communist leaders’
                            ideological identification with Sovs and their need for ultimate support
                            against anti-communism; (2) growing degree economic integration, even
                            though trade will be on terms more favorable to satellites and Sovs will
                            have to give some economic aid; (3) and, at least in Poland and
                            Czechoslovakia, fear of German resurgence.</p>
                        <p>Hungary may prove test case this policy. Here Sov influence has
                            deteriorated to point where apparently growing number national
                            communists are for moment taking open anti-Sov line in supporting
                            Hungarian Government’s (1) demand for early withdrawal Sov troops, (2)
                            proclamation Hungary’s neutrality and withdrawal from Warsaw Pact, and
                            (3) intention allow major modification collectivized agriculture and
                            holding new general elections. At present not clear whether Sovs feel

                            Hungarian rebellion must be crushed. Sov troops continue control access

                            anti-communist decisions. In using pressure to this end, Soviet Union
                            will have support of Czechoslovakia and Rumania. Poland and Yugoslavia,
                            while both insisting on withdrawal foreign troops, give signs using
                            influence maintain at least communist-dominated Hungarian Government.

                            situation in other satellites are factors still unknown magnitude which
                            may tend influence Sovs postpone<note n="3" xml:id="d157fn3">The word

                            decision.</p>
                        <p>Sovs give every indication continuing accommodate self to Poland’s drive
                            for autonomy on internal matters, on basis Poland’s apparent
                            determination maintain communist-dominated government and “socialist”
                            internal order plus close alliance with Soviet Union. Close
                            identification of Sov-Polish interests in maintaining Sov control in
                            East Germany (and for Poles’ need for long-term support in retaining
                            western territories) probably presage continuing Polish-Sov military
                            cooperation, though on new basis.</p>
                        <p>For number reasons (such as national character of peoples, varying
                            degrees of economic distress, and lack of strong living national
                            communist leaders), Governments of Czechoslovakia, Rumania, Bulgaria,
                            and Albania are in hands of leaders closely identified with “Stalinist”
                            policies in Eastern Europe. Troop issue only present in Rumania, and
                            declaration Sov willingness negotiate for their withdrawal takes off
                            pressure at this point for immediate future. Sovs must now find ways
                            strengthen hand leaders these countries as most pro-Sov leaders they
                            could hope find.</p>
                        <p>East Germany is separate problem. Here every indication is that Sovs will
                            stand on present positions of maintaining in power “Stalinist”-East
                            German regime by 400,000 man Sov occupation force. Sovs appear continue
                            regard their ability block German reunification as their trump card, and
                            they are apparently willing defend with force their East German
                            position. Absence national communist leaders of stature, “wait and see”
                            attitude East German people, and increased <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> internal security measures are factors tending
                            stabilize conditions there for present. Appears likely Sovs recognize
                            magnitude seriousness pressures created by recent developments in
                            Hungary and particularly Poland will have on their East German
                            position.</p>

                                proposed that the first stage consist of speeches against the
                                Soviets and the introduction of a procedural resolution to suspend
                                Council deliberations for 48 hours to allow time for the conclusion
                                of negotiations for the withdrawal of all Soviet forces from
                                Hungary. The second stage was to involve a substantive resolution,
                                the full nature of which had not yet been determined. The likelihood
                                of the substantive resolution was to be made known, but not the
                                possibility of the procedural maneuver. (<hi rend="italic"

                            be devised, or else return to open use of force and in effect military
                            occupation Hungary. There has undoubtedly been considerable discussion
                            in Soviet leadership on this point with careful thought consequences
                            either course of action. Indications, although never conclusive until
                            event, seem to point to basic decision to use of force if necessary to

                            concerning troop withdrawal in order to induce rebels to surrender arms.
                            If, however, Nagy stands firm it looks at this moment as though Soviet

                        <p>At 3 p.m. on November 3, the Security Council once again took up the
                            question of Hungary. After summarizing developments over the past few
                            days, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> asked
                            Hungarian Representative Szabó whether he had any current information on
                            Nagy’s November 2 letter. He also queried <persName corresp="#p_SAN1"
                                >Sobolev</persName> about reports from Hungary which contradicted
                            his earlier assurance that Soviet troops had not <pb n="372"
                                xml:id="pg_372" facs="0402"/>been reinforced. He asked both of them
                            to comment on the status of the Hungarian-Soviet Mixed Commission
                            negotiations. Then he discussed the key elements of a draft resolution
                            (S/3730), which the United States intended to propose. It called for the
                            end of Soviet intervention in the internal affairs of Hungary and for
                            the withdrawal of all Soviet forces without delay. The Secretary-General
                            was to be requested urgently to examine and to report on the relief
                            needs of the Hungarian people.</p>
                        <p>Szabó replied that all he knew personally was the text of Nagy’s
                            communications to the Secretary-General. He did state, however, that
                            Soviet-Hungarian military negotiations had taken place and would resume
                            at 10 p.m. that night. This led to a Yugoslav motion for adjournment so
                            as not to impede ongoing negotiations. The French and British
                            Representatives were not so sanguine and thus Dixon advocated adoption
                            of the draft United States resolution. In respect to this matter,
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> then stated:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“We are still disturbed by the wide differences between Soviet
                                    Union words about troop withdrawals and Soviet Union actions, as
                                    evidenced in news reports. We believe, accordingly, that
                                    adjournment for a day or two would give a real opportunity to
                                    the Hungarian Government to carry out its announced desire to
                                    arrange for an orderly and immediate evacuation of all Soviet
                                    troops. But, clearly, the Security Council must keep this matter
                                    under urgent consideration. It may well be necessary for the
                                    Council to meet tomorrow, as the representative of Cuba
                                    suggests, if events do not bear out the reports which we have
                                    heard today. In this spirit I should be willing, as I said, to

                            comment confirmed that Soviet negotiations with Hungary were

                        <p>The fact that the General Assembly was scheduled to resume its
                            consideration of the Middle Eastern situation at 8 p.m. led the
                            President of the Council, Nasrollah Entezam of Iran, to push for a
                            decision as to when to continue the discussion of Hungarian
                            developments. Australia favored 5 p.m., on November 4. Since only six
                            nations supported this time—which was opposed by the Soviet Union while
                            the United States abstained—the Australian proposal failed to carry. The
                            Council President then suggested that the next meeting be held at 10:30
                            a.m. on November 5 and his view was adopted. (<gloss target="#t_UN1"

                            look foolish a few hours later nor on the other hand would we wish to
                            take steps <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0403"/>which might be used
                            by the Soviets as a provocation for strong action. Ambassador Alphand
                            then urged that the United States make clear publicly and officially its
                            reasons for going along with a delay regarding Soviet intervention in
                            Hungary at the same time that it is pressing ahead at full speed with
                            respect to the British and French action in the Middle East.”

                                    the people of Hungary. In this momentous hour of their national
                                    life, the Hungarian people have shown highest courage, integrity
                                    of purpose, and unfaltering spirit. Their just struggle for

                                    friendship which exists between the Hungarian and the American
                                    peoples, my Government is acting urgently at this time to
                                    espouse the cause of Hungarian freedom and independence before

                                    Your Excellency that I shall devote myself earnestly and

                                    East European countries; it would also bankrupt the ten year old

                                    firmness and wisdom. It would create a crisis in the confidence
                                    of all the East European people in the USA and [the other
                                    lands]. On the other hand in view of the adverse effects of the

                                    to end the Egyptian intervention by acting as intermediary in an
                                    armistice and on the other hand he can call on the Soviet Union
                                    to quickly withdraw its troops from Hungary. We know that the

                            in. If we do take them in I believe we will have to make it clear that
                            we cannot guarantee protection from Hungarian authorities. Have you any

                            bomb Budapest. He states that he was told that the govt would

                        <p>From <persName corresp="#p_WET1">Wailes</persName>. Just made contact
                            with head of International Red Cross to inquire what supplies have been
                            coming in as it was our opinion that roadblocks had cut off
                            transportation. In fact we have seen many Red Cross vehicles stopped
                            from entering city. Red Cross said they have enough medical supplies for
                            about ten days under present circumstances. I imagine a good bombing
                            would use them up very rapidly. Food I think is probably a more critical
                            problem as we gather that with city ringed by Soviets there is not more
                            than two or three days supply (this does not apply to Legation).</p>

                        <p>From <persName corresp="#p_WET1">Wailes</persName> 040955. Kovacs has
                            apparently left but may come back and I will let him in vestibule with
                            his lieutenants with firm understanding it is tentative and no asylum
                            granted. If they do come back and we have bombing at noon as threatened
                            in ultimatum, I will take them in for few minutes as vestibule largely
                            glass. We plan to send staff to basement just before twelve and if it

                        <p>Note on Security Council. Peruvian said yesterday we had hopes that
                            Hungarian-Soviet negotiations might produce favorable results. Soviets
                            had tried to force conditions which Hungary forced to reject. As result
                            Soviet understood to restore regime of 1948. A regime of force, he
                            added, with all objections it produces, collides with moral forces of
                            world which ultimately will defeat it. The Soviet Govt has not only
                            committed a “great crime” but also a mistake in trying to restore
                            “Stalin tyranny”. It is impossible for any state to fight with success
                            against moral forces of the world which in end will prevail for all
                            time. Soviets, he concluded, are guilty of slaughtering youth, women and
                            children and that one of the beautiful cities of Europe “the pride of
                            our culture is now being wrecked in vengeance”.</p>

                            save human life. Section 225.2 of the Foreign Service Regulations
                            (“Restrictions on Extending Asylum”), was cited. It reads: <quote

                            was a question which clearly raised a threat to the peace, this is the

                            he had no official information as to new developments in Hungary and
                            thus he asserted that the proper course would be to postpone the
                            question until reliable information was at hand. However, he did not
                            hesitate to castigate “counter-revolutionary elements” in Hungary partly
                            instigated by the “subversive activities” of the Western Powers and most
                            particularly the United States. He emphasized that Soviet forces were
                            and would remain in Hungary “pursuant to the Warsaw Pact” and were
                            engaged in suppressing “counter-revolutionary intervention and riots”.
                            The Hungarian question, he maintained, did not rightly concern the
                            United Nations and he went on to say: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    stomachs with food, is somehow inferior to a Soviet programme
                                    which fills their stomachs with lead”.</p>

                                    “Unofficially,” he reported, “we are informed that a new

                        <p>Mr. President, Franco-British action on Suez is a small wound to their
                            prestige but American inaction about Hungary could be a fatal wound to
                            ours.</p>
                        <p>Let us not ask for whom the bell tolls in Hungary today. It tolls for us
                            if freedom’s holy light is extinguished in blood and iron there. Then a
                            long dark night of cynicism, futility and despair will fold over great
                            parts of Europe and the world. And while we wait for the next light to
                            break which surely will then be very ugly and very atomic, we will hear
                            a growing torrent of tongues in many lands turning the deathless glory
                            of Hungary into America’s everlasting shame.</p>
                        <p>There are things even at this late hour which can be done. I respectfully
                            submit some suggestions: 1) You can appear in person before the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly; 2) <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> can be called into general session;
                            3) We can offer assistance to Austria in case of aggression; 4) We can
                            confine all USSR diplomatic personnel in the USA until ours in Hungary
                            are released; 5) We can notify Moscow we will break diplomatic relations
                            if the Soviet Army continues to fire on the Hungarian population
                            coupling this threat with an immediate offer to discuss guarantees for
                            Soviet security from the satellites.</p>

                        <p>The Second Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly convened at
                            4 p.m. on November 4. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAN1"
                                >Sobolev</persName> objected strongly to the inclusion of “The

                            violation of Article 2 of the United Nations Charter, which prohibited
                            intervention in the domestic affairs of member states. Continuing along
                            this line, he cited the communication from the “legal” <persName

                            inscribed on the General Assembly agenda as item 5 by a vote of 53 to 8,

                            of aggression”. Thereupon, he submitted for adoption draft resolution
                            A/3286. The draft had been formulated at the White House and telephoned
                            to the U.S. Delegation at the United Nations at 3 p.m. and <persName

                            on the Hungarian question in order to have strong Soviet support on the

                            try to keep him quiet. Our international position is not too strong on
                            trying to safeguard him. Perhaps we can get the <gloss target="#t_UN1"

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> said the Soviet trap
                            was such that they were able to get almost all political leaders in
                            Hungary out of hiding to negotiate with them, and then seized them
                            all.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President asked why Nehru is supporting the USSR by abstaining,
                            and the President suggested that Nehru thinks of only one thing, which
                            is colonialism, by which he means the white over colored people. The
                            President said he thought it might be well for him to write to Nehru,
                            bringing out that we are witnessing colonialism by the bayonet in
                            Hungary. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> said he
                            thought that if Nehru would <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395" facs="0425"
                            />line up with us in this matter, Russia would be ruined in Asia. He
                            asked if Nehru’s visit to the U.S. could be expedited and the President
                            said he was afraid that Nehru might find that things are so active that
                            he cannot leave his Government at this moment.<note n="4"

                            Hungary closely during past week and had been in constant communication

                            had been discussed at length cabinet meeting this morning and also
                            meeting CDU faction from which he had just come. In all these talks
                            parallel had been drawn between Hungary and what might have happened or
                            could happen East Zone.</p>
                        <p>Brentano continued that divergence between US one hand and France–UK on
                            other regarding Suez had provided Soviets with unique opportunity to
                            deliver what he described as worst blow West has suffered since war. He
                            said that without going into merits or demerits Anglo-French position
                            and legality or illegality their action Suez, he deplored Security
                            Council action which he felt had triggered Soviet move Hungary. Soviet
                            repressive actions there in which thousands might well be liquidated
                            could mean end to Hungarian democratic elements and this taken in
                            conjunction with divergence West would have seriously adverse effects on
                            will for freedom in other satellites and East Zone.</p>

                            since such food supplies as might be sent to Hungary would fall into

                                the Russian forces in Hungary who have, according to Moscow radio,
                                been indoctrinated along the lines that they have come into Hungary
                                to protect the Hungarian workers against fascists and black
                                reactionaries. Many of these are fresh troops, new to the Hungarian
                                scene, including young soldiers. These might be particularly good
                                targets for an effective propaganda line, if well conducted.” (<hi

                        <p>Boerner: One suggestion that has been made is that we should get refugees
                            out to various free world countries to tell their story.</p>
                        <p>Cox: The good ones are being screened and they can be taken on tours.
                            There are some points of contention, however, between some of the recent

                        <p>Boerner: We have heard that there are a large number of children among
                            the refugees and that some of them have been wounded. These might be
                            taken out to other countries and even placed for a time in homes of
                            earlier refugees who are well off.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName>: There is a lot of sympathy
                            in other countries for something along these lines. It should be
                            possible to take some action.</p>
                        <p>Boerner: If the Suez cease-fire is genuine, we might focus on it at the

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName>: It would be well if some

                        <p>The offers of US economic assistance in recent months were confined to
                            offers of agricultural products. In January–February 1956 there was an
                            offer of wheat.<note n="6" xml:id="d173fn6">See <ref target="#d68fn2"

                            discussion and exchange of correspondence with the Polish government
                            regarding these two offers involved the following points: the
                            unwillingness of the Polish government to accept the foodstuffs as a
                            gift; their rejoinder proposal that opportunities be given for Poland to
                            purchase US agricultural products at world competitive prices; the
                            additional or inferred desire on the part of the Polish government for
                            credits to finance agricultural purchases. Additional points which
                            similarly have not been clearly resolved in this matter are: (a) the
                            availability of export licenses for such goods and (b) the fact that
                            other sources of supply, such as Canada, are open to the Poles. It is
                            presumed that the Poles have canvassed other sources to obtain the most
                            favorable price and credit conditions possible.</p>
                        <p>The Department will recall that in response to the American invitation to
                            Poland to send observers to the US electoral campaign a reply was
                            received in the form of a note dated October 8, 1956 (<gloss

                        <p>The attitude which Poland assumes towards Yugoslavia and Hungary may also
                            have a decisive influence. It is too soon to estimate the extent to
                            which the <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> regime in Poland
                            will become parallel domestically, ideologically and internationally to

                            The Polish government has thus far followed a doubtful, changing and

                            <item>The American public has long been thinking about the need to offer
                                food, financial and economic help, even military aid, as well as
                                technical assistance, to under-developed countries, or to regimes
                                threatened by a Communist menace. Varieties of this ideology have
                                been the basis for Marshall Plan aid, Greek-Turkish aid, the
                                International Cooperation Administration, the Mutual Assistance
                                Program, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, and others. But it
                                is only the Yugoslav example that we have on the other side, i.e.,
                                giving aid to bolster up and strengthen a Communist regime. The
                                Yugoslav precedent is not analogous to the Polish situation. For the
                                    <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> regime reiterates
                                again and again its membership in the Warsaw Pact (Yugoslavia is
                                not) and within the past weeks has repeatedly and forcefully gone on
                                record as favoring the Soviet alliance, Polish-Soviet friendship.
                                Poland voted with the USSR on the Hungarian issue; Yugoslavia did
                                not. Tito made a greater break with Stalin, eight years ago, than

                                    policies of the USA. There is a possibility that the Warsaw Pact
                                    may be changed. When and if it is changed, this argument can be
                                    re-examined. For the present, Poland, by virtue of its
                                    geographic position, if nothing else, is almost certain to
                                    remain a member of the Pact or some similar Bloc defense
                                    arrangement as long as <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                                    exists. It is equally certain that Soviet troops in one guise or
                                    another will continue to be stationed in Poland at least as long
                                    as Soviets remain in East Germany. The <persName

                                    even defended this position during the past week. As a member of
                                    Bloc defense the foreign policy of Poland continues by
                                    definition to be inimical to the best interests of the United
                                    States and the West. The withdrawal of Soviet troops from Poland
                                    and formal withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact and other Bloc
                                    defenses would surely be a very definite indication of Polish
                                    independence; it is submitted that the <persName

                                    tanks, infantry, aircraft, and naval power could be built up and
                                    strengthened in locations strategically close to Berlin, London,
                                    Paris and Brussels. While these military build-ups continued,
                                    the US would, in effect, be subsidizing them, building them up,
                                    feeding the people who worked on those military installations.
                                    We would be, militarily speaking, working against ourselves and
                                    against our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies.

                                    thought that it was the recent deterioration of economic
                                    conditions within Poland which gave rise to the pressures that
                                    produced Poznan riots and the subsequent developments away from
                                    Soviet control. These tendencies are in keeping with US basic
                                    policies towards the satellites; we should do nothing to slow
                                    down those tendencies, or to reduce their effects. Poland helped
                                    North Korea in the war, taxing her economy to do so. That caused
                                    a direct loss of American lives and treasure. Now, should we
                                    subsidize and bolster Poland after its strong effort to defeat

                                    evidenced in all fields, agriculture, mining, industry, housing,
                                    police state, Parliament, free speech and movement of people,

                                    standard of living for a European people is the result in a
                                    country where, prior to Communism, the agriculture of the
                                    country not only fed the people but allowed surplus to be
                                    exported. This unrest exploded at the Poznan riots; it was fully
                                    documented in terms of human misery, neglected youth, low
                                    standard of living, hatred of police state, brutalities,

                            accomplished in a variety of ways. In this process, the interest and
                            assistance of US citizens of Polish extraction can be given an entirely

                            to individuals. These could be accompanied by letters, publicity, and
                            personal messages. Adverse action by the <persName corresp="#p_GW1"

                            cultural, and press freedoms and cooperation. Any prestige deriving from
                            this activity would accrue to non-Communist organizations rather than to
                            a Communist regime.</p>

                            of the Catholic church would probably place in the hands of the needy
                            those items and products which have small strategic value, and would

                            of Polish citizens with a durable pro-US effect; it would offer an
                            opportunity to private individuals and organizations in the US that have

                        <p>The foregoing is a compilation of thoughts and ideas of various members
                            of the staff at Warsaw on the subject of possible aid to Poland. It
                            represents an expansion of detailed discussion of various basic ideas
                            and suggestions already submitted to the Department as the six points in
                            Embassy telegram No. 562 of Oct. 29, 1956, and the nine points in
                            Embassy telegram 540 of Oct. 26, as well as what we call the “shopping
                            list” contained in Embassy despatch No. 175 of Nov. 6. This despatch
                            should, therefore, be considered in that sense and not as a
                            recommendation for or against aid to Poland.</p>
                        <p>As regards the desirability of extending aid to Poland, there is a
                            divergence of views even among members of my staff and between them and
                            myself as there likewise must be a divergence of views in Washington.
                            The difference is not so much, however, on the question of whether aid
                            should or should not be extended but rather a difference of opinion as
                            to what aid should be given, how it should be given, and when it should
                            be given. A decision on these points depends upon careful consideration
                            by Washington level authorities of the multiple factors covered in this

                                    foodstuffs which required what might be called the humanitarian

                                <item>Until the Polish Government gives us a more suitable reply
                                    than a press release to our aid approach of October 25, we are
                                    somewhat stopped from making further offers of aid or assistance
                                    to Poland unless we want to make ourselves look somewhat
                                    ridiculous along the lines of the song, “Please, oh please take
                                    my money”, from “Call Me Madam”.</item>

                                <item>Assuming the Polish Government responds to our approach of
                                    October 25, 1956, and we agree to enter into discussions, I am
                                    afraid that, if the response is along lines indicated by Mr.
                                    Winiewicz on Oct. 25, those discussions may be long drawn out.
                                    It is difficult for me at the present time to see how we can
                                    acquiesce in Mr. Winiewicz’s “trade not aid” formula with
                                    respect to a wide range of commodities, without strengthening
                                    and enhancing the prestige of the Polish regime which is still
                                    closely allied with the Soviet Union.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>Notwithstanding the above, I believe there is still an area in
                                    which we could extend aid and assistance which would benefit the
                                    Polish people and not too greatly add to the prestige of the
                                    regime. This field lies in the realm of exchanges of persons and
                                    some assistance largely in the agricultural and scientific
                                    fields. Such items will be found in the “shopping list”
                                    contained in Embassy despatch 175. In general, they relate to
                                    exchanges of agricultural students and technicians, the possible
                                    supply, on credit terms, of fertilizer and feed grains. Aid of
                                    this kind could be handled in such a way as to give maximum
                                    publicity in Poland so that the Polish people would know where
                                    the aid is coming from and the results would benefit, first, the
                                    Polish farmer and, second, the Polish people in general by
                                    increased production in foodstuffs.</item>

                        <p>It is not recommended that we revive the cold war on the scale of
                            intensity of the late Stalin period. We shall certainly take some steps,
                            and very definite ones, to register our revulsion against the Soviet
                            attack on Hungary. These will include a suspension of the exchange of
                            official delegations under the East-West contacts program and also
                            non-attendance at Soviet social functions. We would also view
                            sympathetically steps such as are now being undertaken by labor
                            organizations in various countries to refuse to handle Soviet ships and
                            goods.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, we would not wish to jeopardize some of the gains,
                            small as they may be, resulting from the Geneva conferences. Thus, we
                            would like the <hi rend="italic">Amerika</hi> magazine exchange to
                            continue and we should be willing to go ahead with limited cooperation
                            with the USSR in the International Geophysical Year. Unless Soviet
                            actions become generally more threatening, it would seem best to refrain
                            from drastic measures such as blocking Soviet assets, intensifying trade
                            embargoes, etc.</p>

                        <p>The Director of Central Intelligence said that he would first report
                            briefly on the situation in Hungary. He said that the Soviet repression
                            in Hungary had been ruthless and brutal to the last degree. . . . there
                            were eye-witness accounts of what had happened from the U.S. Legation in
                            Budapest. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then
                            reviewed what had happened in <pb n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0449"
                            />Hungary since the last meeting of the National Security Council,<note

                            they had now 200,000 troops deployed in Hungary. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> also alluded to <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ1">Janos Kadar</persName>, the head of the Hungarian
                            Government. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> described
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> as a potential <persName
                                corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> if his hands had not been so
                            deeply stained by the blood of his own countrymen and if he had not
                            acted in collaboration with the Soviets. Even so, he may yet turn out to
                            be a Hungarian <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName>—not, said
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, that he could put his
                            trust in <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> went on to describe
                            briefly the European reaction to what the Soviets had done in Hungary,
                            concluding that these Soviet actions had reduced Soviet prestige in
                            Western Europe to its lowest point in many years. He ended with the
                            prediction that the rebellion in Hungary would be extinguished in a
                            matter of days, if not of hours. Nevertheless, the Soviets would be
                            faced with a problem in Hungary for many, many years to come. In turn,
                            the situation presents the United States with the problem of what more
                            we can do, . . .</p>
                        <p>The President said that this was indeed a bitter pill for us to swallow.
                            We say we are at the end of our patience, but what can we do that is
                            really constructive? Should we break off diplomatic relations with the
                            USSR? What would be gained by this action? The Soviets don’t care. The
                            whole business was shocking to the point of being unbelievable. And yet
                            many people seemed unconvinced. For example, said the President, he had
                            just had a message from Nehru—or was it a point he made in a recent
                            speech? Wherever it came from, Nehru had said that what was really
                            happening in Hungary was obscure.<note n="3" xml:id="d175fn3"><hi
                                    rend="italic">The New York Times</hi> reported on November 12
                                that in a speech delivered on November 9, Nehru had several times
                                described the Hungarian situation as confusing.</note> Could
                            anything be blinder? The President also cited Premier <persName
                                corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>’s message to him received this

                                State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, November 19, 1956, pp.
                                796–797.</note> in which <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                                >Bulganin</persName> stated in effect that what was going on in
                            Hungary was none of the business of the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President inquired whether Soviet action in Hungary had produced
                            any unfavorable reaction in Asian capitals. Had anything occurred there
                            comparable to the demonstrations which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> had described as occurring in Western Europe? Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that not very
                            much in the way of unfavorable reaction had occurred in Asia, although
                            there were a few instances. The Vice President commented that this
                            seemed to indicate that our own true story had not got across in Asia.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> stated that if
                            the British and French had not at this particular time decided to move
                            into Suez, things would not have happened as they did in Hungary. If the
                            British and French had stayed out of Egypt and the Soviets had
                            nevertheless moved against Hungary, they would have been ruined in the
                            eyes of <pb n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0450"/>world public opinion.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> doubted if they
                            would under the circumstances have dared to move against Hungary. The
                            President expressed his agreement.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion of the Middle East. For text of the discussion
                            not printed here, see volume XVI, pages 1078–1086 <hi rend="italic"

                        <p>[Here follows discussion of the Soviet presence in Syria.] Furthermore,
                            the President said, it remained wholly inexplicable to him that any
                            state in the world, Syria included, would play with the Russians after
                            witnessing what had happened in Hungary. It is for this reason,
                            continued the President, that we must go on playing up the situation in
                            Hungary to the absolute maximum, so the whole world will see and
                            understand.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President agreed with the President’s proposal, and said that in
                            carrying it out we should not neglect Asia. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> indicated that the Free Europe
                            Committee was already engaged in preparing a White Paper which would
                            give the world all the facts about what had happened in Hungary from the
                            beginning.</p>
                        <p>The President proceeded to quote from his most recent message from
                                Nehru,<note n="5" xml:id="d175fn5">In his November 7 letter to the
                                President, Nehru had written as follows: “You have referred in your
                                letter to what I said about the situation in Hungary. I have,
                                indeed, been greatly troubled by what has happened there, and I drew
                                the attention of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>
                                to it. He has briefly replied and has promised to send a fuller
                                reply later. Meanwhile, we have been told by the Russian Government
                                that they had previously decided to withdraw their troops from
                                Hungary and had declared their general policy on the 30th October.
                                Subsequent events compelled them to intervene temporarily to protect
                                the lives of their own people as governmental authority appeared to
                                have vanished and, in fact, killings were taking place. I entirely
                                agree with you that armed intervention of any country in another is
                                highly objectionable and that people in every country must be free
                                to choose their own governments without interference of others.”
                                    (<persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Library,
                                Whitman File, International File)</note> commenting that Nehru
                            seemed to be falling for the Moscow line—buying their entire bill of
                            goods.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President stated that the great message which we must get across
                            to the rest of the world was that no state could afford to play in with
                            the Soviet Union unless it wished to be taken over.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion of the Middle East.]</p>
                        <p>At this point the President interrupted Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> to say that Admiral Strauss had
                            just sent him a note stating that moving pictures had been taken of
                            Soviet tanks killing Hungarians in the streets of Budapest. The
                            President asked whether such movies should not immediately be
                            disseminated through our Embassies all over the world. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_STC1">Streibert</persName> answered that the <gloss
                                target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> was already engaged in doing
                            precisely this, and was trying to get the story out just as fast as it
                            could. The President said it would be a good idea to send one of the
                            best reels to Nehru. The Vice President advised sending one to Sukarno
                            in Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion of the Middle East.]</p>
                        <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0451"/>
                        <p>The Vice President expressed the hope that while we must deal with the
                            Near East problem, we should also give the Congressional leaders a good
                            stiff talk on Hungary. There has been too great a tendency to allow
                            developments in the Near East to divert attention from Hungary. Let’s
                            assure that the Congressional leaders do not leave without a knowledge
                            of what had really happened in Hungary.<note n="6" xml:id="d175fn6">See
                                    <ref target="#d177">Document 177</ref>.</note> The Vice
                            President thought this topic should come last in the briefing, and also
                            suggested that the movies mentioned earlier should be shown to the
                            Congressional leaders.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that the present Congressional leaders have been
                            acting in a wholly admirable fashion.</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General warned the President that the Congressional leaders
                            were very likely to ask him whether, in view of what had happened, the
                            Government should not move now to exclude the Soviet Union from
                            membership in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The President
                            replied that if he were asked this question he would say that we
                            couldn’t shoot from the hip, but state that this was certainly something
                            to be considered.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion of the Middle East.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> suggested that
                            the Hungarian topic come first rather than last in the briefing of the
                            leaders. The President and many other members of the Council thought
                            this suggestion wise. The President went on to express the feeling that
                            the Russians had jumped rapidly into the Near East situation not simply
                            because the British and French had given them an opportunity, but
                            because they have long hoped that somehow or other they could reach into
                            the Middle East. Accordingly, we must be careful in briefing the
                            Congressional leaders not to place all the blame for what had happened
                            on Great Britain and France. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> expressed warm agreement with the President’s
                            suggestion. It was unwise to blame overmuch the British and the French.
                            We should instead put the Near East situation in its true perspective,
                            and indicate clearly ultimate Communist responsibility for what has
                            occurred in the Near East.</p>

                        <p>Hungary remained a subject of concern at the United Nations throughout
                            November 8. The Secretary-General addressed an aide-mémoire to the
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hungary (<gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >U.N.</gloss> doc. A/3315) in which he referred to the fact that
                            Resolution 1004 (ES–II) had called upon him to observe the Hungarian
                            situation through representatives designated by him and to report back
                            to the General Assembly “at the earliest moment”. He asked the Hungarian
                            Government if it would admit observers for the purposes specified in the
                            resolution. Until the investigation was completed, he indicated that he
                            would be unable to conclude the other matters assigned to him by the
                            resolution.</p>

                                <persName>János Szabó</persName> objected to its consideration of
                            Hungarian internal affairs as exceeding its jurisdiction, especially
                            since the new Káadár government had declared the earlier Nagy appeals
                            invalid. The Danish Representative commented that inasmuch as Szabó had
                            previously spoken for another government he thought it appropriate to
                            ask the Secretary-General to furnish information concerning his
                            credentials. (<gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> doc. A/PV.568, pages

                        <p>The United States did not believe that it could permit the Hungarian case
                            to be dismissed without further international action. Increasingly the
                            tendency was to focus on humanitarian concerns because that avoided
                            “possible undesirable repercussions in Middle Eastern case and minimizes
                            ‘Cold War’ aspects Hungary.” In that manner the United States hoped to
                            gain the initiative and not find itself confronted by proposals from
                            nations such as Italy and Pakistan, which while neither “constructive”
                            nor “responsive” to the problem would nevertheless be difficult to
                            oppose. (<gloss target="#t_Gadel1">Gadel</gloss> 1 to <gloss

                                    developments have served throughout most of the world to convict
                                    the Soviet of brutal imperialism. This was the opposite of the
                                    old situation when neutral nations would never view Russia as
                                    being guilty of either colonialism or imperialism, and when
                                    Russia would never be disbelieved and we would never be
                                    believed. Further, the Hungarian situation warns us again that
                                    the Soviet is capable of changing its face almost
                                    instantly.”</p>

                                    concluded that Russia had lost a satellite and gained a

                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> said there is the
                            feeling at <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> that for 10 years we have
                            been exciting the Hungarians through our Radio Free Europe, and now that

                        <p>The President insisted that is wrong—that we have never excited anybody

                            asked why didn’t the President consider going to farm for a little

                            won’t.</p>
                        <p>The President told <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> of
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Cabot Lodge</persName>’s call. Second
                            Hungarian resolution coming up, and they will pass it tonight. It seems
                            that at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> particularly many of our
                            European friends are asking why we are so fretful about France and
                            Britain with a few troops in Egypt, while we don’t show as much concern
                            about Hungary. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> wants
                            President to send another message to <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                                >Bulganin</persName>, saying this is before the Council again this
                            evening, and urging them to consider and act on it. Again to say we
                            would send in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observer team, to
                            determine needs for food and medicine, and getting out the wounded.</p>
                        <p>The President, however, feels there have already been too many messages.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he was not very
                            enthusiastic about another to <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                                >Bulganin</persName>. The President’s question: Are we in danger of
                            putting ourselves in wrong in that we will urge Ben-Gurion and people
                            like that if we don’t try to put same pressure on this fellow?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ reply was, I think, “Well,

                        <p>The President repeated feeling that we have excited Hungarians for all
                            these years, and now turning our backs to them when they are in a jam.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said we always have
                            been against violent rebellion. The President said he had told <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> so, but was amazed that he was
                            in ignorance of this fact.</p>
                        <p>The President said, finally, he might dictate a short message saying this
                            is again before the Council, and he wants to point out again the great
                            feeling of relief if he would support that Resolution and act upon it.

                                message was to demonstrate to the world that, despite the Soviet
                                action in Hungary, relations with the Soviet Union were normal. (<hi

                            then call his attention to the Resolution that is up again, urging him
                            to consider it, saying there is nothing else that could contribute to
                            peace of the world.</p>
                        <p>President told <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>, also, of
                            the 2 erroneous feelings in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>: (a) that
                            we more or less egged the Hungarians on into this mess, and then turned
                            our backs to them; (b) that we get very indignant about our friends in
                            Egypt, and don’t show any concern for the others.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> thinks that the French
                            only are expressing that feeling. He pointed out <persName
                                corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>’s short cryptic note on the
                            message pertaining to foods and medicines<note n="10" xml:id="d178fn10"
                                >Not further identified.</note>—and now all we could add would be
                            the one on the observers going in. He thinks if we really wanted to
                            accomplish something, we should get Nehru fired up a little bit;
                            however, <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> does not know
                            whether Nehru would go in on the observer idea.</p>
                        <p>President expressed wish that we had an Ambassador out there to whom this
                            morning’s film could be sent.<note n="11" xml:id="d178fn11"
                                    ><persName>John Sherman Cooper</persName> had left India in
                                April 1956 and Ellsworth Bunker had not yet been appointed to
                                succeed him. The film was shown at the Bipartisan Legislative
                                Leaders meeting; see <ref target="#d177">Document 177</ref>.</note>
                            Instead, he suggested Indian Ambassador. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> said it could be flown
                            over—will give that some thought.</p>
                        <p>As for this next message, <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>
                            thinks there is very grave danger of wearing out President’s appeal on
                            this situation. He wasn’t aware that there had been so many, until it
                            came out at this morning’s meeting.</p>
                        <p>The President will send him draft anyway, to be considered by State
                            people. Asked that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>

                                corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>, however, indicated that the
                            changes were unacceptable.</p>
                        <p>The first vote to be taken was on the five-power draft resolution
                            (A/3316), introduced on November 8. Ambassador Leonardo Vitetti of Italy
                            agreed to the deletion of the words “and of the Convention on Genocide”
                            prior to the vote. As amended, Resolution 1005 (ES–II) was passed by a
                            vote of 48 to 11, with 16 abstentions. Hungary and Poland joined the
                            Soviet Union in opposition to the resolution.</p>
                        <p>The amendments to the United States resolution were then collectively
                            voted on and were defeated by 45 votes to 18, with 12 abstentions. In
                            this instance, Poland and Hungary voted in the affirmative while the
                            rest of the Soviet bloc abstained. Thereafter, the United States won
                            approval of Resolution 1006 (ES–II) by a vote of 53 to 9, with Hungary,
                            Poland, and the Soviet Union casting negative ballots, while 13 nations
                            abstained. The Austrian Representative deleted the pharase “by the
                            fighting which is still continuing” from the first paragraph of the
                            preamble to his draft resolution prior to its adoption (Resolution 1007
                            (ES–II)) by a vote of 67 to 0, with 8 abstentions. Poland and Hungary
                            voted in favor; the Soviet Union abstained. The resolution reads: <quote

                        <p>1268. Proximity and ties of history and blood between Austria and Hungary
                            have perhaps distorted impression which I have received in Vienna of
                            intensity and depth of feeling in Europe as it helplessly watches what
                            appear to these Europeans as the death throes of Hungarian freedom.
                            Nevertheless the offers of haven to refugees and other acts have
                            demonstrated that the feeling of horror and frustration is not peculiar
                            to Austria. When correspondents now in Budapest are able file their
                            stories this feeling doubtless will become even more intense. In such a
                            situation it is natural that one instinctively looks for someone to
                            blame for his own impotence. Despite the British and French action in
                            Suez which does indeed draw much of the fire (and this is surely no help
                            to us) the US is the target of bitter criticism on part of many
                            Austrians and more so on part of hundreds if not thousands of Hungarians
                            with whom we have had direct or indirect contact.</p>
                        <p>One of reasons is doubtless realization that no country other than US has
                            capability of doing anything effective but reason almost universally
                            given is that past declarations of policy but more specifically our
                            radio and balloon operations have led to belief that we would be
                            prepared do more than we actually done if any of the subject peoples
                            attempted break free from Soviet tyranny. I am of course aware that
                            neither the leaflets dropped nor the nature of broadcasts were designed
                            to incite an uprising scope of these operations and in case of balloons
                            dramatic nature of method did in fact given rise in considerable measure
                            to false expectations. Regardless of cause I believe our future position
                            in this part of world will suffer greatly if Hungarian affair ends
                            without some action on part of US of a nature different from anything we
                            have done, or at least made public so far. Our actions in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> so far do not in my opinion achieve the
                            purpose as they are widely regarded here as fitting into a pattern of
                            our exploiting as part of the cold war any Soviet error. No Austrian to
                            whom I have talked has produced a concrete practical suggestion other
                            than that of an ultimatum from the US to the Soviet Union and they back
                            rapidly away from this when asked to consider its implications.</p>
                        <p>I find myself unable to make any suggestion without becoming involved in
                            discussion matters of high policy beyond my competence and to which I
                            know Department is giving most intense consideration. I am
                            insufficiently informed of recent indications Soviet intentions and <pb
                                n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0461"/>capabilities to do much more
                            than shoot in the dark. Following are therefore not recommendations but
                            suggested lines of thought and based on assumption nothing can be
                            accomplished that will at this time effectively rescue Hungarian people
                            from their tragic situation.</p>
                        <p>Any action would of course have to fit into framework of policy decision
                            whether we consider our best interest lies in eventual reestablishment
                            Soviet New Look with at least indirect encouragement satellites seek
                            freedom via path of national Communism or whether we should exploit to
                            full Soviet action Hungary in intensification cold war with risk return
                            to Stalinistic methods in East Europe and possibility new explosion. In
                            any event seems to me we should attempt channel present anti-Soviet
                            feeling in free world (as well as within Soviet bloc) into some
                            constructive direction. Apart from Hungarian question our prestige and
                            moral standing in Austria at least is higher than it has been for many
                            years and any lead we give will have major effect. Hope following may at
                            least be suggestive to those considering problem.</p>
                        <p>Appears to me that unless we see possibility direct and confidential

                            paragraph 4 of Resolution 1004 (ES–II), he named as members of the

                                >Colonel Goodpaster</persName> gave, the President was briefed on

                            In the subsequent discussion, the following points were of interest:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion of items 1–2.]</p>
                        <p>3. Several times during the conversation, the President expressed concern
                            over reports which seem to indicate that many European people had the
                            impression that the US had incited the Hungarians to rebellion. He said
                            this concerned him and we should devote all our efforts to correcting
                            this impression. He said it has never been our policy to incite captive
                            peoples to insurrection, but we have always stood ready to assist in
                            their peaceful liberation through giving strong moral support to the
                            captive peoples. I told the President that we had this problem in mind
                            and that I would of course let Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                                >Hoover</persName> know of his concern that we find means of

                                    innocent of such actions.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Meyer said that he wished to make four points about these
                                    charges. First, the chronology of events refutes them. The
                                    October 23 rally was a demonstration of sympathy with Poland and
                                    the shooting <pb n="437" xml:id="pg_437" facs="0467"/>had turned
                                    this demonstration into a riot. The legal government of Hungary
                                    had accepted the demands of the populace and the uprisings had
                                    been spontaneous. Second, <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>
                                    has never promised Western armed assistance in case of revolt
                                    nor incited the Eastern European populace to any action on the
                                    basis that such assistance might be forthcoming. Third, during
                                    the revolt we cross-reported events in Poland and Hungary; that
                                    is, we gave the Hungarians news about Polish events which
                                    Budapest did not give them and which may have encouraged them in
                                    their revolt, but this was straight news reporting and was done
                                    with the authorization of the Department of State and was
                                    consistent with policy. Fourth, we are insistent that <gloss
                                        target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> should not lecture the
                                    Hungarians nor give them tactical advice. An implication might
                                    have been made that Nagy should accept the demands of the
                                    populace but this does not bear out the allegations.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Boerner said that <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> had
                                    concentrated on reporting what went on in Hungary. As a check,
                                    he was having the Hungarian language scripts translated and
                                        analyzed.<note n="4" xml:id="d185fn4"><gloss

                                    refuted the <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> charges. <hi
                                        rend="italic">Pravda</hi> had later weakened or withdrawn

                                <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CL1">Campbell</persName> said the
                                    President’s statement might well take a positive line; that is,
                                    we have always preached freedom and it was not this but the
                                    Soviet mishandling of the Hungarians which caused the blood
                                    bath. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FEL1">Freers</persName> said
                                    that the draft statement he had seen did make that point.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Boerner said that his organization had a Hungarian defector,
                                    an eyewitness of the revolt, who was prepared to say that <gloss

                                        >RFE</gloss> had not incited revolt, and Mr. Meyer said that
                                    his organization had three refugee leaders of revolutionary
                                    committees who would say the same and who are sending a protest
                                    to the West German Free Democratic Party which had been
                                    particularly critical of the American-sponsored radio stations.
                                    The present situation was compared by Mr. Boerner to that after
                                    the East Berlin riots of June 17, 1953, when we had been accused
                                    of both action and inaction. He also mentioned critical views
                                    expressed on a domestic American television program.</p>

                                <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPH1">Burris</persName> raised the
                                    question, to whom do we address our argument? The <hi
                                        rend="italic">Pravda</hi> charges have already been pretty
                                    well met but we must consider the feelings of the refugees and
                                    of such people as the Germans, the Swiss, and also domestic
                                    sentiment. The Western European criticism seemed to be directed
                                    not so much toward the content of the radio broadcasts as to the
                                    fact that we did not follow them up with effective action to
                                    help the Hungarians. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FEL1"
                                        >Freers</persName> said that the Yugoslavs and Indians, on
                                    the other hand, had criticized our activity rather than our
                                    inactivity but we had always made it plain that we were opposed
                                    to the use of force. Mr. Boerner said that a long statement
                                    would sound too defensive. It should be a brief general
                                    statement to the effect that the demands for liberty had been so
                                    great that it had burst all bounds. The Presidential statement
                                    could not meet criticism in Germany fully but it would meet
                                    domestic American criticism. At this point, Mr. <persName

                                    not have to go to Hungary to perform its work, since it would

                                            to meet domestic needs. This might not be necessary if

                                    situation and Poland’s peculiar relations with USSR, it was
                                    difficult carry on Poland’s foreign relations and handle matters
                                    this kind. It was at this point he mentioned that USSR had good
                                    wheat crop this year (referred above) and that Poland could get
                                    hard currency credit from USSR to buy machinery but implied
                                    terms both cases would be onerous.</p>
                                <p>In concluding, he said it was his opinion that less publicity
                                    there was about matter at this time better it would be for
                                    success. He gave as his reason peculiar relations with USSR,
                                    mentioning that high representatives of government would be
                                    going in few days to Moscow to discuss Polish-USSR problems in
                                    light recent developments and that until there could be
                                    something more definite about US aid, it was difficult answer
                                    numerous inquiries from correspondents and public. Said he
                                    thought only thing could be said publicly is that two
                                    governments are discussing possibility aid through normal
                                    commercial relations. Replied I did not know how Washington
                                    would feel about this.</p>
                                <p>In concluding, said I would advise Department of what he had told
                                    me.</p>

                            mentioned not as sort of blackmail (if we don’t get aid from USA we can
                            get it from USSR) but rather to indicate decided preference for US aid,
                            along lines indicated, as compared similar assistance from USSR.</p>

                            give asylum to Hungarian refugees and provide supplies to Red Cross for
                            Hungarian relief and (c) ban all cultural and sport activities with
                            Russia. Regarding latter, asked what governments doing about Olympic
                            Games. US indicated it cancelling participation in Moscow 1957 trade
                            fair and suspending all bilateral cultural exchanges with Russians.
                            Thought this would not include Olympic Games. Netherlands reported it
                            had withdrawn from games, stressed was not governmental decision but
                            decision of sports authorities. Decision taken because atmosphere
                            inappropriate and money could more usefully be given to Hungarian

                            participate in Olympic Games. Canada thought <pb n="444" xml:id="pg_444"

                            view governments might appropriately decide on individual basis to issue

                                >NATO</gloss> position on this in view differing traditions and
                            regulations on issuing stamps. UK and Denmark had no answer from their
                            governments. No one else spoke.</p>
                        <p>US reported Presidential decision admit 5,000 Hungarian refugees. Italy
                            reported its authorities prepared accept 2,000 refugees in addition to
                            children. Canada stated it giving priority to admission Hungarian
                            refugees and had given $100,000 to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            refugee organization and $100,000 to Red Cross for Hungarian refugee
                            relief. Germany indicated it accepting 3,000 refugees. France said
                            Hungarian refugees already arriving in France, thought no limit had been
                            set on entries. Emphasized need to help aged and infirm. Portugal said
                            its authorities prepared accept 5,000 Hungarian refugees. <persName
                                corresp="#p_IBHL1">Ismay</persName> thought this evidence of
                            spontaneous desire assist Hungarian people should be publicized. At US
                            suggestion, Council agreed urge member governments support report by
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> of steps taken this regard.</p>
                        <p>US reported Norway, Denmark and Sweden supporting Kethly appearance
                            before General Assembly. Thought would be helpful if another <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> government joined in support,
                            although thought US and UK should not do it. France reported it had
                            information Kethly appeared recently at public meeting in New York,
                            where she “raised fist and said in no case should Hungary be separated
                            from Soviet Union.” France said also Kethly speaking November 13 in
                            Paris, so <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> could get idea of her
                            views. Netherlands said it planning support Kethly appearance before
                            Assembly.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_IBHL1">Ismay</persName> recalled general Council
                            view <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries should not withdraw
                            missions or heads of mission from Moscow. Canada asked what were
                            governments’ views on recognition new Hungarian regime. UK reiterated
                            view question of recognition need not involve withdrawing or leaving
                            mission since head of state unchanged. France pointed out was unwise
                            state officially recognition withdrawn, because would be forced withdraw
                            missions. Netherlands thought question should be left open and examined
                            again if Hungary raised it.</p>
                        <p>Turkey wished report its government’s views on Hungarian situation.
                            Thought was relatively simple question of popular revolt against Soviet
                            domination. Nothing could justify Soviet repression. Thought Soviet
                            action showed insincerity of its peace propaganda. Turkey could envisage
                            similar moves occurring in other satellites and thought matter should be

                        <p>1199. I have read with interest the earlier messages from Embassy Vienna
                            concerning suggestions as to how we should deal with Soviet Union in
                            connection with Hungarian events but had in general been disposed
                            refrain from comment, in part because I agree with some views expressed
                            therein and also to avoid overloading communications with telegraphic
                            dialogue with Vienna. However, Vienna’s 1268 to Department, repeated
                            Moscow 36 of November 11,<note n="2" xml:id="d188fn2"><ref
                                    target="#d181">Document 181</ref>.</note> goes beyond general
                            considerations and makes specific and concrete suggestions for an
                            approach to the Soviet Government and I feel therefore I must
                            comment.</p>
                        <p>There is much in this telegram with which I agree, including in
                            particular reference to unfortunate comment moral commitment US has
                            acquired in public opinion through heavily publicized balloon and radio
                            operations even though as is apparent these operations had nothing to do
                            with outbreak Hungarian revolution. I also agree that we should seek to
                            devise some method to channel current anti-Soviet feeling into some
                            constructive direction for the furtherance of our main purposes.
                            However, while certainly brutal repressive action may be anticipated in
                            Eastern Europe in event new outbreak, I do not believe Soviets can or
                            are contemplating return Stalinist rule.</p>
                        <p>With reference to concrete suggestions in Embassy Vienna <gloss
                                target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>, I would oppose any approach
                            Soviet Government along those lines since I feel results would be almost
                            exactly contrary to purpose intended. Even if any reliance could be
                            placed on “firm commitment” for future withdrawal Soviet troops, time
                            period proposed, six months to one year, would offer Soviets and puppet
                            government considerable margin of time to consolidate Communist regime
                            and liquidate any possible anti-Communist leadership in Hungary. To
                            offer in exchange <pb n="446" xml:id="pg_446" facs="0476"/>to recognize
                            “any Hungarian government” would seem to me to make US an accessory
                            after the fact and would in essence, at least for period contemplated,
                            legalize retention [garble].</p>
                        <p>I am not advocating that we should refuse all connection with whatever
                            new Hungarian “government” may emerge from current situation or withdraw
                            our Legation, but believe this question should be reserved pending
                            developments.</p>

                            in which our attitude is clearly set forth on this point. While I agree
                            in principle we should concentrate on withdrawal Soviet troops, as
                            earlier suggested from Vienna (Vienna’s 1205 to Department<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d188fn4">Telegram 1205, November 8, estimated that any
                                national Communist regime in Hungary would not have enough popular
                                support to govern. The Soviet alternatives were either to impose
                                military occupation or to concede many of the demands concerning
                                internal affairs that had sparked the fighting. Ambassador <persName
                                    corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> believed the United States
                                should seek Soviet troop withdrawal rather than concentrate on the
                                nature of the government. Any decision on recognition of the
                                Hungarian Government should be based on its ability to ensure the
                                removal of Soviet troops. (Department of State, Central Files,
                                764.00/11–856)</note> repeated Moscow 33), I do not believe
                            realistically any distinction can be made between presence Soviet troops
                            and nature political regime since latter is totally dependent on former
                            and entire purpose Soviet action with all its consequences to Soviet
                            reputation throughout world was to ensure retention Communist political
                            system. In circumstances I cannot see, beyond keeping our moral position
                            intact, much that we can possibly do to help Hungarian people at this
                            juncture short of use of force which would be a direct military
                            encounter with Soviet troops and which for variety reasons I assume is
                            not within our calculations. However, while recognizing with regret our
                            inability to do much effective and in understandable desire to do
                            something, we should be extremely careful not in any way become involved
                            in approval or sanction Soviet actions.</p>
                        <p>On general course Hungarian developments I believe Soviet policy will
                            clearly be to promote national Communism in Hungary and will endeavor
                            while insuring maintenance Communist system to produce developments
                            somewhat along Polish line; publication here of <persName

                            much in that direction. In conclusion, however, I am in entire agreement
                            with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>’s views
                            that we should re-examine our entire position in Eastern Europe with I

                                        authorized the use by American voluntary agencies in Austria
                                        of 2,000 tons of food to Hungarians needing food relief. On
                                        November 3, a program of $20 million of emergency relief was
                                        offered to the Hungarian people. Events in Hungary over the

                                    <p>Meantime the Department is considering the advisability of a
                                        revision in US policy to permit dollar sales of agricultural
                                        products at world market prices to Poland (and perhaps
                                        Hungary, depending on further developments in that country)
                                        for cash or credit. Should the Department recommend a
                                        revision in current US policy and that recommendation were
                                        accepted, the US would be able to permit sales for dollars
                                        at world market prices for the item in which Poland thus far
                                        has shown the chief interest, namely wheat. The other major
                                        agricultural product that would be affected would be cotton.
                                        If in addition to cash sales the US should also permit
                                        extension of credit, Poland could then apply for an
                                        Export-Import Bank loan for up to 18 months. Commodity
                                        Credit Corporation also has a program of up to 3 year loans
                                        to American exporters—the benefits of which the latter are
                                        permitted to pass on to foreign buyers.</p>

                                        designed to facilitate international trade among countries

                                        membership. A time gap of some length would therefore be
                                        indicated before actual membership could be effected. Tariff
                                        concessions, moreover, would have little significance in

                                        membership, its quota in the International Bank was $125
                                        million (of which 2% must be paid in gold or dollars). Its
                                        quota in the International Monetary Fund was also $125
                                        million of which 25% normally would need to be paid in gold

                                            to the signatory countries, it should be considered
                                            whether attempts to negotiate such treaties might not
                                            have an immediately disadvantageous propaganda effect,
                                            or even provide bases for some sort of intervention by
                                            the U.S.S.R.</item>

                                        <item>It is understood that in the case of Poland the
                                            government intends to retain its communistic system. The
                                            normal treaty of friendship, commerce, and navigation
                                            has been designed to establish standards for countries
                                            where free enterprise prevails at least to an
                                            appreciable extent. No treaty project for a country with
                                            a wholly socialistic economy has yet been devised, and
                                            there would be serious problems involved in the
                                            development of such a project. Some of the provisions of
                                            the normal treaty could doubtless be adapted, but the
                                            heart of the treaty consists in the provisions relating
                                            to private investment, and those could have little
                                            application in a communistic economy.</item>

                                <item>“5. Review the advisability of further adjusting claims which
                                    the United States may have against Poland or Hungary, such as
                                    those arising out of World War I debt, nationalization and
                                    expropriation, lend-lease, defaulted dollar bonds, and surplus
                                    property sales.”</item>
                            </list>
                            <p>There would appear to be little room for beneficial adjustment as
                                concerns Polish World War I debts. Most foreign countries consider
                                World War I debts as completely dead, and Poland doubtless has no
                                thought of ever resuming payments. Its last such payment was in
                                1930, and with the exception of Finland no other debtor countries
                                are making payments. Furthermore, a unilateral adjustment with
                                Poland would raise problems regarding the status of all World War I
                                debts.</p>
                            <p>Surplus property credits also do not lend themselves well to
                                adjustment. The magnitude of these claims is relatively well
                                established and similar claims exist against a number of other
                                countries. In such cases, it has been United States policy not to
                                write down claims even when United States aid is simultaneously
                                extended to the country in question. Poland has been making regular
                                dollar payments on the annual principal installment of these
                                credits, but not on the interest installment.</p>
                            <p>There is no lend-lease account outstanding with Poland.</p>
                            <p>The settlement of defaulted dollar bonds held by private United
                                States residents is a matter ordinarily negotiated by the Foreign
                                Bondholders Protective Council, Inc. We might wish to suggest to the
                                Poles that they reopen these negotiations if this should be
                                consistent with our broad approach to Polish debts.</p>
                            <p>The value of United States claims arising out of Polish
                                nationalization and expropriation has never been calculated closely.
                                As an example: very rough estimates made in 1946 and 1951 vary from
                                $80 to $150 million. There is obviously much room for adjustment as
                                concerns these claims. We should welcome reopened negotiations, but
                                would want to examine the individual claims closely before arriving
                                at a precise magnitude in our negotiating position.<note n="9"

                                    16. He thought it might be appropriate to sell Poland surplus
                                    agricultural commodities at world dollar prices. If Poland took
                                    the initiative, he indicated his receptivity to any effort that
                                    nation might take to join international economic and financial
                                    organizations. He considered the conclusion of a treaty of
                                    friendship, commerce, and navigation to be premature, because
                                    Polish internal conditions precluded agreement on many points
                                    the United States believed essential. Finally, he supported
                                    opening negotiations to settle outstanding claims. (<persName

                        </list>
                        <p>The following comments on possible changes in the implementation of
                            United States policy in Rumania as a result of recent events, are
                            forwarded as representing my preliminary thoughts.</p>
                        <p>During the last year, in accordance with United States policy, I have
                            been encouraging closer relations with the Rumanian Government both in
                            the cultural and economic spheres. This encouragement has been expressed
                            along lines consistent with and directed towards the long-term objective
                            of attempting to wean Rumania away from the Soviet bloc orbit. It has
                            been directed towards bringing home to the Rumanian regime, particularly
                            through pressure from lower levels where leadership is in the hands of
                            opportunists or professional technical men rather than hard-core
                            Communists, the greater advantages, both economic and cultural, to be
                            obtained from close association with and dependence upon the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, I have urged the Department to grant visas to Rumanian
                            agricultural representatives to visit the United States, study U.S.
                            agricultural processes, and purchase hybrid corn and agricultural
                            equipment; to permit a representative of the Dept. of Foreign Trade to
                            investigate the sale of cement to the United States; to permit a group
                            of Rumanian chemists to investigate contract possibilities in the United
                            States; to encourage the sending of U.S. athletes, musicians, artists,
                            and exhibits on an exchange basis to Rumania; and to develop trade in
                            non-strategic goods to the fullest possible extent. By the same token I
                            have attempted in my personal relations with representatives of the
                            Rumanian Government to be friendly, inviting them to the Residence and
                            entertaining them as I would representatives of countries with whom we
                            have normal diplomatic relations. All members of the Legation staff have
                            done likewise.</p>
                        <p>The attempt to implement U.S. policy by these procedures has, I believe,
                            resulted in progress and has been well justified though nothing
                            spectacular could of course be expected in so short a time. Tremendous
                            interest in the possibilities of U.S. trade have been stimulated by the
                            above described visits and by visits of U.S. businessmen to Rumania.
                            Rumanian experience with U.S. agricultural machinery has whetted their
                            appetite for more. Not only I myself, but every member of the <pb
                                n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0484"/>Legation staff is bombarded
                            with questions concerning the possibilities of trade. The recent
                            conference [<hi rend="italic">convention</hi>] initiated by the
                                Romanians<note n="2" xml:id="d190fn2">See <ref target="#d139"
                                    >Document 139</ref>.</note> was solely, I submit, for the
                            purpose of working out, as a part of the mechanism for the settlement of
                            claims, an incentive for the U.S. to trade with Rumania. By the same
                            token in the cultural field we are being pressed for movies, exhibits,
                            and visiting artists and musicians. The desire for close relations with
                            us is a natural one on the part of those at the operating level of the
                            Government. As stated before most of them are not Communists and have
                            western affiliations. Once restrictions on their natural instinct to
                            deal with us have been lifted by the top hierarchy, they fall all over
                            themselves in their eagerness for U.S. contacts. We may take it for
                            granted that interest and anticipation of what Rumania can gain from the
                            United States is at this moment at a high pitch.</p>
                        <p>The recent events in Hungary, in which Rumania played a considerable
                            part, acting as a base for Soviet operations and a communication channel
                            for the transportation of Soviet troops between Hungary and the Soviet
                            Union, and through its press following minutely the Soviet line
                            including open attacks upon the United States as backing the so-called
                            fascist invasion of Hungary warrants a close study of our immediate
                            future actions in this country, with particular reference to the
                            continuation of the above described procedures towards increased
                            economic and cultural activity. It is particularly important to consider
                            what effect our reaction to these events can have on our ultimate
                            objective. The following analysis attempts to present some of the
                            factors to be considered:</p>
                        <p>In a recent visit to the Department,<note n="3" xml:id="d190fn3">See <ref
                                    target="#d42">Document 42</ref>.</note> I set forth in
                            conferences my theory on the possibility of trying to woo the Rumanians
                            away from dependence on the Soviets by the above described procedures
                            and I urged that these procedures be stepped up. This theory was based
                            on the premise that in this country, first of all, quite possibly the
                            Soviet guard was lowered further than anywhere else. This was due to the
                            fact that the naturally apathetic and non-aggressive Rumanian people had
                            been in the last ten years terrified into complete submission, and the
                            absence of any leadership outside of the regime, as well as the absence
                            of any serious difference within the Communist Politburo reduced the
                            chances of even an attempt at revolt to a minimum. Secondly, in this
                            country there are fewer hard-core Communists than in any of the
                            satellite countries. The old regime was thrown out, and the new
                            Communist regime installed by the Soviet Union from the top, not by the
                            acts of any large or active indigenous Communist group; necesarily
                            therefore, non-Communist opportunists, technicians <pb n="455"
                                xml:id="pg_455" facs="0485"/>and professional and businessmen hold
                            positions of considerable importance in the government; there are not
                            sufficient Communists with ability or know-how to go around. As a result
                            of these two conditions, it seemed to me that an unusual opportunity was
                            offered for experimentation in the field of bringing pressure on the top
                            leaders, through these non-Communist groups, which might start forces
                            that eventually would be difficult to control. If these technical and
                            professional men, whose job it is to try and implement the five-year
                            plans and bring about the steady advance of the industrialization
                            program of the Communist regime, could get a taste of what the U.S.
                            could offer Rumania in this field, there was every likelihood of their
                            bringing pressure to bear on the Politburo to take advantage of these
                            opportunities. The Rumanian regime could be made to begin to appreciate
                            how much faster the country would grow with guidance from the West than
                            from the East.</p>
                        <p>However, by the same token, it seems obvious that it is especially
                            important to indicate to the regime, and at all levels, how much Rumania
                            can suffer from close association with the Soviets. The dangers of
                            permitting this country to indulge in one of her most prevalent
                            weaknesses, that of having her cake and eating it too, and letting her
                            get benefits from the United States without suffering detriment from
                            wrongs (even if forced upon her) committed as a result of her Soviet
                            connections, are very clear. It is just as essential, I submit, to bring
                            home to her very forcibly by shock treatment the handicaps and
                            frustrations she can suffer as a result of Soviet domination, as it is
                            to show her the greater advantages she can reap from other than Soviet
                            affiliations.</p>
                        <p>The most effective way of accomplishing this in my opinion would be to
                            cut off immediately all trade negotiations of any kind and permit no
                            more export licenses to be issued to Rumania for the time being. The
                            reasons for this action should be simply and clearly stated to the
                            Rumanian authorities concerned with these matters. This should include
                            particularly the Garst<note n="4" xml:id="d190fn4">Garst’s comments on

                            Rumanians set great store by the Garst relationship.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted, also, that the first of the above premises is of
                            course no longer true. The experience of the Soviets with Hungarian
                            resistance and the loyalty of the Hungarian army to the people is bound
                            to make them very careful in all satellite countries, including Rumania,
                            from now on.</p>
                        <p>It remains to be determined what should be done in the cultural field.
                            Our efforts in this field are only in the very initial stages. First of
                            all for obvious reasons it is believed that of course all cultural
                            relations <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0486"/>should be held in
                            abeyance until emotional feelings aroused by the Hungarian affair have
                            quieted down. Thereafter, it is submitted, these relations should be
                            slowly resumed and gradually built up. Cultural relations result in
                            benefits for the people as distinguished from the regime. They stimulate
                            and maintain interest in the United States on the part of the people.
                            Cultural relations in the trade field such as moving pictures of United
                            States machinery and trade practices can drive home to the level upon
                            which we wish to work the benefits of U.S. trade which the relation of
                            the regime with the Soviets has prevented from coming to fruition. It is
                            particularly in this line that an effort should be made after the
                            passage of a suitable time.</p>
                        <p>The Rumanian Government as well as the other satellites, has been
                            concentrating during the past year in building up its prestige in the
                            eyes of the Western and particularly of the Afro-Asian world. Strong
                            efforts have been made and have been continuing to persuade me to advise
                            my Government to raise United States diplomatic representation to the
                            rank of Ambassador. At the present time there are only four Ministers
                            here besides myself. England, France and Italy have been recently joined
                            by Egypt. It is reported that Israel and Argentina will increase their
                            representation to that of Minister. I have recently been holding
                            informal conversations with the British, French and Italian Minister on
                            the question of the advisability of an announcement by each of our
                            governments separately that Rumania’s close adherence to the Soviet
                            Union recently has convinced us that she has not shown sufficient
                            independence to warrant our having any more representation than a Chargé
                            d’Affaires here. It is agreed that this would have a shattering effect
                            on Rumanian prestige and in view of their particular temperament be
                            unusually effective in its impact.</p>
                        <p>What effect this could have on the Rumanian people is a matter that
                            should be carefully considered. The present reaction of the Rumanian
                            people is one of extreme disappointment, amounting in some instances to
                            disgust and disapprobation, at the failure of the United Nations and of
                            the United States to come to the aid of the people of Hungary. This is a
                            familiar and expected reaction of a people who have no intention of
                            sticking their own necks out but expect everyone to rush to their aid at
                            no matter what risk. Further discouragement by such action as that
                            described above would not in my opinion make them any more supine than
                            they are now. It would not make them dislike the present regime or hate
                            the Soviets less. There is not only no present resistance but there are
                            no signs of resistance in the future which might be discouraged by this
                            action. It is not believed that the morale of the people would suffer as
                            a result of such action.</p>
                        <p>It is recognized that this entire matter is deserving of considerably
                            more studied treatment than has been given to it in this preliminary
                            despatch. These thoughts are submitted as first reactions to the events
                                <pb n="457" xml:id="pg_457" facs="0487"/>in Hungary. These events,
                            due to their geographic proximity, the active participation of the
                            regime in furnishing transportation for Soviet troops, and above all the
                            close affiliation of the Hungarian minority in Rumania to the people of
                            Hungary, have made a tremendous impact on the people of Rumania. They
                            are watching and will continue to watch the reaction of the United
                            States (for which they have had extensive admiration amounting in some
                            instances to adulation) with the greatest attention.</p>

                        <p>As a consequence of the tragic events in Hungary more than 25.000
                            refugees have, within a few days, crossed the Austrian frontiers and
                            have found shelter in Austria. In view of the nature of the fighting as
                            well as of the incredible sufferings in Hungary it is to be expected
                            that the stream of refugees will continue and that their number will
                            increase considerably.</p>
                        <p>Austria has during the last decade given shelter to more than half a
                            million refugees, about 190.000 of whom are still in this country. Just
                            as in the case of all these earlier refugees, Austria in these days is
                            conscious of her obligations imposed by humanitarian principles and she
                            readily grants asylum to all refugees in accordance with the convention
                            on refugees. These refugees are crossing the Austrian frontiers without
                            any belongings, partly sick and wounded, accompanied by their wives and
                            children. Austria assumes a considerable burden in taking care of these
                            refugees.</p>
                        <p>The Austrian Federal Government notes with satisfaction that a number of
                            states have already in the first days declared themselves ready to share
                            these burdens with Austria by accepting refugees in their countries and
                            by contributing money and relief donations. In view of the great number
                            of refugees that have come to Austria and of <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458"
                                facs="0488"/>those that are still to be expected, the Austrian
                            Federal Government, however, considers it necessary that all states who
                            share the belief in the principles of humanity continue to contribute to
                            the burdens thus arising, in proportion to their economic possibilities.
                            The Austrian Federal Government, therefore, urgently requests all these
                            states to facilitate the fulfilment of this task. The Austrian Federal
                            Government believes that the following measures would primarily
                            constitute most effective help for the refugees.</p>

                            <item>The rapid admission of refugees to the various countries. The
                                Austrian Federal Government, however, would like to point out that a
                                prior examination of the human and economic qualification of the
                                refugees as a condition for their admission, as well as an admission
                                of only certain age groups, or an admission subject to other
                                qualifications would not constitute effective assistance. Austria
                                cannot examine the economic or human qualifications for each refugee
                                to remain in Austria, but grants shelter to whoever asks for asylum.
                                It is, therefore, only just that the other states should admit
                                refugees in the same varying composition as they are being admitted
                                by Austria. In particular it should be avoided that families be
                                separated by admitting for immigration only ablebodied and younger
                                persons.</item>

                                in order to avoid surplus in one field and scarcity in another:

                                Interior, which will act as a central point for such relief
                                shipments. The use and distribution of those relief goods will also
                                be accounted for in time.</item>

                        <p>On November 15, Cuba introduced in the General Assembly a draft
                            resolution, which was subsequently twice revised, dealing with the issue
                            of deportations. The United States supported A/3357/Rev.2 despite a
                            reference to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the
                            Crime of Genocide. Operative paragraph 2 of the draft, as amended, urged
                            the Soviet Union and Hungary to cease deportation of Hungarian
                            citizens.</p>
                        <p>Ceylon, India, and Indonesia also introduced a draft resolution on
                            forcible deportations on November 19, which was revised three times.
                                (<gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> doc. A/3368/Rev.3) This
                            resolution urged Hungary to accede to the Secretary-General’s request to
                            allow observers to enter Hungary in order to report on the issue of
                            forcible deportation.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State view was that the United States Delegation should
                            not lobby too strongly for passage, but that a U.S. vote in favor would
                            serve to secure Asian cooperation. Some Latin American delegations and
                            some members of the United States Delegation had reservations about the
                            Asian resolution in that, unlike the Cuban proposal, it did not accept
                            as fact the information about the Hungarian deportations. But since the
                            overriding consideration was the desire to get observers into Hungary, a
                            positive vote was considered advantageous. The full positions of the
                            United States Delegation to the Eleventh Session of the General Assembly
                            are in the minutes of the third meeting of the delegation,

                        <p>On November 21, both the Cuban and the Asian resolutions on deportations
                            were adopted by substantial votes, but Hungary and the Soviet Union
                            opposed in each instance. In addition to Resolutions 1127(XI) and
                            1128(XI), a third resolution was passed that day dealing with refugee
                            relief. (1129(XI)) For text of these resolutions, see <gloss

                            Deportations which had been on a considerable scale may have been
                            reduced or stopped because of protests by the Hungarian people. The
                            Hungarian Foreign Office is confused and refers everything to the Soviet
                            Union. Satellite missions and the Indian mission in Budapest are getting
                            excellent treatment in contrast to other missions. The U.S. is
                            maintaining a policy of aloofness to the <persName corresp="#p_KJ1"
                                >Kadar</persName> regime and is watching developments. We think it

                        <p rend="center">General Considerations</p>
                        <p>1. Events of great magnitude in Poland and Hungary necessitate an
                            appraisal of the situation and consideration of current U.S. policies,
                            objectives, and courses of action toward those countries. Our initial
                                <pb n="464" xml:id="pg_464" facs="0494"/>objective toward the
                            Eastern European satellite area has been to encourage, as a first step
                            toward eventual full national independence and freedom, the emergence of
                            “national” communist governments. While these governments might continue
                            to be in close political and military alliance with the Soviet Union,
                            they would be able to exercise to a much greater degree than in the past
                            independent authority and control in the direction of their own affairs,
                            primarily confined in the first stage to their internal affairs.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Poland</hi></p>
                        <p>2. Developments in Poland appear favorable to the attainment of this
                            objective. The <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> Government
                            has proclaimed its “national independence and equality” and has asserted
                            its right to pursue its own internal road to “socialism”. At the same
                            time it has declared continued loyalty to its alliance with the USSR
                            and, though requesting the retirement of Soviet armed forces to their
                            usual stations, has declared Soviet troops must remain in Poland and
                            East Germany.</p>
                        <p>3. In Poland, as in Hungary, recent developments have revealed the strong
                            anti-Russian and anti-communist sentiments of the population. Unlike
                            Hungary, the existence of strong leadership in Poland at a critical
                            moment, fear of a reunified Germany with irredentist claims, and the
                            timely promise of reforms, together with an assertion of “national
                            independence” linked with a closely calculated defiance of Russian
                            pressure, evidently has served to enable a reconstituted Polish
                            communist government to set forth on its new course with the
                            acquiescence, if not support, of the majority of Poles.</p>
                        <p>4. The United States has already indicated directly to the new Government
                            that a Polish request for economic assistance, particularly for wheat or
                            other surplus commodities, would be given sympathetic study.<note n="2"

                            Severe legal and administrative limits are imposed on such

                            materially aiding Poland in the general area of trade with the free
                            world.</p>

                        <p>5. Developments in Hungary have differed significantly from those in
                            Poland. In Hungary, a nationalist movement, similar to that in Poland,
                            was triggered into national revolt by the intervention of Soviet troops
                            called in by the Hungarian Government in the first hours of its
                            difficulty. The subsequent demands of the people on the government went
                            far beyond those originally sought and became anti-communist <pb n="465"
                                xml:id="pg_465" facs="0495"/>as well as anti-Soviet. Under Nagy, the
                            Hungarians moved from a program of modest reforms to one in which the
                            Nagy Government announced Hungary’s withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact and
                            appealed to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> for aid in obtaining
                            the cessation of Soviet intervention, the withdrawal of Soviet troops
                            and the recognition of Hungarian neutrality.</p>
                        <p>6. The Soviet Government renewed on November 4 its efforts to suppress
                            the Hungarian revolt by installing a new puppet regime headed by
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName>, and by the employment

                                >Kadar</persName> regime has reverted to a program of modest reform
                            promises including a promise to negotiate in the future for the
                            withdrawal of Soviet forces while making it clear that the political and
                            military alliance with the USSR must be maintained.</p>
                        <p>7. The direct intervention of Soviet troops in fighting the Hungarian
                            population, and the threat of intervention of Soviet forces in Poland,
                            illustrate that, at least in those countries where Soviet troops are
                            stationed, the Soviet Union is willing to use its armed forces to
                            prevent the coming into power of a non-communist government, or to
                            prevent a communist government from altering a policy of close military
                            and political alliance with the USSR. Moscow was apparently willing in
                            the case of Poland to accept, however reluctantly, a communist
                            government which, while remaining loyal to its military and political
                            alliance with the USSR, asserts its “national independence” and its
                            right to pursue its own internal road to communism.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Policy Conclusions</p>
                        <p>8. The events in Poland and Hungary have revealed to both the Soviet
                            Union and the rest of the world how much the maintenance of Soviet
                            control in East Germany and Eastern Europe depends upon the presence of
                            Soviet forces in this area. . . .</p>
                        <p>9. It seems unlikely that U.S. action short of overt military
                            intervention or obvious preparation for such intervention would lead the
                            USSR deliberately to take steps which it believed would materially
                            increase the risk of general war. Soviet suspicions of U.S. policy and
                            present circumstances which involve Soviet troop movements and alerts
                            probably increase the likelihood of a series of actions and
                            counter-actions which might lead to war.</p>

                        <p>12. In the development of economic relations with Poland encourage the

                            were: (1) to keep alive behind the Iron Curtain the idea and hope of
                            freedom, (2) to reflect U.S. interest in and concern for the welfare of
                            the East European peoples, (3) to state periodically that the U.S. could
                            not accept Soviet domination of the enslaved peoples of satellite
                            Eastern Europe as permanent, (4) to voice U.S. support of the right of
                            the peoples of Eastern Europe to governments and institutions of their
                            own choosing, and reinforce the belief that the Soviet puppet regimes
                            can not meet the test of history, (5) to foster satellite nationalism,
                            and (6) to keep alive a sense of identification with Western ideals.</p>
                        <p>In compliance with <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> directives, these
                            lines of emphasis did encourage the satellite people to stand fast in
                            the face of their Soviet dominated regimes. However, <gloss
                                target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> did not incite to revolt nor did it in
                            any way commit the U.S. to any action to restore liberty to the Soviet
                            satellite nations. For the most part the above lines were formulated in
                            public statements by high-level U.S. Government officials and were
                            emphasized as appropriate in <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>
                            output.</p>
                        <p>After the Summit Meeting these lines were modified upon the
                            recommendation of Minister Ravndal, who expressed the view that the
                            Hungarian people did not need to be reminded of Soviet oppression—that
                            they were already doing all that could properly be expected of them, and
                            were aware of U.S. sympathy. Accordingly, <gloss target="#t_VOA1"
                                >VOA</gloss> output to Hungary placed greater emphasis on news of
                            important world developments <pb n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0501"/>of
                            interest to the Hungarian people, on features depicting American life
                            and thought, and on the theme of peaceful change. Also, after the 20th
                            Congress of the <gloss target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss>, a major effort
                            was made to encourage evolutionary changes weakening the ties binding
                            the satellites to the Soviet Union. This was promoted primarily by
                            cross-reporting evolutionary actions and trends within the Soviet
                            orbit.</p>

                            the events in Hungary. The statements of the President and the actions

                            we had to rely in large measure on Hungarian sources, extreme caution
                            was exercised to avoid broadcasting back news which might prove
                            inaccurate or inflammatory. All news carried in the broadcasts was
                            centrally gathered and carefully edited.</p>
                        <p>In its tone, the Hungarian broadcasts were calm, factual, and objective.
                            Care was taken to omit material, although verified, which might have had
                            an incendiary effect on the Hungarian audience, such as stories
                            concerning Soviet atrocities. Certain programs even warned the freedom
                            fighters to be cautious and not go too fast.</p>
                        <p>Anna Kethly, a leader of the Hungarian Social Democratic Party, and a
                            member of the <persName>Imre Nagy</persName> Government, at a press
                            conference in Washington last week stated that the Hungarian uprising
                            was a spontaneous revolt and was not instigated by any outside source.
                            U.S. broadcasts kept the patriots informed, but did not inspire their
                            actions.</p>

                            and two of his lieutenants sought asylum at US Legation on morning
                            November 4.<note n="2" xml:id="d198fn2">See <ref target="#d162">Document

                            overnight granted due heavy bombardment. Legation officers who conversed
                            with Kovacs impressed by his sincerity and honesty. Some hurt feelings
                            involved on his part because he like Hungarians in general had presumed
                            on greater American aid than was possible to grant.</p>
                        <p>Hungarian-speaking officer of Legation engaged Kovacs in conversation
                            which led to discussion of <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> and of US policy vis-à-vis
                            satellites in general. Kovacs expressed opinion that US radio misled
                            Hungarian people into believing they could count on effective US aid in
                            event of trouble with Soviets. Kovacs said official pronouncements from
                            highest US Government levels had also lent toward creating this
                            illusion. He vehemently stated his opinion that if US policy toward
                            Soviet Communism was purely defensive one the US should have directed
                            its anti-Communist propaganda activities at USSR and should have left
                            the East European states alone. Kovacs left little doubt that in his
                            opinion the US for the attainment of its own selfish goals, had
                            cynically and cold-bloodedly maneuvered the Hungarian people into action
                            against the USSR.</p>
                        <p>Although in opinion of the Legation the Hungarians would have acted the
                            same even though our radio media had pursued more moderate line
                            vis-à-vis the Hungarian Communist Government, there is no question that
                            our past radio propaganda is at present source of much embarrassment to
                            us. Legation personnel who have lived through entire period here since
                            October 23 are keenly aware of idealistic manner in which Hungarians
                            have behaved and of the high moral plane on which revolution was
                            conducted. This makes it all the more difficult to explain or attempt to
                            justify our radio propaganda programs and political pronouncements—a
                            fact which I feel most strongly should be borne in mind in formulating
                            future programs and pronouncements both for Hungary and other curtain
                            countries.</p>

                        <p>We have read Budapest cable No. 324 of November 19, 1956, particularly
                            the third paragraph, with much interest.</p>
                        <p>For many years, the relationship between our Legation in Budapest and the
                            Voice of America was a model of cooperation, support and understanding
                            between the field and Washington. In a steady stream of telegrams,
                            despatches and official-informal communications, the Legation in
                            Budapest continuously and immediately informed Washington of
                            developments in Hungary and usually made recommendations as to how these
                            developments were to be treated by the media. The former minister to
                            Budapest, Mr. Ravndal, was a strong believer in the necessity and
                            efficiency of <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> programming to
                            Hungary, once calling it the most effective arm of American policy in
                            Hungary and his staff shared this view. On his return to the United
                            States last summer, on the occasion of a Hungarian-American celebration
                            in Cleveland, Ambassador Ravndal requested that his address there in
                            Hungarian be broadcast to Hungary by the Voice and this was done with
                            wide coverage.<note n="3" xml:id="d200fn3">The speech was broadcast in
                                August and September. (Telegrams 53 and 65 to Budapest, August 20

                        <p>A number of the recommendations and suggestions made by our mission in
                            Budapest could not be used either because of the volume of the
                            suggestions or because of the necessity to maintain in Hungarian output
                            a careful balance and necessary attention to commentaries on American
                            foreign policy and features and other material projecting the American
                            way of life. Because of over-all policy considerations, it was normally
                            impossible for the Hungarian Service to use suggestions made by the
                            mission in Budapest that it speculate on certain developments as they
                            occurred.</p>

                            media recommendations is very long and the recommendations themselves
                            usually most detailed. To cite but a few examples of recent months,

                            ferment within organizations and groups in Hungary and recommended
                            review of what it termed the miserable failures of the Communist regime.
                            The Legation asked that the media play up the rich and varied life in
                            the contemporary United States, and by inference stress the barrenness
                            of life under Communist rule (for example, Telegram 431 of June 1).<note

                            The Legation called attention to the many efforts of the Communist
                            regime to mislead the Hungarian public and called on us to expose the
                            true aims of Communism (for example, Telegram 457 of June 19 and
                            Telegram 3 of July 2).<note n="6" xml:id="d200fn6">Neither printed. (<hi

                        <p>During the two months immediately preceding the insurrection in Hungary,
                            the Legation frequently recommended the exploitation of the demands of
                            the intellectual groups for more freedom. In doing so, Hungarian Service
                            output constantly kept in mind the recommendation that the intent of
                            their reporting these demands should not be to encourage these
                            intellectuals further, but to make their attitudes known to the
                            Hungarian public at large, and that treatment of these matters should be
                            phrased so as to make them intelligible to the workers and peasants.</p>
                        <p>The mission in Budapest had probably the outstanding record among Iron
                            Curtain missions in monitoring our output. Under approved arrangement,
                            until the uprising there was a <hi rend="italic">weekly</hi> exchange of
                            “official-informal” communications between the Hungarian Service Chiefs
                            in Washington and Munich and officers of the Legation in Budapest in
                            which programming was discussed in detail. In addition to this weekly

                        <p>“The <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> Washington scripts, embracing as
                            they do the period of the Petofi Club activities and the ‘resignation’
                            of Matyas Rakosi, treat a critical phase of Hungary’s recent history.
                            Judged by this background the scripts are distinguished by the fine
                            balance which <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> Washington maintained
                            during this period. A perusal of the scripts gives the feeling that a
                            regular listener to these broadcasts would receive the impression that
                            the flow of world events was toward greater freedoms and that in
                            abetting this flow the Hungarian people were playing their traditional
                            liberty-loving role. Highly commendable is the series of programs on
                            human rights. Coming at the present, this series emphasizes the fact
                            that at least some Hungarian Communists are rediscovering basic ideas of
                            freedom already beyond the realm of exploratory debate in the West, and
                            which as such are ingrained elements in the outlook of the majority of
                            Hungarians. Cross satellite reporting has in the judgment of the
                            drafting officer<note n="9" xml:id="d200fn9">Anton Nyerges.</note> been
                            effectively handled. The sensational Polish events plus the more sober
                            Hungarian developments were handled in a manner that was well calculated
                            to support the indigenous pressures toward greater freedom. The
                            reporting of cultural life in the West has been good and has very likely
                            supported the cultural agitation which has marked the general
                            restiveness in Hungary in recent months.</p>

                            further in the direction, however, consideration should be given to two
                            factors: 1) people like Tibor Dery and Tibor Tardos,<note n="10"

                            undoubtedly gratified and influenced by Western interest in their

                            to their persons, then to their activities; 2) although the Hungarian
                            press has undoubtedly shown a trend toward liberalizing its publication

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> spoke with
                            considerable heat about the attacks against Radio Free Europe. He was
                            annoyed at the recent telegram from Bucharest which he said seemed to
                            accept the Communist line that <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> was
                            responsible for uprising and slaughter in Hungary and which he also said
                            carried with it a criticism of U.S. policy.<note n="2" xml:id="d201fn2"

                            luncheon period was taken up with the discussion of this item. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_JWH1">William Jackson</persName> and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> mentioned that
                            the President was concerned about reports that <gloss target="#t_RFE1"
                                >RFE</gloss> might have gone further than U.S. policy in some of its
                            broadcasts and suggested that the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>
                            take a look generally at the situation. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> said that he believed that
                            the existing procedure should be examined with <pb n="480"
                                xml:id="pg_480" facs="0510"/>respect to the carrying out of
                            political guidance to <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>. He said that
                            he was not an expert in these matters and did not know what the present
                            procedures were, but understood that there were so many broadcasts in so
                            many languages emanating from <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> that
                            it was impossible to screen them all in advance. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> said that he thought they
                            had a good system, but it was quite true that all scripts could not be
                            cleared in advance since timeliness was of the essence. He said that it
                            was not possible to be 100 percent sure in every case that the guidance
                            was being carried out, but he felt certain that it was. He said that
                            most of the people who had been critical of <gloss target="#t_RFE1"
                                >RFE</gloss> had yet to come up with a single bit of evidence in
                            support of their criticism. He felt that a more aggressive stance toward
                            the criticism should be taken. The point was made that since <gloss
                                target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> was a private organization, the
                            government could not very well jump to its defense without implying that
                                <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> was a government organization. .

                                rebellion; instead it has been the policy to keep the hope of
                                ultimate freedom alive and to encourage the captive people to seek

                            that it had not gotten any publicity in the press or otherwise and all
                            agreed that it was desirable to have the statement publicized although

                            <item>Recent developments in Poland and Hungary have brought to the fore
                                a basic problem of Soviet leadership—that of revising its system of
                                control over the Satellites. We believe that the Soviet leadership
                                    <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0513"/>is subject to
                                contradictory pressures on this problem, and is still undecided as
                                to the best solution. We cannot predict with confidence what course
                                will be adopted.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Given the vital character of the interests involved, the Soviet
                                leaders will not seriously consider abdicating their dominant
                                position in Eastern Europe. At the other end of the scale, a
                                full-blown return to the extremes of Stalinist rule is highly
                                unlikely. Thus, the major courses from which the Soviet leaders will
                                have to choose are likely to be the following: (A) a determined
                                policy of firm Soviet repression, but attempting to avoid the
                                extremes of Stalinism; (B) a systematic redefinition of
                                Soviet-Satellite relations based on lesser controls and anticipatory
                                concessions to nationalist sentiment; (C) continuation of the
                                present course of expediency, involving shifts between conciliation
                                and repression.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>For a considerable time at least, the Soviet leaders will probably
                                continue with Course C, which is essentially a postponement of clear
                                decision. It is possible that at any time the situation in Poland,
                                or a change in the Soviet leadership, will lead to a firm adoption
                                of Course A. We believe, however, that in the long run the forces at
                                work, both within and without the Soviet empire, will probably cause
                                the Soviet leaders to accept Course B as the basic pattern for their
                                relations with the Satellite countries.<note n="3" xml:id="d203fn3"

                                    that there is insufficient evidence available at present to
                                    warrant the estimate that “in the long run, the forces at work
                                    both within and without the Soviet empire” will cause the USSR
                                    to follow a policy of voluntarily loosening its control over the
                                    Satellites and using Poland as a model for the other East
                                    European Satellites. [Footnote in the source text.]</note>

                                control.</item>

                            <item>The current crisis in Soviet relations with Poland and Hungary is
                                a manifestation of the basic problem which has plagued the Soviet
                                leaders since the death of Stalin. They have sought, by repudiating
                                the extremes of Stalinism and relaxing terroristic controls, to gain
                                popular support and to stimulate party cadres and populations to
                                work more productively. At the same time, they have sought to insure
                                that this process would not lead to indiscipline and unacceptable
                                demands for reform. It was easier to satisfy both of these
                                conflicting goals in the USSR than in the Satellites, where
                                Communist authority was less securely established and where,
                                particularly in Hungary and Poland, Communist leaders had to contend
                                with traditions of intense nationalism and a rise in popular
                                expectations, particularly among the youth.</item>

                            <item>Soviet leaders evidently failed to recognize the strength of
                                anti-Soviet feeling within some of the Satellite Communist parties.
                                They do not seem to have foreseen that the reduction of terror and
                                the rehabilitation of Tito would not only stimulate intraparty
                                criticism but would also involve non-Communists and lead to the
                                expression of anti-Soviet and anti-Communist sentiments. This
                                process led to a breakdown of party unity in Hungary and Poland and
                                an acceleration of the reform movement to a point where Soviet
                                interests were endangered, acutely so in Hungary.</item>

                            <item>By the beginning of November, the USSR faced in Hungary a direct
                                choice between wholesale repression and the emergence of an
                                anti-Soviet, anti-Communist state. The latter would have seriously
                                weakened the Soviet strategic position in Eastern Europe, damaged
                                the prestige of the world Communist movement, and created an
                                unacceptable precedent for other Satellites. Under these
                                circumstances, we believe that the diversion provided by the attack
                                on Egypt, while convenient, did not affect the character or the
                                timing of the Soviet resort to military repression in

                            <item>In the immediate future, the USSR will face the bitter hostility
                                of the Hungarian people and the probability of considerable disorder

                                that a series of controlled reforms and cautious accommodations to

                            <item>Despite these contradictory pressures, there will almost certainly
                                be a consensus among the Soviet leaders that vital Soviet interests
                                demand preservation of Soviet hegemony in the Satellite area. They
                                will almost certainly continue to believe that the USSR’s military
                                security requires the forward deployment of Soviet forces there,
                                secure lines of communication to these forces, and utilization of
                                the area for Soviet air defense. Loss of control over the Satellites
                                might find Western power, including a revived Germany, pressing
                                against the Soviet frontiers. A defection of the area from the
                                “socialist camp” would also be seen as a major setback to the
                                Communist cause world wide, and would seriously compromise the
                                effectiveness of Soviet foreign policy in Asia and the Middle East.
                                Economic losses would be a factor of considerable, though not
                                critical importance.</item>

                            <item>Given the vital character of the interests involved, the Soviet
                                leaders will not seriously consider abdicating their dominant
                                position in Eastern Europe. At the other end of the scale, a
                                full-blown return to the extremes of Stalinist rule is highly
                                unlikely. Thus, the major courses of action from which the Soviet

                                difficulties are likely to be the following: <list>

                                of repression (Course A) or of further concessions (Course B).
                                Therefore, they are most likely to continue an indecisive course
                                (Course C). It is possible at any time that the situation in Poland
                                or a change within the Soviet leadership would lead to the adoption
                                of Course A. In the long run, the forces at work both within and
                                without the Soviet empire will probably cause the Soviet leaders to
                                accept Course B as the basic <pb n="490" xml:id="pg_490" facs="0520"

                                Satellites, and will attempt to strengthen Bloc economic ties. There
                                is also likely to be increased intra-bloc consultation on a wide
                                range of policy matters. However, any one of the alternative Soviet
                                policies will be confronted with serious practical problems. A
                                policy of conciliation will be handicapped in most Satellites by the
                                difficulty of keeping reform within prescribed limits. A program of
                                repression through puppet regimes will incur some of the
                                disadvantages of Stalinism and will be faced in many areas with the
                                acute problem of finding enough reliable and efficient indigenous
                                party administrators to conduct such a program. A policy of
                                continued improvisation between the two will suffer the
                                disadvantages of each and will encourage and exacerbate
                                intra-Communist friction. Thus over the long run, whatever path is
                                chosen by the USSR in dealing with its Satellites, it is not likely
                                to be able to create regimes which are stable and productive and at
                                the same time subject to close Soviet control.</item>

                                    Hungarian refugees be enlisted in the LSO in Germany in order to
                                    alleviate the refugee problem. Our Embassy in Bonn says that the
                                    Germans consider there are two possible drawbacks: (1) possible
                                    unfavorable propaganda, and (2) possible misuse of the
                                    organization by the Hungarians.<note n="3" xml:id="d204fn3"

                                        the LSO to refugees domiciled in the Federal Republic for at
                                        least a year so as to preclude a surge of refugees from

                                    to hold off for the time being but had an open mind on the
                                    subject.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Ernst said that the Defense Department was favorably disposed
                                    toward the idea. He understood that the German units in the LSO
                                    were being disbanded and the Hungarians could fill the gap.
                                    There were certain budgetary problems but these presumably could
                                    be met if we decided we wanted to do it. The possible drawbacks
                                    were valid points but the enlistment plan would not have to be
                                    widely publicized. The plan would appeal to Hungarian freedom
                                    fighters who wished to remain in Europe.</p>
                                <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CL1">Campbell</persName> suggested that
                                    the budgetary problem might be met by the German Army since
                                    Germany was taking a certain number of refugees anyway. Mr.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> mentioned that
                                    the idea was more provocative if carried out by the Germans. Mr.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_SJS1">Sutterlin</persName> said that
                                    if the objections had any validity, why proceed with the plan
                                    since the Federal Republic could find employment for refugees
                                    outside of the LSO. In reply to this Mr. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> said a telegram had been
                                    drafted <pb n="492" xml:id="pg_492" facs="0522"/>pointing out
                                    that an effort to find jobs in the German economy seemed
                                    preferable, also pointing out that since it was understood the
                                    LSO was being curtailed on budgetary grounds, Poles who were
                                    being discharged from it would resent the hiring of the
                                    Hungarians. The draft also pointed out the propaganda aspects,
                                    including the fact that the existence of Hungarian LSO units
                                    would give the Soviets an opportunity to claim the revolt had
                                    been inspired or supported by the U.S.</p>
                                <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Revey</persName> said that the
                                        <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> definitely felt the
                                    idea would result in a major propaganda loss and offered few
                                    gains to offset this loss. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJD1"
                                        >Beam</persName> said the Department was also inclined to
                                    think the idea might be more trouble than it was worth. He also
                                    pointed out that these recruits would be charged against the
                                    total number of refugees the Germans would admit.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Comstock mentioned two <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>

                                    provides that the LSO be expanded by 1,000 places of which at
                                    least 500 were to be former Soviet citizens. It was established
                                        <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policy to increase the
                                    LSO. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CL1">Campbell</persName> and Mr.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> mentioned that
                                    they had heard that other elements of the German Government
                                    would not go along with the Foreign Office’s support for the

                                <p>At this point Mr. Boerner entered and said he thought the whole
                                    idea was “terrible.” With reference to the <gloss
                                        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper, he contrasted it to the
                                    recent statement by the President that we did not want to make
                                    military allies of the Hungarians.<note n="6" xml:id="d204fn6"
                                        >See <ref target="#d149">Document 149</ref>.</note> This was
                                    followed by a discussion whether the LSO was a para-military
                                    organization. Replying to Mr. Boerner’s statement that the plan
                                    seemed to confirm those who claimed that we were stirring up
                                    trouble, Colonel Schaaf said he was not sure that was entirely
                                    bad. Mr. Cox mentioned that Mr. Voorhees had stated in a meeting
                                    at the White House that our public posture on the question was
                                    to be completely humanitarian. He also said that his information
                                    was that the suggestion had originally come from <gloss
                                        target="#t_USAREUR1">USAREUR</gloss>, not the Germans.
                                    Referring to the pressure to expand the LSO, Mr. Collins
                                    suggested that this had arisen when there was an over-supply of
                                    labor in West Germany contrary to the present situation. Mr.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> suggested that
                                    the State Department go ahead and draft a telegram turning down
                                    the idea and that the views of Defense should be obtained.
                                    Colonel Schaaf said Defense was not disposed to make an issue of
                                    it but asked whether the decision could be deferred. Mr.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> said not more
                                    than about a week. The Department would <pb n="493"

                                    the Army Department. Mr. Comstock mentioned that it should go to
                                    the Secretary of Defense’s office.<note n="7" xml:id="d204fn7"
                                        >The <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> took up the
                                        question on December 19. Gordon Gray informed <persName
                                            corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> that the Department
                                        of Defense favored the project. The Acting Secretary, for
                                        his part, pointed out the various reasons why the Department
                                        of State found the proposal inadvisable. A decision was made

                                    willingness to go to Budapest. (A/PV.586, p. 170) On November
                                    27, he received a letter from the Hungarian Foreign Minister,
                                    which indicated that Hungary was giving serious consideration to
                                    his visit. In light of the resolutions passed on November 21,

                                    November 28 asked the Hungarian and Soviet Delegations to
                                    comment on the admission of observers since he had to report on
                                    that matter to the Assembly. He also raised the question of his
                                    trip to Budapest. The Soviet reply, dated November 29, concluded
                                    that “allegations of the deportation of Hungarian citizens to
                                    the USSR are based on slanderous rumours circulated by certain
                                    groups for the purpose of misleading public opinion.” The Soviet
                                    answer was incorporated as an Annex to “Implementation of the

                                A group already appointed was examining material but it was
                                essential to get direct observation. At this stage the Secretary
                                General was merely drawing attention to the need of observers going
                                to Hungary. This need would be more relevant as the investigation
                                proceeded. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> said the
                                Department had been canvassing delegations on the possibility of
                                another resolution requesting the observers to go to Europe, where
                                governments which could do so would help them in their task by
                                supplying information. A later resolution was being considered to
                                condemn the Soviets and Hungary for non-compliance with <gloss
                                    target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions on troop withdrawals and
                                deportations. It was not desired to put this resolution forward now
                                for fear of inspiring a condemnatory resolution against the British
                                and the French. Our <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> delegation, he
                                said, thinks this is as far as it is possible to go in the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> at present. Mr. Cox inquired whether
                                the Secretary General needed a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                resolution to decide to send the observers to Europe, to which Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> said that he did not
                                but that such a resolution would strengthen his hand. The idea had
                                been suggested to him, although the Indian member of the observers’
                                group did not want to go to Europe unless the group was admitted to
                                Hungary. Mr. Cox mentioned the <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>

                                the statement merely mentioned “the most expeditious means.” Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SJS1">Sutterlin</persName> inquired
                                whether it would apply only to refugees in Austria, to which Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_FEL1">Freers</persName> answered that it
                                would not jeopardize chances of those elsewhere. Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_FEL1">Freers</persName> mentioned a suggestion that,
                                since the Hungrian Olympic team was returning home through the U.S.,
                                a track meet be held in the U.S. for the benefit of the refugees.
                                This presented problems whether the athletes were for or against the

                                who had recently returned from the Legation at Budapest, was asked

                                Hungarians had inferred that if they rebelled the <gloss

                                arms and ammunition. Some were bitter, others merely discouraged,
                                the general attitude was in-between. This, he said, was based on
                                conversations with Hungarians by members of the Legation staff who
                                could speak Hungarian. Mr. Cox mentioned that he had met these same
                                people in Munich last August and that they were not critical of
                                    <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> then. Mr. Clark said that
                                the Hungarian disappointment arose from a general feeling that since
                                we were fostering liberty we would help the revolt. Mr. Cox said
                                that this seemed to mean that the problem arose from the whole
                                public posture of the U.S., and Mr. Boerner inquired whether it was
                                wrong to foster liberty. Mr. Clark said no but some bitter remarks
                                were being made. Colonel Schaaf said that this seemed to be more
                                because of the fact that we were ineffective than because of
                                anything <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> had broadcast.</item>

                                    outbreak of brutality in Hungary has moved free peoples
                                    everywhere to reactions of horror and revulsion. Our hearts are

                                He asked the committee’s opinion whether the proclamation’s
                                references to Hungary could be considered inflammatory. Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BRO1">Blake</persName> said he thought it
                                was not inflammatory but that he thought one phrase looked a little
                                bit like urging the Hungarians to keep on fighting. . . . Mr. Cox
                                said the broadcasting of the proclamation by the <gloss
                                    target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> would raise the same policy

                                broadcasts. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CL1">Campbell</persName>
                                mentioned that the policy is to maintain pressure against the USSR
                                on the Hungarian question in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                and elsewhere. . . . Colonel Schaaf expressed the view that the
                                proclamation would certainly not incite the Hungarians to revolt.
                                The discussion concluded with the decision that certain phrases
                                should be deleted from the draft.</item>

                                <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> said he thought
                                    that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Fact-Finding Group
                                    might well activate itself now and appeal to the nations of the
                                    world for material on the Hungarian situation, for example, from
                                    diplomatic reports from Budapest. Straightforward, objective,
                                    eye-witness accounts were desired. In answer to a question from
                                    Mr. Cox, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> said
                                    that the function of the observers was to get material and for
                                    the fact-finders to interpret it. There was a possibility that
                                    the observers might soon go to Europe, but the Austrian
                                    Government was getting cold feet about admitting them. Mr. Cox
                                    asked why, in view of the fact they had taken a rather hard line
                                    against accusations they were violating their neutrality. Mr.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> said it was
                                    possible the observers might still be admitted to Austria. Mr.
                                    Ernst said that Austria should not be allowed to overrule the
                                        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on considerations of

                                    from the beginning made it clear that they did not want the
                                    observers to come to Austria if they were not going on to
                                        Hungary.<note n="5" xml:id="d205fn5">On December 8, Austria
                                        informed the Secretary-General of its willingness to admit

                                <p>Reverting to the question of the credentials of the Hungarian
                                    delegation, Mr. Cox inquired why we were not going further and
                                    pressing for outright expulsion of the delegation. Mr. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> said that it was desirable
                                    to have Hungarian representatives there to hear the speeches and
                                    resolutions made on the subject; Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRO1"
                                        >Blake</persName> said that if the delegation was expelled
                                    the Hungarian Government would give even less cooperation to the
                                        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>; and Mr. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_FEL1">Freers</persName> said that the logical
                                    next step would be a breaking of diplomatic relations which was
                                    undesirable, especially since we needed to keep our Legation in
                                    Budapest. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> added
                                    that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> itself was dealing
                                    with the <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> Government
                                    on the question of relief. Colonel Schaaf questioned whether all
                                    this offsets the desirability of disciplining the Hungarian
                                    Government for its defiance of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                        >UN</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRO1"
                                        >Blake</persName> mentioned that a logical implication of
                                    expelling the present Hungarian Government from the <gloss
                                        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would also be the expulsion of
                                    the USSR. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CL1">Campbell</persName>
                                    mentioned that failure to expel the present Hungarian Government
                                    undermined our arguments against the admission of Red China. Mr.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Revey</persName> said we might
                                    want to lift the suspension some time—how and when would we do
                                    it? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> said that it
                                    could be done if they admitted the observers. Mr. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_CL1">Campbell</persName> said that more than
                                    that would be required after a condemnatory resolution. Mr. Cox
                                    said that he thought expelling the <persName corresp="#p_KJ1"
                                        >Kadar</persName> Government’s representatives would be a
                                    blow to the Soviet Union which was the real culprit. Colonel
                                    Schaaf asked whether, if the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                    expelled the Hungarian representatives, this necessarily meant
                                    that Hungary would break diplomatic relations with the U.S. Mr.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_BRO1">Blake</persName> inquired
                                    whether it was thought that expulsion would really help
                                    anything, to which Mr. Cox replied he thought so since Hungarian
                                    refugees were of the opinion that the <persName corresp="#p_KJ1"
                                        >Kadar</persName> Government should not be

                                    target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper called for action in the
                                    <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and elsewhere, whereas this
                                draft referred only to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action. Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> agreed that the
                                draft should be reworded to take care of this discrepancy. Colonel
                                Schaaf inquired whether this was to <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498"
                                    facs="0528"/>be a report or an outline plan of operations to
                                which the reply was that it was the former. With reference to the
                                question of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action, Mr. Ernst
                                inquired how much support would be forthcoming in the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> for a resolution ordering the
                                Secretary-General to present himself at the Hungarian border or to
                                fly directly into Budapest with advance notice he was coming. Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> said there would not
                                be many votes for such a resolution.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>On Para. 16b, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CL1">Campbell</persName> raised
                            several questions, inquiring whether anything in the Hungarian Peace
                            Treaty gave us the right to take any action in view of the absence of
                            law and order. He also said that evolutionary measures would not bring
                            about free elections and that the paper might make that comment. In
                            reply Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRO1">Blake</persName> said that we have
                            pressed for free elections ever since 1945 without thinking that our
                            urging would actually produce such elections and that we shouldn’t stop
                            now. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> said that the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> Government had indicated
                            it would agree to some kind of elections but that “anti-Socialists”
                            would be excluded. He thought that the paper might include references to
                            the peace treaty provisions for free elections. He then asked for
                            comments on Para. 16c(1) concerning a possible embargo. Mr. Comstock
                            said the paper seemed to be saying that the Battle Act was not effective
                            but asked whether this had been cleared with the Department’s economic
                            people. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FEL1">Freers</persName> said it had
                            not been. Mr. Ernst said that even if the effects of the embargo were
                            limited it would create some difficulties for the Soviets to which Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BRO1">Blake</persName> said that the balance
                            of difficulties might be in the other direction. Mr. Comstock said that
                            the vital point was that general participation could not be counted on.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> said he would have the
                            Department’s economists go into this paragraph.</p>
                        <p>On Para. 16c(2), a new discussion arose over the desirability of
                            expelling the <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> Government’s
                            representatives from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CL1">Campbell</persName> said he thought we
                            were all agreed that relations should not be broken with the USSR but
                            that they might be broken with the <persName corresp="#p_KJ1"
                                >Kadar</persName> Government. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJD1"
                                >Beam</persName> said he thought the State Department disagreed with
                            him there. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TH1">Trivers</persName> suggested
                            that the right of the <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName>
                            Government’s representatives to vote and speak in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> might be suspended. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> said that he thought this might be
                            involved in the suspension of credentials. He furthermore said he
                            thought the <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> regime, bad as
                            it was, wanted to get the Russians off its neck and this purpose would
                            not be served by such a rupture. Colonel Schaaf asked whether the
                            expulsion of the Hungarians might not serve as a warning to the Soviets
                            that it could also happen to them, to which Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> answered in the negative. Colonel
                            Schaaf again made the point that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            loses prestige if its members defy it. Mr. Cox said that for a long time
                            the U.S. had maintained diplomatic relations with Hungary but had voted
                            against its admission to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, <pb
                                n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0529"/>why then should Hungary’s
                            expulsion from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> entail a rupture of
                            relations with the U.S.? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FEL1"
                                >Freers</persName> said that it was a political judgment that this
                            was likely to happen in view of the evident fact that the present
                            Hungarian government would like to get rid of our Legation in Budapest.
                            Colonel Schaaf and Mr. Cox expressed doubt whether the presence of the
                            Legation in Hungary was any deterrent to the Soviets or the <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> regime. Others present disagreed
                            with this opinion. (At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJD1"
                                >Beam</persName> left and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FEL1"
                                >Freers</persName> took the chair).</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ernst commented that Para. 16c(2) seemed to come down too heavily on
                            the repercussions of severance of diplomatic relations. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FEL1">Freers</persName> replied that the reference to
                            severance of diplomatic relations was a general one and that severance
                            with the USSR now would be an extreme action. He said, however, that the
                            wording could be softened.</p>
                        <p>There was still another discussion on the desirability of expelling the
                            Hungarian <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> representatives, with Mr.
                            Cox doubting whether this would lead to the expulsion of our Legation
                            from Budapest or that the presence of our Legation there served as a
                            deterrent to the Soviets. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FEL1"
                                >Freers</persName> said that it would be necessary to check on what
                            the suspension of credentials involved and whether or not it suspended
                            the right to vote.</p>
                        <p>On Para. 17 Mr. Cox said he disagreed with the policy assumption implicit
                            in the statement that a demand for Hungarian neutrality would lead to a
                            Soviet demand for the withdrawal of American troops from Western Europe.
                            He said he thought the proposed courses of action should not be
                            influenced by counter-proposals the Soviets might make. After some
                            discussion this sentence was deleted and it was agreed to substitute one
                            to the effect that the chances of obtaining Hungarian neutrality were to
                            be explored through <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or diplomatic
                            channels.</p>
                        <p>On Para. 18 Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CL1">Campbell</persName> said that
                            we should not talk about economic aid to Hungary now until the
                            conditions of Soviet withdrawal and free elections had been fulfilled.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FEL1">Freers</persName> said there was some
                            advantage to involving <gloss target="#t_ECE1">ECE</gloss>, a <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> organ, in economic aid since this would
                            be more acceptable to the Soviets. After discussion it was agreed to
                            leave sub-paragraph ii out and make sub-paragraph iii conditional on
                            fulfillment of sub-paragraph i.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Schaaf once again urged the desirability of expelling the
                            Hungarian representatives from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and
                            after another brief discussion on this the meeting closed.</p>

                        <p>The Hungarian Government informed the Secretary-General the next day that
                            “permission for United Nations observers to enter the territory of
                            Hungary would violate the sovereignty of Hungary and would be contrary
                            to the principles of the United Nations Charter.” It welcomed the
                            opportunity, however, for negotiations with him in Rome or New York
                            where he would “get satisfactory personal information of the situation
                            in Hungary” and it held out the possibility of direct negotiations in
                            Budapest “at a later date appropriate for both parties.” (A/3414)
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> described this
                            offer as “most unsatisfactory.” Speaking on December 3, <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> emphasized the need for
                            information gathered by “impartial observers on the scene.” In support
                            of the 14-power draft resolution, he asserted “we are confronted by a
                            demonstration of complete contempt for the provisions of the charter and
                            a callous disregard for human decency. It certainly cannot be said that
                            we have proceeded too hastily or that we have not given the Soviet Union
                            and the Hungarian authorities every opportunity to abide by their
                            obligations as members of the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>“The time has come for one final appeal, but we must set a deadline—a
                            terminal date—for their response. We cannot permit ourselves to be
                            fobbed off, to be stalled. We cannot permit the urgent recommendations
                            of the General Assembly to be utterly disregarded.” (A/PV.604, pages

                        <pb n="501" xml:id="pg_501" facs="0531"/>
                        <p>At the seventh meeting of the United States Delegation on the morning of
                            December 4, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WJJ1">Wadsworth</persName>
                            raised the question of the December 7 deadline incorporated in draft
                            resolution A/3413. He suggested that “if we said to the Soviets ‘you do

                            It was the sense of the delegation that the Department of State be asked
                            “to examine the potential effects of sanctions” if the deadline was not

                        <p>The Assembly met three times on December 4 to consider the 14-power draft
                            resolution. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName> announced
                            that as a result of a meeting he held with <persName corresp="#p_HI1"
                                >Horvath</persName> after the second session the Hungarian
                            Representative would suggest to his government that the
                            Secretary-General be welcomed to Budapest on December 16. To prepare the
                            way, <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName> designated the
                            United Nations Under-Secretary in charge of the Department of Economic
                            and Social Affairs, Philippe de Seynes, to proceed to Hungary one week
                            ahead of him. Resolution 1130(XI) was adopted shortly thereafter by a
                            vote of 54 to 10 (Hungary and the Soviet Union), with 14 abstentions.
                            (A/PV.608) That same evening, Dragon Protitch, Under-Secretary for
                            Political and Security Council Affairs, told William Saunders of the
                            United States Delegation that it had “been a mistake to rely so heavily
                            on the Secretary-General in the Hungarian situation. He said the
                            Assembly should have created its own committee of observers or
                            investigators.</p>
                        <p>“He said that it was one thing to rely on the Secretary-General in a case
                            such as the Middle East where the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> was
                            dealing with decent people subjected to public opinion pressures and
                            another thing to rely on him in a situation such as the Hungarian
                            involving the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>“He asked what one could expect, for example, for the Secretary-General
                            to do if he were permitted to go to Hungary. Even if he was able to
                            obtain information from <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName>
                            himself, he obviously would find it very difficult to use it without
                            compromising his ‘neutral’ position.” (Memorandum of conversation by
                            Saunders, US/A/UNNO, December 4; Department of State, IO Files)</p>
                        <p>On December 12, the Hungarian Government informed the Secretary-General
                            that December 16 was not an appropriate date for a visit by him. It
                            promised to “set forth a proposal” on this matter “at a later date.”

                                    been a grave mistake since it meant we lost all chance of

                            stated that the President had given clear-cut instructions that
                            everything possible should be done. In spite of this, it appeared that
                            nothing was being done. In his view, the Embassy had transmitted a
                            request from the Poles for aid. The President had said “give aid”; yet
                            the matter was being stalled by technicalities. The Chairman replied
                            that the matter was more complicated than it might appear. There were
                            problems such as the Battle Act. Certain legal findings would be
                            required before aid could be extended. Decisions in this matter were not
                            the sole responsibility of State but would require concurrence of
                            various agencies. The U.S. was actively discussing the matter with the
                            Polish Government, but the Polish Foreign Office was not being
                            completely helpful because it is under Russian domination. Mr. <persName

                            consider that he had received a clear-cut request for aid from the
                            Polish Government and that until this was received he could not proceed.
                            He felt that the telegram from the Embassy was not adequate.<note n="2"

                            would have to be careful determination as to the source of funds. He
                            questioned the possibility of the use of the special Presidential fund.
                            In any case, commitments in connection with Hungarian refugees had

                        <p>The Chairman suggested that it might be helpful to have a report prepared

                                indicate that it is in our national interest for these commodities
                                to be exported for dollars at world market prices.” The prompt
                                approval of the Council on Foreign Economic Policy was sought. (<hi

                        <p>Joint State–<gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> Message. For Personal
                            Attention Chief of Mission and Principal Officer. It has been reported
                            by some of our Missions that especially in Western Europe there has been
                            a lack of understanding by Governments, the press, and the general
                            community regarding United States reaction to the recent events in
                            Hungary. This is said to include an underestimation of the United States
                            efforts in the United Nations and elsewhere to prevent or end the Soviet
                            suppression and violence directed against the Hungarian people. It has
                            been suggested that the United States was so preoccupied with events in
                            the Middle East that it failed to grasp the significance of developments
                            in Hungary. It would be appreciated if Chiefs of Mission and Principal
                            Officers would give this matter their personal attention and this should
                            be supplemented by efforts on the part of other members of the <pb
                                n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0537"/>staff, especially the Public
                            Affairs officers and <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>
                            representatives, to get across the story of the vigorous reaction of
                            your Government and the substantial efforts it has made incident to
                            tragic events in Hungary.</p>
                        <p>It should be remembered, of course, that events in Hungary happened with
                            extraordinary speed, symptomatic of spontaneous public upheavals, but
                            throughout the development we remained in as close touch with the
                            situation as was humanly possible to do.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows a summary of United States actions in the Hungarian
                            situation.]</p>
                        <p>Chiefs of Mission, Principal Officers and their staffs, of course, should
                            work closely with <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> in keeping this
                            information, as well as future actions and statements by the United
                            States Government on the developing Hungarian situation, before the
                            public. In this task, all media should be used and where practical,
                            special reviews or roundups should be developed and exploited. In close
                            collaboration with the posts, <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>
                            should make appropriate contacts with government officials, leaders of
                            public opinion, press and other media people to ensure that the widest
                            possible audience get a clearer picture of the attitudes and actions of
                            the American people and the American Government towards the situation in
                            Hungary.</p>
                        <p>It is realized, of course, that there are many countries where the
                            problems here set forth do not exist. There are also, no doubt,
                            situations where official and public attitudes will militate against
                            full exploitation of the United States position. It is left to the
                            discretion of the Chiefs of Mission, Principal Officers, and <gloss
                                target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> representatives how the situations in
                            the various countries can best be met.</p>
                        <p>The following should be implicit in efforts to publicize and create an
                            understanding of the United States role in the Hungarian situation: <list>

                                >UN</gloss> condemning alleged American intervention in Hungary by

                                xml:id="d210fn2">Reference is to the “Complaint by the Union of

                                assigned to the Special Political Committee “for consideration and

                            Kuznetsov on Hungary, which began with Kuznetsov’s remark at the end of
                            a conversation on Security Council enlargement:<note n="2"

                                    >Humphrey</persName> emphasized that he was speaking as an
                                individual and not as a representative of the U.S. Government, and
                                Kuznetsov stressed that his comments were unofficial. (<gloss

                        <p>Kuznetsov said he was not very pleased things had turned out this way
                            between our two countries. He had spent a couple of years in the United
                            States in the 1930’s and had met lots of people—scientists, workers,
                            etc. He had the highest respect for American people. There were no
                            reasons for the USSR and the US not to be friendly. This was a problem
                            we would have to work on.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said there was much good
                            will among American people for the people of the USSR. Recent visits and
                            exchanges of delegations had shown this. It was unfortunate that recent
                            events had disrupted progress toward more friendly relations. Perhaps
                            Kuznetsov had noted friendly comment about the USSR in the US press
                            until <pb n="510" xml:id="pg_510" facs="0540"/>recently. Unfortunately
                            the situation in Central Europe needed to be reconciled. He had a
                            feeling that maybe there was some desire on the part of others that this
                            was also the case.</p>
                        <p>Kuznetsov said the USSR was also not happy about the situation in Europe.
                            Many problems might be solved if there were certain approach and desire
                            to reach solutions. He recognized there were different approaches and
                            opinions about these questions. This should not stop us from talking and
                            meeting about them. Maybe we could reach something. If we did not meet
                            we could never understand one another and get closer. It was a tragedy
                            there was so little exchange of opinions. Some people wanted a divided
                            world but the world could not be divided now. This was impossible. The
                            US and the USSR must fight against this.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that
                            problems had to be met in a spirit of responsibility. He pointed out
                            that he was a member of opposition party and did not share many of
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s views on
                            domestic policy. But the President was a man of peace. He had shown this
                            by his actions and his willingness to sit around the table with the
                            Soviets last year.<note n="3" xml:id="d211fn3">At Geneva in July
                                1955.</note></p>
                        <p>Kuznetsov said the USSR had the highest respect for <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>. He was very popular in the
                            USSR among the people themselves. The slightest step of the US
                            officially or unofficially, “I assure you”, toward better understanding
                            of situations or expanding of relations will be met with sincere desire
                            on the part of the Soviet people. We would do our utmost to meet this.
                            Unfortunately some developments have prevented this.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that tragic
                            developments in Hungary had had much to do with this. He was talking now
                            not as a representative of the Government but as a citizen of the United
                            States, and as a Senator. He was not unmindful that the USSR was
                            concerned about friendly states on its borders. There had been a year
                            and a half of progress on better relations between the US and the USSR,
                            including advancements on peaceful uses of atomic energy, exchanges of
                            scientists and students. Then came the Hungarian tragedy. He can’t help
                            believe there must be some who want to get this resolved. This cannot be
                            done by force on either side. Hungarian people have to have a
                            responsible Government; they have to live. Great responsibilities rest
                            on our two countries on such problems.</p>
                        <p>Kuznetsov said he was glad <persName corresp="#p_HGM1"
                                >Humphrey</persName> had touched on this question. Maybe there was
                            not enough time to discuss it in detail but he was glad to give some
                            opinions. In a short time he could not say much but he would give brief
                            comments. With respect to the previous situation in Hungary and
                            concerning present Hungarian events, he thought <pb n="511"
                                xml:id="pg_511" facs="0541"/>the question had to be looked at from
                            several sides. The problem was difficult, complicated and delicate.
                            General Assembly discussion showed delegations accusing the USSR would
                            not listen to other sides of the question. It was like a discussion of
                            deaf people who would not listen to each other. If we analyze the
                            preceding situation in Hungary and subsequent events we can then try to
                            find certain recommendations which would be useful, to the Hungarian
                            people first of all. The matter was not so simple as some people made
                            out. It happened that the US and the USSR were most active on this
                            question. The US put it before General Assembly at least once a week or
                            sometimes less. Perhaps some other delegations were glad that USSR and
                            US relations were becoming more severe; they want to put us more apart.
                            They try to play on this and put both delegations on the spot. I am glad
                            you touched on this. It would be a good idea to find time to discuss it
                            further without an official meeting and records.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said he thought this
                            might do a great deal of good. He was the type of person who wanted to
                            seek answers rather than headlines. You had said this was a difficult
                            problem and it is. You do understand that the American people are very
                            much concerned about the Hungarian situation. There is considerable
                            friendship among the American people and the Soviet people. This can be
                            destroyed by the failures of their Governments. If we cannot handle a
                            problem such as that in Hungary, what would happen if the situation
                            broke out in Germany? (Kuznetsov exclaimed “yes, yes”). <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said he was Chairman of the
                            Senate Subcommittee on Disarmament. Disarmament Committee had handled
                            every USSR proposal seriously. We had looked into every means for
                            approach to disarmament. At least there might be some approach if only
                            on a piecemeal basis. Kuznetsov said we have to start somewhere. Maybe
                            we can start on small things.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said maybe unofficial
                            conversations on the Hungarian situation might help in relations. At
                            least we could put forward views to each other on a quiet basis.
                            Kuznetsov said he would appreciate conversations on this and also on
                            disarmament. <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said there
                            was some chance of making advances on disarmament. Kuznetsov said they
                            also thought we might get something, even at this session. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said the disarmament problem
                            was much conditioned by a solution to the Middle Eastern and Central
                            European questions.</p>
                        <p>Kuznetsov said in international affairs he recognized that all questions
                            were linked together but he thought a start could be made on some
                            without others. Many political problems would have to wait for a
                            considerable time for solution. But if we put them together this would
                            put progress on disarmament in a difficult position. He did not think,
                            for example, that the German problem could be solved very soon, at least
                            not this year. But we could do something right away on disarmament. We
                            should not wait for a solution of other international <pb n="512"
                                xml:id="pg_512" facs="0542"/>problems. We must break the vicious
                            circle. If people want to delay they can always find reasons. To swim
                            one must start sometime and jump into water. You could talk about
                            swimming for a long time and never learn. You have to jump.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that that was true
                            but you also sometimes had to know how deep the water was and how cold.
                            He regretted that sometimes we got to the point where we could not
                            visit. Maybe we could get together again on an informal basis as well as
                            on official business (referring to the enlargement of the Security
                            Council). He wanted Kuznetsov to know that any move the USSR made to
                            rectify the situation in Hungary without endangering Soviet security
                            would be a great relief to the people of the world. People were looking
                            for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to work reasonably well, and
                            whether the great powers would uphold the Charter. I really feel when
                            the USSR violates the Charter it is of benefit to the USSR and everyone
                            for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to do something about it. We
                            may disagree on many questions, but in the Senate we often hope to
                            disagree without being disagreeable. Kuznetsov said he understood.</p>
                        <p>Kuznetsov said the USSR wants to solve the Hungarian problem. This
                            depended not only on the USSR. Others could make a contribution. One of
                            the things to do was to bring a stop to interference. There was
                            considerable propaganda and groups of people who wanted to intervene.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said, “Do you really
                            believe that type of thing you speak of made that much difference in
                            Hungary?”</p>
                        <p>Kuznetsov said he could not speak of details, but take the radio station
                            of Free Europe. He could not repeat many things they had said but they
                            had been broadcasting day and night and had instigated people to take
                            hostile position toward the present regimes. Take for example the
                            hundred million dollars and additional money Congress had allocated for
                            subversive activities.<note n="4" xml:id="d211fn4">Reference is to the

                            USSR. The USSR distinguished between official policy and attitudes of
                            people. Some actions of the US Government showed the USSR must deal with
                            another point of view from that of the people, a view which was a
                            hostile attitude toward the USSR and people’s democracies. Maybe he was
                            mistaken. Maybe the US did not intend to change the system and
                            “liberate” people from the “communist yoke”.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said he had not quite
                            realized that we were as successful as Kuznetsov seemed to think. He
                            also pointed out that as far as the hundred million dollars was
                            concerned much of it had never even <pb n="513" xml:id="pg_513"
                                facs="0543"/>been spent. He said the problem of Hungary was serious
                            and that something had to be done about it. Other problems had been
                            settled including that of the Berlin Airlift.</p>
                        <p>Kuznetsov said we are not happy about Hungarian situation. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> noted that not only had some
                            problems been settled through <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> but
                            India had helped on some problems such as China,<note n="5"

                            Kuznetsov said yes sometimes individuals could help very much.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said USSR had lost great
                            good will in US overnight. President had been building good will between
                            Soviet and American peoples in sense that he was restrained in attitude
                            and an agent of peace and understanding. This all went down the drain
                            with the Hungarian situation. It would be of advantage to both to see a
                            change.</p>
                        <p>Kuznetsov said USSR appreciated position of the President on some
                            problems. These were sincere feelings of himself and Soviet people. Some
                            problems and actions had created unhappy feelings. Many things needed to
                            be discussed unofficially and frankly. Recently US had officially
                            cancelled program for exchange of technical and cultural delegations.
                            Maybe this was due to the influence of some groups but it was not a
                            friendly step. Take US position on foreign trade of USSR. USSR had shown
                            it could live and do quite well without foreign trade but the way US
                            considers and announces its attitude toward trade relations creates
                            unhappy feelings. Closer trade relations would be better for both
                            countries. I was in the iron and steel business before I became a
                            diplomat and I know you are ahead of us on these matters. Still we are
                            doing something. Perhaps we can learn from each other. I have been to
                            China and you might say it is very backward, but I found it is still
                            possible to learn something from them, even in questions of industry.
                            China had some very backward installations, old blast furnaces that you
                            see only in text books. Still they had the most modern equipment also.
                            When one nation separates itself from others this is not good.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said US certainly did not
                            want to isolate itself. There had been many references to an iron
                            curtain, both coming in and going out. There had been slight opening of
                            this and US had wanted it open even more. This went pretty well until
                            recently. The closing off of exchanges took place because you did
                            something. This was in response to something for which the American
                            people held the USSR responsible.</p>
                        <p>Kuznetsov said that general attitude in USSR after war was that US policy
                            was to isolate it, that we did not want to develop economic relations,
                            expand trade, exchange experiences. We have been trying <pb n="514"
                                xml:id="pg_514" facs="0544"/>utmost in last few years to bring
                            people to USSR. We had allowed congressmen and senators to come and even
                                Hearst.<note n="6" xml:id="d211fn6">Newspaper editor William

                            but we continued to allow them to come. We made some steps and we expect
                            the same from the US.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said these exchanges were
                            going quite well but this new problem had now arisen. Kuznetsov said he
                            regarded important part his function in General Assembly to explain to
                            American people real policy of USSR. He said US press gave greatly
                            distorted view of USSR and that attitude toward it had become more
                            hostile in recent months. <persName corresp="#p_HGM1"
                                >Humphrey</persName> said he sort of had impression USSR press gave
                            pretty bad picture of US. Kuznetsov replied immediately not nearly so
                            bad as US press of USSR (he gave an impression of sincerity on this
                            point and was joined spontaneously by his adviser with a similar
                            remark). Kuznetsov said he had noticed big difference in US press
                            attitude between this year and last, that it was more hostile than
                            before. He said US press makes USSR look like “horror”. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said we should deal with these
                            problems as fellow human beings. He thought it was urgent responsibility
                            of USSR to do something about Central Europe. He did not speak as judge.
                            He simply felt that sometimes certain countries, like individuals, could
                            be irresponsible but at least two countries have greater
                            responsibilities than others—US and USSR. Kuznetsov said you are right
                            there. <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said he hoped we
                            were never too proud to talk with you. Kuznetsov said we should talk
                            more.</p>
                        <p>As we were going toward the door, <persName corresp="#p_HGM1"
                                >Humphrey</persName> said he had been interested in proposal that
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> visit Moscow because he thought
                            this might help find way to solve the Hungarian problem. He asked
                            Kuznetsov what his feeling was. Kuznetsov said (with feeling) this was
                            “wrongest” thing that could be done. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
                            was always welcome in Moscow but not on this question. <persName

                            future and long-term economic problems, following some thoughts course
                            US should endeavor follow here in coming months.</p>
                        <p>Thus far unable discern in Soviet actions any indication of future policy
                            other than probable complete domination of Hungarian puppet government.
                            (In time, this domination would be increasingly indirect.) Dramatic
                            developments here and Poland, however, give evidence deep current
                            anti-Soviet feeling, which will continue and potentialities of which
                            perhaps greater than previously realized. Despite military control, this
                            current can have intense eroding effect on all Soviet efforts at
                            political and ideological control. Furthermore, possible that attitude
                            non-Soviet world can, over period time, have greater effect than evident
                            thus far.</p>
                        <p>Believe two areas where US role can perhaps be positive: Search for
                            eventual political compromise reduce present weight Soviet repression,
                            and consideration grant economic assistance beyond $20 million.<note

                        <p>On political side, while attainment free Hungary must remain our basic
                            objective, clear that we should give serious consideration to effort
                            achieve short-term lesser aims, attainment of which would set stage for
                            next step. Problem facing West at present is attainment some concession
                            from Soviets in Hungary despite their continuing unwillingness
                            compromise basic strategic position. Thus, appears from here most
                            unlikely Soviets near future will accept any compromise involving troop
                            removal. To Soviets dangers already demonstrated in nationalistic
                            Communist such as Nagy so large as argue strongly against their present
                            acceptance any leader not clearly under their control. However, one
                            reason for Soviet fear Nagy in past, and this fear certainly
                            strengthened in recent weeks, has probably been unclear picture in
                            Soviet mind re Western plans or desiderata with regard free Hungary.
                            Soviets may in fact be victims own propaganda and we know many
                            Hungarians (including allegedly Anna Kethly) have in past voiced similar
                            doubts. Need for public clarification US position this regard had been
                            felt prior revolution and Legation had intended raise question with

                            aware, Legation prior to revolution believed Soviets had probably given

                        <p>Concerning economic assistance, now very clear that despite all relief
                            activities, real and continuing suffering can be minimized only by
                            fairly large-scale assistance in foodstuffs and fuel, for which payment
                            cannot be made in immediate future. Recent Hungarian history
                            demonstrates that West’s interests do not run counter economic welfare
                            individual Hungarians. Anti-Soviet feeling (or at least outward
                            expression that feeling) has increased, not decreased as standard living
                            rose slightly recent years and each economic concession by Communist
                            government has been answered by greater demands. Perhaps most important
                            criteria in deciding such aid would be whether actually benefits
                            individual Hungarian and whether he aware it came from US. I therefore
                            increasingly favor some effort provide Hungary considerable assistance
                            in foodstuffs and fuel in coming months.</p>

                        <p>The need for such clarification arises from the criticisms that have been
                            voiced in the American and foreign press, alleging that <gloss
                                target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> has incited the Hungarian patriots to
                            revolt by promising outside assistance which could not be, and was not,
                            made available.</p>
                        <p>The President, in his statement of November 14,<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d213fn3">See <ref target="#d185fn3">footnote 3, Document
                                    185</ref>.</note> made clear that “the United States doesn’t
                            now, and never has, advocated open rebellion by an undefended populace
                            against force over which they could not possibly prevail”. This
                            statement was helpful in offsetting similar criticisms that have been
                            made with respect to the broadcasts on the Government’s official radio,
                            the Voice of America. However, the President’s statement does not cover
                                <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> broadcasts, which cannot
                            publicly be related to United States policy because our public position
                            toward <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> is that it is a privately
                            operated station. The <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>, therefore, is
                            of the opinion that a statement by the President along the lines of the
                            enclosed would help to clarify the matter. It is recognized that it may
                            be necessary to plant the question with one of the correspondents, but

                            <p>Question: It has been alleged that the Hungarian rebellion was caused
                                by Western radio broadcasts, particularly those of <gloss
                                    target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>. It is claimed the radio incited
                                the people to revolt and prolonged the fighting by promising outside
                                military assistance. Some comment in the Western press here and
                                abroad has expressed the fear that there may be some truth in those
                                charges. Would you care to comment?</p>
                            <p>Answer: The Hungarian revolution began, as I understand it, with a
                                peaceful demonstration in Budapest Square. It was turned into an
                                armed rebellion by the firing of the secret police on the students
                                and workers. There has been no more courageous example of the
                                spontaneous uprising of an entire people against foreign oppression.
                                The Nagy Government of Hungary, before it was crushed by Soviet
                                tanks, flatly denied the Soviet accusation of foreign incitement,
                                and the Hungarian people by their continued resistance against
                                overwhelming odds have demonstrated that this revolution springs
                                from their own hearts and is sustained by their own unconquerable
                                belief in human freedom. It would do the Hungarian people an
                                injustice to suggest otherwise.</p>
                            <p>As for the role of <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>, I have seen
                                statements by responsible leaders of that organization, such as
                                Joseph Grew and othe rs, indicating that they have always guarded
                                against inciting to violence and against making promises that could
                                not be fulfilled. The free world certainly must not mislead these
                                people with false promises but equally we must not allow them to be
                                misled by the totalitarian suppression of all truth. The message
                                that freedom exists and what it means has been carried in broadcasts
                                from the free world to the captive peoples, who otherwise would hear
                                only what their police-state masters want them to hear. The very
                                fact that freedom exists anywhere will, of course, encourage those
                                who are deprived of it to strive for their own liberty and
                                independence.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Although the problems presented by <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> radio programs to Hungary are
                            complex, it would seem that a look at our past and present media policy
                            is now called for (1) because of the new situation in which Hungary
                            finds itself, and (2) because of some criticism that US media played an
                            inciting role in the revolution by excessively encouraging hope of
                            active Western aid.</p>
                        <p>The latter problem is of interest primarily in so far as its discussion
                            casts light on our future programming. First of all, it should be
                            pointed out that a thorough reading of <gloss target="#t_VOA1"
                                >VOA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> scripts over
                            the past year would probably produce few specific examples of seriously
                            ill-advised statements inciting to revolt or holding forth unwarranted
                            hope of Western aid. However, such a review would, by and large, prove
                            little. We are still faced with the fact that the Hungarians for the
                            most part did interpret our broadcasts in a manner probably never
                            intended or foreseen. The problem that arises is intellectually an
                            intriguing one and involves the whole question of how we as a nation
                            succeed or fail in communicating with other peoples of the world. In the
                            Hungarian case we failed apparently to communicate properly, not because
                            of any isolated statements or misstatements but because the broad
                            contours of our expression meant one thing to the speaker and another to
                            the listener. Obviously one facet of United States policy is the desire
                            to see East European states regain their freedom. But the media
                            represented this facet somewhat more clearly than it presented our other
                            facet of how to go about the problem; particularly, the media did not
                            and could not anticipate the events which arose and prepare the
                            population for the reaction of the West.</p>
                        <p>Our isolation from so many of the Hungarian people naturally contributed
                            heavily toward the failure of our intelligence to gauge correctly the
                            temper of the Hungarians. Logically, on the basis of our limited
                            knowledge, it seemed proper to follow a program policy of sustaining a
                            long-range resistance to Communist ideology. Our media apparently
                            imagined the need for such sustenance to be far greater than it in fact
                            was. Thus what seemed to us as a defense move of holding the line turned
                            out to imply something far more to a people <pb n="521" xml:id="pg_521"
                                facs="0551"/>whose collective intensity of hatred for the Communists
                            was not fully realized by the United States. Had our intelligence,
                            especially among the youth, been able to operate more effectively, we
                            would probably have been able to flash even more warning signals to the
                            media than we did.</p>
                        <p>The Legation does not have any strongly positive recommendations for
                            media policy at present. It would seem, however, that in the exigency of
                            the present Hungarian situation the media should of necessity be
                            cautious and wait for Western policy makers to find some way out of the
                            dilemma which Hungary’s single-handed fight against Communism presents
                            to the anti-Communist world. Such caution, however, should not go so far
                            as to impose a restraint on the media giving the Hungarian
                            revolutionaries all the moral support possible. Actually our actions
                            have now made it clear to the Hungarians that we do not intend to
                            intervene with any sort of armed aid. Thus there is now little chance of
                            misunderstanding on this score. On the basis of past experience our
                            caution should rather extend to restraint from giving the appearance
                            that we are inciting overt acts of resistance, which are in some degree
                            inevitable anyway.</p>
                        <p>Future developments in Hungary will of course be the important
                            determinant in the development of a new media policy, when the situation
                            here has become more stable. Actually, in the period preceding October
                            23, <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> was adjusting itself to a line
                            which probably would have saved it from any criticism of implying active
                            US aid to a satellite revolt. <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>,
                            however, continued to pursue a stronger line, and when Hungarians charge
                            us with not having come to their aid they in general refer to <gloss
                                target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> “promises.” These promises, the
                            Legation is sure, were never literally made. For the moment and until
                            some kind of settlement of the Hungarian situation is achieved, the
                            Legation doubts the wisdom of any drastic curtailment or alteration of
                                <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> programs. Such curtailment,
                            especially in number of broadcasting hours, would be widely interpreted
                            as withdrawal of US interest from this area at a time when we can ill
                            afford such an interpretation. But looking farther into the future, the
                            Legation finds it difficult to conceive of a US policy toward Hungary,
                            once the present crisis is passed, which would justify the continuation
                            of <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> exactly along its present
                            lines.</p>
                        <p>If our policy toward Hungary continues to be one of holding a line of
                            ideological defense, it is on the surface obvious that the long daily
                            hours of anti-Soviet broadcasts by <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>
                            to Hungary is a questionable expenditure of money and effort. The
                            Hungarians have proved beyond any doubt that they want no kind of
                            settlement with Communism, not even a compromise settlement that may
                            eventually be forced on them because the anti-Communist world at the
                            moment lacks the power to force a Soviet withdrawal farther eastward.
                            Thus, assuming our future policy toward Hungary is a negative one, the
                            Legation <pb n="522" xml:id="pg_522" facs="0552"/>would recommend a
                            drastic curtailment in <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>’s
                            broadcasting hours. If, on the other hand, we believe that the Hungarian
                            rebellion is a positive factor which may contribute toward affecting the
                            Communist system on a world-wide scale, but is not sufficiently positive
                            to bring us to risk in any degree a third world war, we might continue
                                <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> much along its present lines if
                            its broad contours of expression make it amply clear that we regard the
                            Hungarian situation as a small tessera in a vast mosaic and that we are
                            by no means inclined to give it exaggerated importance in our world
                            policies.</p>
                        <p>In the period before the Hungarian revolution (as at present) the
                            Legation monitored <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> broadcasts only
                            casually and occasionally. The Legation thus cannot evaluate <gloss
                                target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> on the basis of the broadcasts
                            themselves. The Legation bases its attitudes toward the <gloss
                                target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> problem largely on Hungarian reactions
                            to and interpretations of these broadcasts, as learned from
                            conversations in the nearly two months since the revolution began. These
                            conversations with Hungarians, incidentally, have been wider than at any
                            time in the pre-revolutionary period, and although Hungarian criticisms
                            of <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> may be emotional, they should be
                            given the most careful consideration and accepted at face value if they
                            are not contravened by some overriding dictation of our own self
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>As for the current situation, below are listed a number of concrete
                            suggestions as to how the Legation believes it might be handled by the
                            media. These suggestions are presented in individually written memoranda
                            as appendices, which to some extent overlap but in general appear to
                            supplement each other.</p>

                            <p>Budapest is a city of mourning, with black flags and armbands much in
                                evidence. If restaurants are open, music is considered in bad taste.
                                Five main theaters were ordered to open again December 15. But the
                                workers refused to comply, donated the theaters’ supply of heating
                                coal to hospitals instead.</p>
                            <p>At the moment there is more unity among city worker, peasant,
                                intelligentsia and bureaucrat than ever in recent history. The
                                populace is Hungarian first, then social democrat, communist,
                                socialist, small holder adherent only second.</p>
                            <p>The Legation has found very little resentment against Americans. But
                                there is disappointment that the United States and the West did not
                                come actively to Hungary’s aid.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Specific Suggestions.</hi></p>
                            <p>During recent weeks, particularly during the general strike period,
                                more people have had more time to listen to Western broadcasts, for
                                news, than ever before. Straight news coverage should continue to
                                receive highest priority. Editorial roundups of free world reaction
                                to Hungary’s plight highly interesting to Hungarians.</p>
                            <p>All steps taken by free world to implement their anger at Soviets,
                                their steps to help Hungary, high priority. Particularly important
                                is the attitude of the so-called neutral nations and leaders of
                                India, Burma, Indonesia, which Hungarians feel carry greatest weight
                                with Soviets.</p>
                            <pb n="525" xml:id="pg_525" facs="0555"/>
                            <p>ICFTU effort to boycott delivery of goods to the Soviet Union has
                                been acclaimed as the most significant news here. This constituted
                                real and tangible immediate support, by worker for worker.</p>
                            <p>Internal Hungarian news is important, since communication within the
                                country is bad. Only the Hungarian radio covers the country as an
                                internal medium. Needless to say its reports are biased and
                                incomplete. The Legation feels that media should take no open stand
                                for, or against, the general strike, or the fleeing of Hungarians to
                                the West. With about 1 percent of the total Hungarian population in
                                Austria since the last few weeks, the Legation does not feel U.S.
                                interests here best served by either encouraging or discouraging
                                exodus. In this respect any large volume of taped interviews with
                                refugees might tend, through emphasis, to be interpreted as sign of
                                U.S. blessing. Accent should be on “Care I received from Aid to
                                Refugee Centers,” and not on “How I Escaped from Russian
                                Atrocities.”</p>
                            <p>Media, in Legation’s opinion, should be particularly wary of <hi
                                    rend="italic">all</hi> exile politician statements. Extremely
                                few were on the scene during the revolution.</p>
                            <p>Cross-reporting of events in other satellites to Hungary continues to
                                be useful.</p>
                            <p>Aid to Hungary by U.S. through Red Cross etc. should be stressed, but
                                not overemphasized.</p>
                            <p>A theme well worth continued exploitation is that it was the workers,
                                the workers’ districts that bore the brunt of the fighting. Soviet
                                claims of Hungary being a “workers’ paradise” are untenable even to
                                the Soviets. Soviet guided tour for Gheorgiu Dej, <persName

                                through rubble-strewn workers’ districts must have caused serious
                                doubts in their minds too.</p>

                            policy be modified to allow dollar sales of surplus agricultural
                            commodities on a selective basis to Eastern European bloc countries at
                            world market prices.<note n="4" xml:id="d215fn4">The <gloss

                            State’s proposal. The Department of State believes it would be desirable
                            for this changed policy to be discussed with Congressional leaders
                            before it is placed in operation; this consultation, however, need not
                            result in delay in meeting with a Polish delegation.</p>

                            concur in a decision to purchase Polish gold.<note n="5"

                                State would concur in the decision of the Department of the Treasury

                        <p>Except perhaps for triangular sales transactions, the Battle Act
                            prohibits the use of Mutual Security Program funds other than under the
                            authority of Section 401(a), and that section limits the use of such
                            funds to a maximum of $30,000,000 in any one country.</p>
                        <p>State has established that some funds are not yet committed under Section
                            401(b) of the Mutual Security Act. The amount of such uncommitted
                            authority and funds is limited. The use of these funds of course would
                            be at the expense of other actual or potential requirements. It would be
                            desirable to draw on them only for the most <pb n="527" xml:id="pg_527"
                                facs="0557"/>compelling needs and in the absence of other readily
                            available sources of funds. Any resort to Section 401 funds should be
                            confidential as public knowledge might be embarrassing to Poland to an
                            extent which could preclude an arrangement.</p>
                        <p>The Battle Act also precludes an extension of credit by the Export-Import
                            Bank or the Commodity Credit Corporation. The restrictions imposed by
                            the Battle Act on these available sources of loan financing are
                            significant, since Poland has expressed an interest in short-term
                            credits for the purchase of such products as cotton, grain, fats and
                            oils, fertilizer, and various types of machinery. Polish officials have
                            made clear that they do not desire emergency types of relief or gift
                            transactions in agricultural products. Poland is not prepared at this
                            time to enter into any arrangement which has the appearance of involving
                            political interference. Consideration is being given to a reexamination
                            of the statutes and determinations under which short-term credit
                            extended by United States Government lending institutions has been
                            deemed to constitute foreign aid within the meaning of the Battle Act.
                            Preliminary indications are that difficulties will be encountered in
                            modifying existing policy on this subject.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State has determined, and will explain to Congressional
                            leaders that Poland is a “friendly nation” under the definition of
                            Section 107 of Public Law 480, that is, that Poland is not now
                            “dominated or controlled by” the U.S.S.R. This finding opens the way for
                            the sale of surplus agricultural products for Polish currency or for
                            barter transactions. Two important limiting factors, however, continue
                            to apply to the use of Title I of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480
                            to meet the Polish situation. Authorizations under Title I of Public Law
                            480 are approaching exhaustion and steps are being taken to establish
                            priorities on progress already submitted by other governments.
                            Additional Title I authorization will be sought from Congress early in
                            the legislative year. The provisions of the Battle Act would presently
                            prevent any loan to Poland of foreign currency accruing through sales
                            under Title I of <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480; but this
                            currency might be held by the United States for U.S. uses including
                            procurement of items in Poland needed for U.S. purposes elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>The Section 107 determination regarding Poland also furnishes a basis for
                            later consideration of making a similar determination under the Trade
                            Agreements Act,<note n="6" xml:id="d215fn6"><gloss target="#t_PL1"
                                    >P.L.</gloss> 86, enacted June 21, 1955; 69 Stat. 162.</note>
                            with a consequent reduction in the rates of import duty applicable to
                            Polish products.</p>
                        <p>The position of the Department of State is that the necessary
                            preparations under existing legislation and policies are rapidly
                            approaching completion and that in accordance with paragraph 11(a) of
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5616/2 the Polish delegation
                            could be received at an early date. <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528"
                                facs="0558"/>The United States might be in a position at that time
                            to negotiate concerning a significant number of the products having
                            special interest for Poland, even if these were chiefly agricultural
                            products and relatively limited selected types of machinery and other
                            products which Poland has mentioned. Without new legislation, however,
                            the ability of the United States to extend credit on machinery and other
                            products would be very limited. Some changes in export licensing policy
                            would also be required, depending upon the types of machinery
                            involved.</p>
                        <p>As regards paragraph 11(b) of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5616/2,
                            the Department of State has taken appropriate steps to encourage the
                            reorientation of Polish trade toward the West, especially West Germany,
                            France and the United Kingdom. France, according to reports, has
                            concluded a trade agreement with Poland involving the supply of two
                            large electric generators to Poland. State has indicated to the French
                            its support of an exception being made to the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                                >COCOM</gloss> restrictions on the export of such equipment to the
                            bloc countries. West Germany recently concluded a $70 million trade
                            agreement with Poland. Economic difficulties have thus far hampered, and
                            may prevent, the U.K. in extending credits to Poland.</p>
                        <p>State has also had preliminary discussions with a German group which
                            might be able to participate in a triangular form of arrangement which
                            could involve Export Import Bank loans to West Germany for U.S.
                            commodities. These would be re-exported to Poland under West German
                            credits. The legality and feasibility of this arrangement is in doubt
                            and is being explored. The Department of State also believes it
                            advisable for all possibilities of direct bilateral arrangements to be
                            explored before turning to such indirect arrangements involving a third
                            country.</p>
                        <p>The overcoming of the remaining obstacles in achieving closer economic
                            relations with Poland would leave a need for new legislation if
                            operations of any considerable size prove to be desirable in the
                            furnishing of non-agricultural products on a credit basis. It may become
                            necessary, for example, to meet the objectives of paragraph 11(c) of
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5616/2, to recommend more
                            flexible statutory authority, such as a larger fund similar to the
                            present Section 401 of the Mutual Security Act. It may also be
                            appropriate to examine the existing legislation and particularly the
                            regulations under the Battle Act with a view to putting the Executive
                            Branch in a position to exploit promptly and effectively opportunities
                            to advance United States interests.</p>
                        <p>In view of the urgency of the matter, the present plan is to seek a
                            sufficient basis within the possibilities and limits of existing
                            legislation for initial detailed discussions with Poland. State has in
                            mind that these discussions could proceed bit by bit, with opportunities
                            to review <pb n="529" xml:id="pg_529" facs="0559"/>at each stage the

                                regarded as “friendly” and not under control or domination of the

                                conspiracy. The Department had started consulting leading members of

                                “friendliness” was subject to review.<note n="3" xml:id="d216fn3"

                                not altogether happy about this decision but thought on balance that

                                    >Campbell</persName> inquired whether the reversal of <gloss

                                which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> answered that
                                it applied to the Iron Curtain countries except the Soviet Union on
                                a selective basis, but that Poland was the only one of these
                                countries to which it was applicable at present. He said that next
                                week we might have something to tell the Poles on economic aid and
                                that there was much pressure in the <gloss target="#t_OCB1"
                                    >OCB</gloss> to move ahead in the matter. Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BPH1">Burris</persName> inquired whether
                                arrangements had been considered under which other European
                                countries might help Poland by means of triangular trade
                                arrangements. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> said
                                that we were not much in favor of that now. Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BPH1">Burris</persName> said that such arrangements
                                might save the Poles from endangering their relations with the USSR
                                by seeming to get too close to the United States. Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> said that there was little
                                danger of this since the Poles were getting comparatively slim
                                pickings from us. On the other hand, we did not want to discourage
                                other Western Countries from trading with Poland; the French and
                                Germans had something along these lines in mind although the British
                                had decided that they could not afford it.</item>

                                        >Beam</persName> reported that <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                        >UN</gloss> action on Hungary had slowed down. The Secretary
                                    General was not eager to send observers to Austria or other
                                    European countries if they could not go to Hungary and the
                                    observers themselves were not eager to go. A suggestion had been
                                    made that the Secretary General’s role on Hungary be turned over
                                    to a watchdog committee to be chosen by the General Assembly. We
                                    were considering this idea, which had some advantages in that it
                                    would help to preserve the Secretary General’s neutral status in
                                    the Near Eastern problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL1"

                                    emphasis on the fact that the Hungarian revolt had been one of
                                    workers and intellectuals against communism, and he suggested
                                    that our propaganda might make use of the article.</p>
                                <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CL1">Campbell</persName> said that a
                                    publication was being prepared making a comparison between
                                    photographs of demonstrating crowds in the October 1917 Russian
                                    revolution and in the Hungarian revolt; there was a remarkable
                                    similarity in some of the scenes. Mr. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_REL1">Revey</persName> said he had some
                                    reservations about this; first, it prejudged the Czarist regime
                                    (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> commented that
                                    the Czarist regime had long since been well judged) and, second,
                                    Eastern Europeans might not like it, since they might consider
                                    their own revolutions different from the Russian one. Mr.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_CL1">Campbell</persName> said that the

                                    had been impressed by the book <hi rend="italic">Ten Days That

                                    German Social Democrats. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPH1"
                                        >Burris</persName> said that Mr. Lightner was impressed by
                                    the idea and hoped that <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>
                                    was using it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CL1">Campbell</persName>
                                    said that this was a long-range project especially suitable for
                                    use during the 40th anniversary of the 1917 revolution. Mr.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> said he did not
                                    see how we could lose on this project and Colonel Hansen also
                                    supported the idea. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FEL1"
                                        >Freers</persName> said that it would be a good idea to
                                    contrast the present policy of countries which had been colonial
                                    empires in the 19th century with the colonialism characteristic
                                    of the Soviet Union today.</p>

                                        of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, January 7, 1957,
                                        pp. 3–4.</note> seemed to fix our policy toward the
                                    satellites in favor of an evolutionary process, and that the
                                    question then arose what we would do in case of another Hungary.
                                    If a real revolt arose in Poland or East Germany Europe could
                                    hardly stand another attack such as had occurred against
                                    Hungary. Mr. Ernst said that the Department of Defense was also
                                    puzzling over that problem. Defense assumed that our ability to
                                    control or influence events was limited and that the question
                                    therefore was what we did if such a revolt actually happened. It
                                    was inclined to think that the best course would be prompt
                                        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> intercession or
                                    intervention. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Revey</persName>
                                    said <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> planned not to give
                                    too much play to the Secretary’s statement except as immediate
                                    reassurance against any American desire to incite revolt.</p>
                                <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Revey</persName> asked for
                                    comments on the Polish-Soviet agreement on the stationing of
                                    Soviet troops in Poland. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJD1"
                                        >Beam</persName> answered that the Department was analyzing
                                    it and comparing it with our own status of forces agreement, and
                                    that guidance would be forthcoming.<note n="9" xml:id="d216fn9"

                                <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> asked Mr. Boerner
                                    how he interpreted the Secretary’s statement. Mr. Boerner said
                                    that the <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> was not going to
                                    try to knock over any apple carts but it was sometimes a problem
                                    how to avoid that in a particular situation. Speculation whether
                                    we were going to negotiate with the Soviets was appearing in the
                                    press and real policy guidance rather than improvisation was
                                    needed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> said
                                    that Chalmers Roberts had recently expressed a correct opinion
                                    when he wrote that the thing to do now was to take matters
                                    easily and do nothing to help the Russians out of the dilemma
                                    they were in in Eastern Europe. Negotiations now would be
                                    unrealistic.</p>
                                <p>Colonel Hansen inquired whether the <gloss target="#t_BBC1"
                                        >BBC</gloss> was coordinating with us on output to Eastern
                                    Europe to which Mr. Boerner replied that they were also taking a
                                    cautious line.</p></item>

                                about the inflammatory nature of American broadcasts to Hungary. He
                                read portions of a letter the <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>

                                the Senator asked for texts of sample <gloss target="#t_VOA1"
                                    >VOA</gloss> broadcasts to Hungary, including one of the Voice’s
                                “most inflammatory” broadcasts, one of its “least inflammatory” and
                                one of an “average” broadcast. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FEL1"
                                    >Freers</persName> said he thought the thing to say was that we
                                meant the same as the Secretary had meant in his recent statement.
                                Mr. Boerner expressed doubts whether the agency would get off so
                                easily. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> commented
                                that realization of our impotence to act in Hungary had had a
                                sobering effect on public opinion about Eastern Europe. Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MKRM1">McKisson</persName> pointed out
                                that the Soviets also had a tough problem in Eastern Europe and that
                                we need not strain ourselves to do anything about it. Mr. Boerner
                                commented that it was hard to stick by some of the Government’s
                                decisions on the Hungarian problem; for example, the original idea
                                had been that as many nations as possible should receive Hungarian
                                refugees but that the refugee matter was more and more becoming an
                                American operation as a result of public criticism that too little
                                was being done for the refugees.</item>

                                suggested various ways of dramatizing the mission including having

                                later stated, however, that he did not wish to go if it appeared
                                like a “grandstand play.” (Memorandum of telephone conversation by

                                announcement of the Vice President’s trip to Austria as the
                                President’s personal representative was made on December 12. He
                                departed on December 18 and returned on December 24. Subsequently,
                                on December 27, he visited the refugee facility at Camp Kilmer. For

                                January 21, 1957, pp. 94–99.</note> On that trip he was accompanied
                            by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> and Mr.
                            Rogers.</p>
                        <p>His first point was that the U.S. should not continue to speak of the <hi
                                rend="italic">numbers</hi> of refugees it is admitting. The British
                            and French take credit for an unlimited number, though actually they do
                            have limitation. He came back to this point a number of times.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President is going to prepare a brief summary report for the
                            leaders’ meetings next Monday and Tuesday.<note n="4" xml:id="d218fn4"

                                his meeting with Congressional leaders on January 1, the President
                                announced that, pending Congressional action, the Attorney General
                                would continue to parole Hungarian refugees into the United States.

                        <p>Under his general comments, the Vice President first stressed that
                            despite the confusion, generally speaking a very good job is being done
                            for the refugees. There are some big camps, some smaller ones, some
                            people housed in schoolhouses and barracks, and Salzburg and Munich and
                            other places have taken some. The Salzburg camp is probably the best
                            one.</p>
                        <p>He praised particularly the work Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1"
                                >Thompson</persName>, in Austria, of the Immigration people, and
                            talked at some length about the voluntary efforts of service people at
                            various spots along the way to provide packages and extraordinarily
                            thoughtful things for the Hungarians. The President asked <persName
                                corresp="#p_GCAJ1">Colonel Goodpaster</persName> to prepare for him
                            a letter to General Max Taylor commending the service people and wives.
                            He also said parenthetically that the situation at Camp Kilmer had
                            greatly improved from the early first days. The President also suggested
                            that if the Vice President spoke again on television, he should put in a
                            word about the service people.</p>
                        <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536" facs="0566"/>
                        <p>The Vice President’s next general comment was about the high calibre of
                            the refugees. They are young, in most cases the people “had” to leave
                            the country—i.e. the leadership type—to avoid deportation. The President
                            recalled that <persName corresp="#p_ZMGK1">Marshal Zhukov</persName> had
                            once said if you got rid of the leaders of a country, you could do
                            anything you wanted to.</p>
                        <p>About the security problem, the Vice President minimised the danger,
                            particularly because there are so many people coming out that everyone
                            is known to a lot of the others and it is hard in that way to slip into
                            them a person who might be planted for spying purposes. However, some of
                            the Congressional leaders are worrying about that. The President thinks
                            such danger is almost zero—and said the Communists did not have to go to
                            such elaborate means as would be necessary in this case, in order to get
                            “spies” into our country.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said the other countries regard these particular
                            refugees as tremendous assets, rather than liabilities—pointed out that
                            Holland, overcrowded as it is, had taken 300 and wanted more. Germany is
                            taking 10% of all that come over—they are experts in handling refugees.
                            The Hungarians are productive people—later in the discussion the
                            President pointed out what a tremendous thing it would be for the Mid
                            East people to take in some of these industrious people.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President next went to the size of the problem, though there are
                            so many imponderables it is difficult to be accurate. Approximately
                            151,000 have come out to date, of these 70,000 are still in
                            Austria—80,000 having moved on into other countries. We have taken about
                            14,000—and have processed remaining 7,000 that at present we may take.
                            The transportation of these 7,000 will require until January 10th. They
                            are still coming out at rate of 800 a day, and no one can say for how
                            long that will go on. There is feeling that the Russians are soon going
                            to have a major decision to make—one that might start the tide going
                            back (if any change in government in Hungary)—or the Russians may clamp
                            down on exodus.</p>
                        <p>The President had been advised that it would be cheaper to keep these
                            people in Austria, the U.S. paying the costs, but the Vice President
                            emphatically disagreed.</p>
                        <p>Back to the figures, there are about 63,000 in Austria as yet unplaced,
                            of which 10,000 will be taken by other countries. Austria has said that
                            they can absorb 30,000 (but there is a joker in that, since they put as
                            a condition the money to build housing facilities—and, it was later
                            said, any houses that might be built would undoubtedly go to the local
                            politicos rather than the refugees). At any rate that would leave about
                            20,000 odd thousand for whom places must be found, plus the 800 a day
                            coming in.</p>
                        <pb n="537" xml:id="pg_537" facs="0567"/>
                        <p>The Vice President pointed out the danger in leaving people too long in
                            refugee camps because of morale problem. The President said that the
                            danger was really based on the nature of the people, that the Latvians
                            and Estonians, etc., had, during the war, conducted model camps—because
                            of their very nature. But the Hungarians are volatile and impulsive—and
                            the camps would be breeding grounds for Communist propaganda.</p>
                        <p>An additional problem is that a number of the refugees have gone to other
                            countries, with the promise that they will be brought to America as soon
                            as possible (however, the other countries will take replacements). The
                            President said Britain should work out an arrangement with the
                            Commonwealth—Australia, however, is taking 4,000. The President said he
                            had asked Nehru to take a certain token number, despite India’s
                            overcrowded condition.<note n="5" xml:id="d218fn5">Nehru visited the
                                United States between December 16 and 20, 1956.</note> The ones in
                            Italy must be taken out as soon as possible. The President suggested to
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HLW1">Henderson</persName> that the State
                            Department should work with the Latin American nations to try to get
                            them to take a certain number each—they are in general underpopulated
                            and can use the skills the Hungarians have.</p>
                        <p>The question is where do we go from there? The President suggested that,
                            pending action on the part of Congress, processing be continued on a
                            temporary basis—and at the same time the refugees be processed by other
                            countries, with the explanation given to them that the United States
                            cannot at the moment definitely guarantee them entry. Bill Rogers said
                            that the Attorney General was not willing to guarantee more “parolees”
                            without at least an understanding with the Congressional leaders that
                            such action would be approved by Congress. The President pointed out
                            that he did not want to stop processing, particularly since if we do,
                            the pick of the refugees will go to other countries.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that the matter should be presented to the bipartisan
                            meeting of Congress, rather than to the Republicans alone.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rogers suggested that something on the order of “suspension
                            deportation” arrangements can be worked out.</p>
                        <p>The President brought up what he had heard was lack of response to the
                            Red Cross appeal. The Vice President said appeal had picked up, and it
                            was agreed that the money would probably come in in the quantity
                            necessary. The President hopes it does, because that would indicate the
                            people of the country are behind the movement—and if so, Congress will
                            go along. The Vice President emphasized that it is important that the
                            United States not drag its feet—that it stay in the forefront of the
                            moment, that we continue to take applications at current rate. The
                            President said we could take the applications—could say that we will
                            take our “full share” or “decent share” of refugees. He <pb n="538"
                                xml:id="pg_538" facs="0568"/>pointed out that what we were talking
                            about was really a small number of those that might come in, if, for
                            instance, Poland and Czechoslovakia should have upheavals similar to the
                            Hungarian one. He also said we have got to have every country in the
                            world feel some responsibility. The United Nations ought to pass a
                            Resolution commending each nation for its readiness to open its
                            doors.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President suggested that <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Cabot
                                Lodge</persName> might make as a primary order of business the
                            urging of the Ambassadors to the United Nations that their countries
                            accept this responsibility.</p>
                        <p>There was some question as to how quickly Congress would act (in matter
                            of increasing number of people the US could take)—the Vice President
                            said two months; it was hoped not that long. The President said,
                            incidentally, that he was willing to see Congressman Walter<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d218fn6">Democratic Congressman Francis E. Walter of
                                Pennsylvania was a member of the Joint Committee on Immigration and
                                Nationality Policy.</note> if that would be helpful in enlisting his
                            energetic cooperation.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President urged that here was an opportunity to get needed
                            flexibility into our Immigration laws. He pointed out also the seeming
                            injustice to the 10,000 Eastern European refugees who are anxious to
                            come to this country—who crawled under barbed wire to come out—and who
                            have been long in camps, mainly in Germany. The Justice Department is
                            going to recommend such flexibility.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the economic side—there was discussion of the amounts needed
                            (which of course depends on the number that will continue to come out)
                            and whether Congress should be asked for a special appropriation.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> spoke about the
                            magnitude of the problem and said, with money available in <gloss
                                target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>, he could absorb some $60-65 million of
                            the cost, assuming that Mid East projects for which money was
                            appropriated did not materialize. However, the President said that he
                            hoped that at least part of that money would be used for the Mid East.
                            It was agreed that the U.S. was going to have to shoulder the burden of
                            the major part of the financing. A payment of some $5 million has been
                            made to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, but it was questioned
                            whether other members of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had put
                            in their share.<note n="7" xml:id="d218fn7">On December 15, in response
                                to General Assembly Resolution 1007 (ES–II), the President declared

                                Nations to assist Hungarian refugees. This was in addition to the

                                <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> pointed out there
                            were three distinct projects: general refugee problem; refugees coming
                            to this country; and the situation in Hungary itself. There are the
                            private agencies; there is the International Red Cross; and there are
                            the other red cross teams operating in Austria. He recommended a
                            “dictator” under Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1"
                                >Thompson</persName> to handle the details of payments, etc.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> hopes to make as
                            many payments as possible in <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0569"
                            />commodities and in a deal that will utilize some shillings he has in
                            reserve. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> told the
                            President of the “bill” the Austrian government presented them, for
                            expenses for people already there, for anticipated people, and, again,
                            for the housing they hope to build with American funds. The Vice
                            President thought it would be well to ask the Congress for $30-40
                            million for the purpose—he is inclined to think it would be a good idea
                            to let the Congress see this refugee problem in its entirety—as a single
                            package. The President may want to discuss this with Congressional
                            leaders.</p>
                        <p>Tracy Voorhees presented two or three points. To prevent piling up of
                            refugees at Camp Kilmer, it may be necessary for the government to
                            provide transportation and other assistance to some of the private
                            charities, specifically Catholic Charities. Secondly, he has contracted
                            with a public relations firm, to be paid for independently, a program
                            for creating a “suction effort” throught the country. So far it has been
                            a “retail” job. He hopes this suction effort will prevent later
                            repercussions about placement of refugees. There is needed also some way
                            of “dividing” up the refugees among the voluntary agencies. We ought to
                            have something to say about which agencies will be the sponsoring
                            agencies.</p>
                        <p>About the transportation from abroad, he said the Pentagon wanted it all
                            contracted for. The President has little patience with the grumblings of
                            the services.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion Mr. Voorhees told the President of the reception his
                            letter to the refugees had had at Camp Kilmer.<note n="8"
                                xml:id="d218fn8">In his letter, which was undated, the President
                                welcomed the Hungarians to American soil and concluded: “We realize
                                that you ardently hope for a time when all Hungarians can enjoy the
                                blessings of individual freedom in their Hungarian mother-country.
                                We join in that hope. And we give you this present assurance—if,
                                when that day dawns once more, you should choose to go back to your

                        <p>Kuznetsov is certainly one of most agreeable and quiet spoken Sov
                            officials, but he is likewise staunch Bolshevik and his “unofficial”
                            approach is of course highly official but with added advantage that he
                            does not have any decisive voice in Sov policy determination.</p>
                        <p>I do not see from our point of view any solution on Hungary alone and
                            only possibility, which in itself is extremely remote, would be as part

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Ezra</hi>: The President on November 19, 1956
                            approved a statement of policy recommended by the National Security
                            Council in <pb n="542" xml:id="pg_542" facs="0572"/>regard to
                                Poland.<note n="2" xml:id="d220fn2"><gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                    >NSC</gloss> 5616/2, <ref target="#d196">Document
                                196</ref>.</note> That statement of policy set forth certain courses
                            of action to be undertaken by the United States. One course of action
                            called on the Executive Branch to be prepared to make available at
                            Polish request economic and technical assistance in moderate amounts
                            sufficient to give the Poles an alternative to complete dependence on
                            Moscow. The premise to this course of action is that the current
                            situation with respect to Poland is not fundamentally altered.</p>
                        <p>Pursuant to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> statement of policy
                            in regard to Poland as approved by the President and in accordance with
                            the provisions of Section 107 of Public Law 480, I have determined that
                            Poland is not now dominated or controlled by the USSR or by a foreign
                            organization controlling the world Communist movement and hence Poland
                            is eligible for Title I and Title III Public Law 480 transactions. The
                            Department is informing the Chairmen of the interested Congressional
                            committees of this determination<note n="3" xml:id="d220fn3">See
                                footnote 9, <ref target="#d215">Document 215</ref>.</note> as well
                            as the recent action taken by the Council on Foreign Economic Policy to
                            modify United States policy so as to allow surplus agricultural
                            commodities to be exported for dollars at world market prices to Eastern
                            European countries (except the Soviet Union) on a selective basis in the
                            national interest.<note n="4" xml:id="d220fn4">See <ref
                                    target="#d215fn4">footnote 4, <hi rend="italic"

                        <p>In making this determination, I found that the factors for and against
                            such a decision were closely matched and that the decision itself was an
                            extremely close one. My decision on this matter was significantly
                            influenced by the requirements of one of the major United States policy
                            objectives in regard to Poland, namely to provide sufficient positive
                            incentives to induce Poland to continue to resist domination by the
                            USSR. A reorientation and strengthening of Polish relations with the
                            West will assist in the achievement of that objective.</p>
                        <p>It will of course be necessary for us to proceed carefully in our
                            negotiations with the Polish Government, and to review and evaluate each
                            specific action taken by us to assist that government in resisting
                            domination by the USSR, before proceeding to further actions. This
                            finding is subject to reappraisal and also we will have to keep in mind
                            that the situation could readily change so I would feel required to
                            alter the determination I am now making. I am confident that the staffs
                            of our two agencies will take full account of these policy
                            considerations as specific Public Law 480 transactions with Poland are
                            considered.</p>

                                        the impact on Hungarian morale, it was not worth the

                                        >Beam</persName> said that it was to follow events and
                                    invite governments to provide information on Hungary. He read
                                    from the committee’s proposed terms of reference. Mr. Cox
                                    inquired what group would hear Anna Kethly and other prominent

                                    said that there was some thought this new committee might hear
                                    such refugees. Another idea was for one of the regular
                                    committees or sub-committees to do so. The Scandinavian
                                    countries supported the move to have Kethly heard but would take

                                    that we did not want to seem to bear out the Soviet allegations

                                <p>Mr. Boerner asked what our reactions were to the Secretary

                                        >Beam</persName> said that the Department had not formulated
                                    its position yet but there was not much in the report and,
                                    moreover, it was somewhat contradictory in that it said that the
                                    observers’ group could not function but nevertheless proposed
                                    the formation of another group to perform almost the same
                                    functions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MKRM1">McKisson</persName>
                                    commented that some of the British proposals would be useful

                                there were any new thoughts on the subject of aid to Hungary. In

                                reports had been received on Hungary’s long-term relief needs, and
                                the question had arisen whether relief on a large scale might
                                develop into economic aid. A paper was being drawn up on this
                                problem. It was desired to keep aid on a relief basis, going
                                directly to the people through the Red Cross. Mr. <persName

                                contributions from member governments for Hungarian relief<note

                                had preferred to make their contributions to the Red Cross. The
                                Secretary General accordingly wanted us to contribute funds and
                                supplies to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> which would pass

                                    corresp="#p_MKRM1">McKisson</persName> said that Mr. <persName

                                were dubious about this. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CL1"
                                    >Campbell</persName> suggested that we might do this even apart

                                    corresp="#p_BRO1">Blake</persName> mentioned that the Soviet

                                which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> replied that
                                the political committee would adjourn after the third week in

                                had heard there was a possibility the committee might never get to
                                this agenda item. Mr. Boerner mentioned a disagreement whether we
                                should adopt tactics of brushing aside the Soviet accusation or take
                                it seriously. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPH1">Burris</persName> said
                                that this question was being considered. Mr. <persName

                            personalities all of which have been nominated by “national front”

                            or approval of the Polish-Soviet economic or military agreements;
                            economic or labor policies, agricultural or tax measures, western aid,
                            relations with Hungary, have not yet been presented to the

                        <p>Election questions about which western observers here most interested at
                            present are (a) extent to which voters may approve Communist and
                            pro-Communist unknowns over “big-name” Communists and (b) extent to
                            which voters will be permitted to scratch ticket, abstain from voting,
                            or be forced to vote. Either (a) and (b) may result in protest against
                            regime. Evidently regime hopes its concessions particularly on
                            collectivization and to the church, together with its show of resistance
                            to Soviet dictation, will enable it to coax reasonably satisfactory
                            performance out of voters.</p>

                        <p>Regime cannot effectively deny population right privately to cherish
                            anti-Communist or anti-Socialist views but continues to deny right to
                            express them or to translate them into action. Openly stating that it
                            does not believe in freedom for such views, regime reinforces its
                            restrictions by implying that debate on such questions as desirability
                            Soviet garrisons in Poland or events in Hungary invites Soviet armed
                            intervention as in Hungary. Having cut away this much freedom, regime
                            willing permit limited freedom in other respects. For example, recent
                            trends indicate regime becoming much less restrictive in passport
                            policy. Immigration policies other countries and foreign exchange
                            problems now compete with regime passport policy for blame in hindering
                            free travel Polish citizens.</p>
                        <p>Although press remains under regime control, slanting and suppression
                            appear diminished from year ago. Western broadcasts heard with
                            negligible interference. Whether existing interference Soviet, Czech or
                            Polish origin not fully established. Entertainment and human interest
                            given more space in press, radio and theater. Regime sensitivity to
                            press criticism especially with police state connotations, illustrated
                            by refusal grant visas to certain US correspondents.</p>
                        <p>Future developments in regime internal policy promise to reflect not only
                            relative influence supporters conservative “nationalist” policies and
                            exponents “progressive” policies of bolder measure liberalization, but
                            will also reflect developments within Soviet leadership, and in
                            relations between Soviets and Yugoslavs, Chinese, Hungarians, and other
                            orbit countries. Similarly, Polish external relations will be affected
                            by important considerations outside Poland and beyond scope this
                            assessment. In present international climate Polish regime may be

                            made in October. In past year regime drew increasingly close to
                            Yugoslavia and optimistically professed to have found Chinese Communist
                            and Indian support. Present evidence suggests Chinese Communists more
                            anxious to promote solidarity between Chinese and Soviet parties than to
                            support Polish insubordination.</p>

                            9, it had before it a draft resolution sponsored by the United States
                            and 23 other nations (in final form A/3487/Rev.1). It bore a close
                            resemblance to the text suggested by the Department of State in <gloss

                            764.00/12–256) Over the course of four meetings on January 9 and 10, the
                            Assembly debated the proposal, which was opposed by the Soviet Union.
                            Resolution 1132(XI) was adopted at the 636th meeting by a vote of 59 to
                            8, with 10 abstentions. In the resolution, the General Assembly resolved
                            to establish a Special Committee, composed of representatives of
                            Australia, Ceylon, Denmark, Tunisia, and Uruguay, “to investigate, and
                            to establish and maintain direct observation in Hungary and elsewhere.”
                            The Committee’s findings would be reported to the General Assembly at
                            its 11th session. The Soviet Union and Hungary were also called upon to
                            cooperate with the Committee and to allow it to enter Hungarian
                            territory and travel freely within.</p>
                        <p>On January 11, the Permanent Mission of Hungary addressed a note verbale

                            statement of the Government of Hungary dated January 10. In very strong
                            terms, the <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kádár</persName> government
                            denounced Resolution 1132(XI) as “unprecedented gross interference” and
                            indicated that it considered “suchlike resolutions” inadmissible
                            violations of Hungarian sovereignty. The note continued: <quote

                        <p>In conclusion, it rejected the idea that a “committee of any kind has the

                            establish observation in Hungary in order to obtain information.” It
                            demanded that the “so-called Hungarian question” be deleted from the

                            <item>Polish Elections of January 20</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>It is clear that, although the Polish elections will provide voters with
                            some very slight choice, in contrast to none at all in the past, the
                            elections will certainly not be free. However, in view of Poland’s
                            present difficult international position, and <persName corresp="#p_GW1"
                                >Gomulka</persName>’s difficult position within Poland, the
                            Department does not wish to make an issue of this matter, at least this
                            time, or to attack the present Polish regime on these grounds.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances it is hoped that it will be possible to avoid
                            making any direct official comment on the elections whatsoever. However,
                            if pressed for specific comment on the subject, it is recommended that
                            official spokesmen simply reply along the lines that available
                            information indicates that, while Polish voters had somewhat more choice
                            than in the past, the elections were far from what is generally
                            considered in the United States to be free.</p>
                        <p>It is also recommended that <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>
                            broadcasts to Poland refrain from direct comment on the elections and
                            limit themselves to a small number of carefully chosen Free World press
                            reports indicating, among other things, that the elections were not
                            free. <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> broadcasts to other countries
                            might devote more time to the elections, including a description of the
                            organization and methods of the elections, but without attacking them as
                            controlled or praising them as an “improvement.”</p>
                        <p>It is quite possible that developments in Poland prior to, during, or
                            following the elections may be of such a serious and dramatic nature as
                            to require modification of the foregoing recommendations.<note n="2"

                        <p>Since Cardinal Mindszenty was granted refuge in the Legation in Budapest
                            our position, which has been repeatedly made known to him, has been that
                            he could not be allowed to use the Legation as a base of operations.
                            This attitude is based on the extreme delicacy of the situation arising
                            from the Cardinal’s presence in the Legation and our desire to do
                            nothing which might make his position more precarious or that of the
                            Legation more difficult.</p>
                        <p>Under an informal letter to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MKRM1"
                                >McKisson</persName> in <gloss target="#t_EE1">EE</gloss> Minister

                            Latin to the Pope and to the Vatican Secretary of State. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WET1">Wailes</persName> suggests that they be translated
                            and if found to be “innocuous” forwarded to the Vatican. “If the letters
                            contain matters of business, you may want to return them to me,” Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WET1">Wailes</persName> continues, “and direct
                            me to tell the Cardinal that we just can’t send them to Rome”. Mr.

                        <p>The Cardinal’s letters raise a number of serious questions:</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>If these six letters are transmitted they will probably be
                                followed by more and thus the Department’s pouch facilities would
                                tend to become a regular channel of covert communication between the
                                Vatican and the Cardinal. Written records of this nature if
                                inadvertently revealed or “leaked” to the press or to the church
                                hierarchy would cause us embarrassment and might compromise our
                                Legation and prejudice the Cardinal’s safety.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Whether the current letters or any which may follow constitute
                                “conduct of business” cannot be determined until they are translated
                                and read. If they are read, the Department is immediately placed in
                                the position of censoring the Cardinal’s correspondence on the basis
                                of criteria which will be difficult to define clearly and equally
                                difficult to justify to the Cardinal and the Vatican.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>It must also be anticipated that if letters from the Cardinal are
                                sent to the Pope, the Vatican will logically expect the privilege of
                                replying via the same channel. The Department might then be faced
                                with the necessity of scanning and possibly rejecting messages from
                                the Pope.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>While the proposed transmission of the Cardinal’s letters appears
                            inadvisable for the reasons set forth, it is not felt that the
                            Department should prevent all contact between the Cardinal and the Pope.
                            The <pb n="556" xml:id="pg_556" facs="0586"/>Vatican has an
                            understandable interest in Cardinal Mindszenty’s welfare and the
                            Cardinal is bound to grow increasingly restive and resentful if denied
                            all communication with the Vatican. A possible solution would be to
                            accept occasional oral messages of a brief and personal nature for
                            transmission. This would impose a natural and, in our opinion, desirable
                            restraint on the parties concerned. It would also make it quite clear
                            that the contents of all messages would be known to the Department but
                            would eliminate the unpleasant connotation of censorship. Finally, by
                            its very nature, this mode of transmission would result in fewer
                            communications.</p>

                        <p>On December 3, a German Foreign Office official informed Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJB1">Conant</persName> that <gloss
                                target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> had been too “energetic” in offering
                            practical advice to the Hungarians on how to behave in a revolt
                            situation. (Telegram 2127 from Bonn; Department of State, Central Files,
                            940.40/12–356) On December 20, telegram 2416 from Bonn indicated that
                            the Embassy had been informed that the German review of <gloss
                                target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> programs in the period from October 23
                            to November 10, 1956, had shown no broadcast stating that the West would
                            furnish concrete military help. However, criticism of some programs on
                            lesser grounds was expressed. The Embassy suggested an approach to the
                            German <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557" facs="0587"/>Government to the effect
                            that the airing of this subject prior to United Nations consideration of
                            the Soviet resolution alleging United States intervention and subversion
                            in Soviet and Satellite affairs would be playing into the hands of the
                            Communists. Telegram 1767 to Bonn, December 22, instructed the Embassy
                            to request the German Government to delay the report’s release. (<hi

                        <p>The Embassy contacted government officials as directed on December 28 to
                            forestall the release of the report at a time when it would redound to
                            the advantage of the Soviet Union in the United Nations. (Telegram 2489
                            from Bonn, December 28; <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., 940.40/12–2856) At
                            a subsequent meeting, the Embassy received assurances from the German
                            State Secretary for Foreign Affairs, <persName>Walter
                                Hallstein</persName>, that there was no plan in a “strict sense” to
                            issue a report. But if press or Bundestag pressure increased, then the
                            government, after consulting with the Embassy, wished to be able to
                            issue a statement “that objection was found to certain broadcasts, and
                            that this had been discussed with <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>
                            which had taken corrective measures.” The Embassy had already informed
                            the Foreign Office that <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> was 1)
                            instituting wider prebroadcast scrutiny of programs particularly in
                            sensitive situations; 2) curtailing the amount of programming; and 3)
                            replacing unsatisfactory personnel and adding staff to facilitate more
                            careful control. (Telegram 2568 from Bonn, January 5; <hi rend="italic"

                        <p>At the Federal Republic’s request, these points were incorporated in a
                            January 11 letter from Condon to Professor Wilhelm Grewe, Chief of the
                            Political Division of the Foreign Office. Condon maintained that the
                            results of the German investigation and of <gloss target="#t_RFE1"
                                >RFE</gloss>’s own internal probe showed that the “reproaches
                            against <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> that it had incited the
                            Hungarian people to revolt or had promised them military help from the
                            West are unfounded and cannot be supported.</p>
                        <p>“A few transmissions, to which you have directed our attention, were also
                            criticized by us in retrospect as having a tone which was understandable
                            in the situation but unnecessarily provocative. These transmissions,
                            however, represent only a fraction of the total number of programs which
                            were presented in the period in question. There is not the slightest
                            evidence that these few transmissions had any influence whatsoever on
                            the course of the historic events in Hungary. Moreover, it seems to us
                            that it would be disrespectful of the courage and sacrifice for the
                            cause of peace of the Hungarian people if one were to ascribe their
                            attitude, which continues unbroken even today, to a few emotional
                            transmissions of foreign radio stations. The tone of these transmissions
                            was rather a spontaneous tribute which was paid to the heroism of the
                            Hungarian patriots.” (Despatch 1204 from Bonn, January 21; <hi

                            broadcasts, he replied that “An examination has taken place; this
                            examination showed that the assertions which had been voiced in the
                            press, that the European radio station, or rather Radio Free Europe, had
                            promised the Hungarians military aid from the West, are not in
                            conformity with the facts. However, also some remarks were made which
                            might give rise to misinterpretations; on this, a discussion, an
                            exchange of ideas took place; changes in the staffing resulted from it,
                            and I believe that for the time being the matter may be regarded as
                            settled.” (Telegram 2849 from Bonn, January 25; <hi rend="italic"

                            negotiations could be conducted on Poland’s economic requirements from
                            the United States. More detailed and reliable information on Poland’s
                            economic situation and needs would be forthcoming in the course of our
                            talks with the Polish Government representatives. As of this time
                            therefore the resolution of the question of the amount and character of
                            funds available for negotiations with Poland requires essentially a
                            political judgment.</p>

                        <p>The staff members continue to believe that it would be helpful to have
                            available $25 million in funds and authority, composed of $15 million of
                            Title I, Public Law 480 authority (equivalent to about $10 or $11
                            million of purchasing power for surplus agricultural commodities at
                            world market prices), and $10 million of Section 401 funds which would
                            most likely be made available on a loan basis. The provisions of the
                            Battle Act would not permit the use of Polish currency generated by the
                            sale of surplus agricultural commodities for loans to Poland. Such
                            currency could be used for payment of United States obligations and for
                            other United States uses. A Public Law 480, Title I transaction would
                            not therefore involve a loan or grant of resources to Poland. The net
                            addition of resources to the Polish economy would come primarily by the
                            use of Section 401 funds. Moreover, the Poles have already indicated to
                            us that their priority requirements include several items, such as coal
                            mining equipment, which can only be procured under Section 401
                            authority. In view of the limitations imposed by the Battle Act on funds
                            and authority (except for Section 401 of the Mutual Security Act)
                            available for extending economic help to Poland, we believe that $10
                            million of funds from this section should tentatively be set aside at
                            this time for possible use by Poland.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName>’s memorandum of
                            January 16, 1957 also detailed a number of operating problems which
                            might arise in the implementing stage of economic assistance furnished
                            to Poland. Some of the listed problems would not arise if procurement is
                            limited to the United States and the Section 401 funds are furnished on
                            a loan basis, as we expect. Other possible problems can only be resolved
                            in context of our talks with the Polish representatives. We have been
                            discussing with the staffs of <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>,
                            Commerce and other interested government agencies various problems in

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: It is eight months since I
                            last wrote you of the situation in Rumania,<note n="2" xml:id="d230fn2"
                                >Not found in Department of State files.</note> and I have waited
                            until I believed it was possible to make a reasonable estimate of the
                            impact on this country of the dramatic events of the last few months
                            before sending you another brief summary of my personal views.</p>
                        <p>The events in Poland and Hungary of course deeply stirred the emotions of
                            the Rumanian people who reacted in various ways. The few remaining
                            members of the old regime were jubilant over what they termed the
                            beginning of the downfall of Communism, and were quoting the saying of
                            General Joffre, “La victoire est une pente roulante”. <pb n="562"
                                xml:id="pg_562" facs="0592"/>The population in general were
                            restless—there were incidents here and there amongst students and
                            workers—but there was no spontaneous movement of resistance, no general
                            will to do anything that might risk arrest—there was not a vestige of
                            any determination to revolt. Above all, there was no leadership anywhere
                            except in the regime itself which acted quickly to prevent the spread of
                            unrest by a combination of precautionary measures through police
                            pressure, including student and other arrests, and attempts at
                            pacification through token raising of wages, cultural concessions to
                            Hungarian minorities, and improving student living conditions.</p>
                        <p>After the crushing of the Hungarian revolt by Soviet troops a period of
                            disillusionment set in. Old regime members and former bourgeois turned
                            bitterly against the United States for not intervening with armed
                            forces. The inert population in general found justification for their
                            failure to act and brooded on the fact that they were forgotten by the
                            West. The people as a whole passed through one of their many periods of
                            depression after a few weeks of wild hope, and resumed their normal
                            status of waiting for the next event that would send their
                            wishful-thinking spirits soaring to the skies again. This they soon
                            found in the President’s Middle East doctrine which has tended to raise
                            again their hope that a Third World War will soon come and will start in
                            this part of the world, thus liberating them. Thus, again bathed in
                            blissful expectancy, they are able to endure the hardships of day to day
                            living in a Communist world which every man, woman and child hates with
                            great bitterness. Their disillusionment is gone and the United States
                            will surely be their savior. No action on their part is necessary; they
                            need only wait.</p>
                        <p>The Communist hierarchy was frightened and disappointed by the events in
                            Poland and Hungary. Their feeling of insecurity was apparent not only in
                            the resumption of police pressures but in the most extravagant and
                            almost hysterical phrases used by their representatives in proclaiming
                            the love of the people for the socialist system, and the people’s
                            wholehearted support of the Government in its approval of the Soviet
                            crushing of the Hungarian counter-revolution. Their disappointment was
                            openly expressed by a Politburo member and by Ministry representatives
                            who had seen in the relaxed period a real chance for Rumania to acquire
                            great material and cultural benefits from the West. However, they have
                            never swerved in the slightest degree from their adherence to the Soviet
                            line in every particular, and now have joined the Soviets in virulent
                            attacks against the United States, its foreign policy, its economy and
                            its political institutions. Many explanations can be advanced for these
                            attacks. They are the same, probably, as those which explain similar
                            Soviet attacks, but amongst them I like to think of the explanation that
                            the regime is aware of the great natural admiration which the Rumanian
                            people <pb n="563" xml:id="pg_563" facs="0593"/>have for the United
                            States and its system of “popular capitalism”, and are fearful of the
                            consequences of this ever growing affection and esteem which always
                            survives periods of disillusionment such as our failure to act in the
                            case of Hungary. The smiles and waves and cries of “When are you coming”
                            which I get when I ride around the country in the Legation car flying
                            the American flag are even more numerous and enthusiastic today than
                            they were six months ago. The people during the last year learned to
                            speak out more freely, and they have not yet been scared back to their
                            former silence.</p>
                        <p>In spite of current press articles and political speeches against the
                            United States, and in spite of greater police vigilance, I do not
                            believe that the regime desires or intends to return to the old rigid
                            cold war status. Former privileges to diplomats that came after
                                Geneva<note n="3" xml:id="d230fn3">Reference is to the Geneva Summit
                                meeting, July 1955.</note> have not been peremptorily withdrawn,
                            although warnings in connection therewith have been issued. Cultural
                            relations are being initiated and pressed and personal relations are
                            friendly and cordial. The Rumanian Government is as usual straddling the
                            fence with its customary skill. It is following Soviet instructions and
                            its own inclination to keep its people from becoming too keen on us by
                            attacking us publicly from every angle, and at the same time is keeping
                            the door open for such economic and cultural advantages as it may glean
                            at an appropriate moment.</p>
                        <p>Internally, the Rumanian regime is at last trying to save a
                            disintegrating economy by a series of new moves including the raising of
                            basic wages and the abolishing of agricultural quotas. It is too early
                            to estimate what measure of success they will achieve in their frantic
                            effort to create an incentive that will induce the hostile Rumanian
                            worker and peasant to produce. If the proposals are carried out
                            efficiently both worker and peasant stand to gain substantial benefits.
                            The complicated problems involved, however, and the deplorable
                            efficiency record of Rumanian bureaucracy, would seem to lend
                            considerable weight to the attitude of incredulity and apathy on the
                            part of the Rumanian people toward this effort. The plight of the
                            ordinary Rumanian today is pitiful. He cannot earn for himself and his
                            family enough to survive, and even wholesale stealing on the part of all
                            members of industry, from the worker up to high officials, does not
                            furnish him with nonexistent consumers’ goods or a decent place to live.
                            The peasant and the worker lead lives of misery, and their willingness
                            to endure this existence without rising in revolt is a constant source
                            of wonder.</p>

                        <p>What can the United States do in this country, where the only leadership
                            is in the hands of a united Communist hierarchy which shows no signs of
                            internal dissension, and where the people, though united in their hatred
                            for their leaders and their form of Government, suffer in silence and
                            show not the slightest will to resist?</p>
                        <p>In my last letter, I remarked that due to this lack of will to resist,
                            the Communist guard was down here possibly more than in any other
                            country and this opened up many interesting possibilities. This, of
                            course, is no longer true. The Soviets can be trusted to be watching
                            Rumania, at least for the present, with the same watchful eyes that they
                            are casting upon all the satellites. By the same token, the regime
                            itself will be keeping close tabs on those non-Communist opportunists
                            who, during the period of relaxation, I thought could be persuaded to
                            bring pressure on their bosses for more reliance on the West. Before the
                            revolts in Poland and Hungary, I advocated the use of controlled trade
                            as a means of perhaps setting in motion pressures which the hierarchy
                            would find hard to resist and later to control. This I no longer believe
                            is worth-while trying under present conditions. Furthermore, as a result
                            of recent agreements the Rumanian economy is now so tightly tied to that
                            of the Soviet Union that any advantages they might obtain from us in
                            trade would add directly to the efforts of the Soviet Union to surpass
                            the Western world economically. I feel very strongly therefore that
                            trade between the United States and Rumania should now be held to a
                                minimum.<note n="4" xml:id="d230fn4">Thayer also opposed the
                                continuation of normal trade relations with Romania. He told
                                Romanian officials that “far more dramatic proof” of their sincerity
                                was required beyond what he had called for at the October 1956
                                negotiations. He also strongly recommended that all export licenses
                                be deferred or disapproved for the time being. (Telegram 3201 from

                        <p>I do believe, however, that cultural exchanges between this country and
                            the West redound overwhelmingly in favor of the West and should be
                            encouraged and increased as much as possible. The reasons set forth in
                            my last letter to you remain as valid today as then. We have had
                            occasion here to see and hear the results of the impact of the United
                            States on the trickle of Rumanian visitors who last year began to visit
                            our country. Stories of what they have seen spread like wildfire amongst
                            this rumor-laden population. If you had seen as I did the rising stands
                            of thousands of Rumanians acclaiming three United States athletes
                            marching behind the American flag at an International Track Meet in
                            Bucharest last fall you would appreciate the adulation which these
                            people have for our country and our people. Every Rumanian who goes to
                            the United States and returns and every American who comes over here
                            brings a knowledge and an understanding of the United States which
                            contradicts every word read in the press or <pb n="565" xml:id="pg_565"
                                facs="0595"/>heard over the radio. It sustains far better than
                            anything else possibly could the faith of the people in America and
                            furnishes certain proof of the falsity of Rumanian propaganda.</p>
                        <p>A German General is reported to have said after the last war that the
                            bravest soldiers under his command were Rumanians. Some people believe
                            they have what is termed great explosive courage which rises within them
                            only when they are sparked by inspirational leadership. Such leadership
                            certainly is not visible today. They are, however, being more and more
                            tried by the bungling Rumanian economy, and one continues to hear from
                            time to time prophecies that the peasants are nearing the end of their
                            rope. Time alone will produce an answer. Meanwhile, I believe that we
                            should concentrate on keeping up the faith of the Rumanian people in the
                            American system through a gradual increase in cultural activity, and I
                            sincerely hope that everything possible will be done in the months ahead
                            to develop a comprehensive program of cultural exchanges.<note n="5"

                        <p>The Hungarian puppet regime has followed a consistent, but since the end
                            of December perhaps a more intensive policy not only of removing or
                            weakening resistance centers but also of gaining control over the
                            country’s political and economic life. The Hungarian people are united
                            in their hatred of the <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName>
                            government; but despite this hatred, a number of factors, including
                            economic pressure, fear and the activity of the regime have reduced
                            their capacity for violent action below that of November or early
                            December. In the absence of some substantial change in Hungary’s
                            international environment, the prospects for a considerable period of
                            time are for a Soviet policy of repression against a Hungarian
                            population resisting strongly in every way open to it, but except for
                            sporadic outbreaks, primarily through passive means. The chances for
                            some relaxation on the part of the Soviets or their puppets appear poor
                            in the immediate future; but over a longer period of time, increasing
                            pressures of various kinds may bring some changes for the better,
                            although there is little reason to believe that these will be
                            substantial.</p>
                        <p>[Here follow sections B–E, entitled “Introduction”, “Regime’s Policy”,
                            “Population’s Reaction,” and “Conclusions.”]</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">F. Signs for the Future</hi></p>
                        <p>For the immediate future, the attitude of the regime seems reasonably
                            clear; to extend its controls in scope and in depth as rapidly and as
                            far as possible. No substantial concessions seem likely until these
                            controls have been attained.</p>
                        <p>For the general population, as well as for specific groups and classes
                            among them, there would seem to be two general courses of action
                            possible, which in a sense, but not altogether so, are alternatives. One
                            course is that of active, violent resistance to whatever extent
                            possible; the other is slow passive opposition, to await a gradual
                            softening of attitude on the part of the Russians, and to hope to be
                            able again to force the regime along the path of gradual concessions
                            which it took in 1953–54 and 1956.</p>
                        <p>The first alternative seemed clearly to be the popular choice up to at
                            least the middle of December and to a certain extent well into January.
                            Since that time there has been talk of renewed opposition, including
                            violence, on many fronts in the Spring. Considerable mention has been
                            made of March 15, the old Hungarian National Holiday. People have talked
                            of hidden arms and of underground organizations and of the increasing
                            determination on the part of the people to rid the country of the
                            Soviets or to die in the attempt. What in fact the Spring <pb n="567"
                                xml:id="pg_567" facs="0597"/>will bring is by no means clear. First
                            priority has been given by the regime to organization of the new militia
                            around an old secret police base, and this body is certainly more likely
                            to maintain its loyalty to the regime in the face of public disorder
                            than did the army in October. On the other hand, as its size increases,
                            the chance for disloyalty grows. Nevertheless, considering the steps
                            being taken by the regime in anticipation of trouble and the fact that
                            additional steps will surely be taken in future, it seems that the
                            Government will probably be able to control any outbreaks that should
                            occur without too much difficulty, that is, without calling in Soviet
                            forces in mass. (It can certainly handle almost any conceivable uprising
                            by repeating the October call for assistance to the Soviets.) To make
                            such an assessment so soon after the events of October is, of course, a
                            difficult and dangerous task, and no judgment regarding the future
                            attitude or actions of the Hungarian people can be considered a sure
                            one. Nevertheless, at present, the odds seem to favor a degree of regime
                            power sufficient to handle any situation that is very likely to arise in
                            the Spring.</p>
                        <p>The Legation has heard speculation that the regime might actually provoke
                            uprisings later on with the intent of using these to disclose the
                            remaining insurgent leaders, who could then be picked off with greater
                            ease. The possibility of regime action of this nature is not thought to
                            be very great, however; in view of its growing strength, a method of
                            disclosing opposition leaders which would be both dangerous internally
                            and harmful abroad would not seem warranted.</p>
                        <p>Violence as discussed in preceding paragraphs has been thought of as
                            primarily urban. The mood of the countryside will also be restive,
                            however, and it is very likely that the regime’s control in this area
                            will not be sufficient to prevent sporadic violence. It seems rather
                            unlikely, however, that this could grow to very serious proportions or
                            could achieve a wide organization except on very local levels.</p>
                        <p>If, therefore, violent uprising in the cities and in the countryside will
                            probably not be of sufficient magnitude to threaten the regime’s
                            physical control, does this mean that the population will fall back on
                            the longer-term tactic of passive resistance? And if so, what can they
                            hope to achieve, in the absence of great international changes? Does
                            past Soviet experience in Hungary dictate that the present policy of
                            repression be continued forever? As indicated, present policy seems to
                            point to the conclusion that the Soviets will be much more chary of
                            concessions in the future than in the past. But can a policy of this
                            nature continue for a year as easily as for a month, for six years as
                            easily as for six months?</p>
                        <p>Clearly, in a long-term battle of this nature, the experience and the
                            determination of both sides has been increased. The Soviets have seen
                            where concessions have led them; the determination of the Hungarians to
                            win their freedom has increased. The situation is different <pb n="568"

                        <p>There remains, of course, essentially unchanged from the past, the basic
                            difficulty of continuing a harsh line; that the pressure for concessions
                            will be heavy, continuous and broad, and that one concession breeds
                            another.</p>
                        <p>Other questions in this connection are 1) the reaction of the Soviets to
                            the Hungarian attitude over a period of time, in other words, in an
                            unchanged international situation, are the Soviets more likely to relax
                            in Hungary if the Hungarians are quiescent and work well than if they
                            continually strain and tug at their chains and let the country go to
                            wrack and ruin? In which direction should United States (and Western)
                            influence bear? No definite answer can be given to these questions, but
                            the examples of Czechoslovakia and Rumania would seem to point to a
                            negative answer to the first.</p>
                        <p>The general conclusion to which the above analysis, which is based
                            primarily on our appraisal of local Hungarian developments, brings the

                            with problem of how to treat war of nerves which Hung population waging

                        <p>Legation of opinion every logical analysis of situation leads to
                            evaluation March 15 will not bring renewal widespread open revolt. But
                            Legation does not feel certain logical analysis is adequate, since
                            convincing logic, alien to their rationale, may fail give enough weight
                            to possibility of illogical behavior.</p>
                        <p>In view of fact Hungarians may conceivably decide once more to take on
                            Soviets, Legation makes following recommendations to media: (1) Any
                            discussion of March 15 should implicitly carry message renewed outburst
                            anywhere near scale of one in October would in eyes of Western world
                            seem an excess, since Hungarians have already demonstrated how they feel
                            about Soviets and Commies; (2) Media <pb n="570" xml:id="pg_570"
                                facs="0600"/>should explicitly point out so-called <persName

                            After all that has happened and been said since October–November it
                            should seem clear Hungarians should not expect Western aid in event they
                            revolt. However, President’s Middle East speech has created some hope,
                            apparently for most part among urban workers, that United States policy
                            is shifting in direction of granting aid against Commie aggression for
                            any nation which requests it. Although Legation does not view with alarm
                            or disfavor any or all strong actions which Hungarians may take against
                            their oppressors, it feels our media cannot be too explicit on point
                            about our Middle East policies implying no extension to East Europe. One
                            Legation officer has had painful task of making this ABC clear to
                            several Hungarians (urban workers) who say they are involved in
                            underground networks.</p>
                        <p>Choices of strong action on part of Hungarians are strictly limited.
                            Possibility of armed and open revolt certainly offers no reward of
                            success. Possibility of terrorizing the regime by assassinating Commie
                            officials and police offers potentially greater rewards, especially if
                            Soviets were excluded as targets and secret terror actions were paced so
                            as to strike fear into government supporters without provoking wholesale
                            reprisals against innocent people. However, Hungarians, who pride
                            themselves on a non-Balkan civilization, have never shown genius for
                            this type action. If contrary to their past, they should, amid present
                            adversities, develop attitude for fighting terror by terror, Legation is
                            of opinion United States media could adopt a noncommittal attitude. But
                            on matter of open uprising, with inevitable consequences of defeat
                            further loss of leadership and undermining underground communications
                            media record should be crystal clear. This clearness should not only be
                            formal; it should take into account possibility uneducated workers may
                            misunderstand us in way we ordinarily would not expect to be
                            misunderstood.</p>
                        <p>Toward end giving media ammunition with which make these views known
                            without commentaries or editorializing, Legation offers suggestion that
                            high-ranking United States figure possibly Under Secretary, make use of
                            press conference to plant ideas (possible Legation [idea] is that March
                            15 is State holiday in Ohio; Hungarians in Ohio will also celebrate

                            to Hungary?</p>

                        <p>The Hungarian people are continuing to resist the regime imposed on them
                            by the Soviet forces. That resistance is taking the form of strikes and
                            other actions resulting in the disruption of production and a shortage
                            of goods. The regime is attempting to consolidate its hold <pb n="572"
                                xml:id="pg_572" facs="0602"/>over the people and compel them to
                            accept its domination. It is our policy not to provide assistance which
                            will strengthen the <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName>
                            regime.</p>
                        <p>From a political viewpoint, it is important that the United States carry
                            out an expanded relief program to the Hungarian people. It is certain
                            that the Soviets will endeavor to exploit any economic aid to Hungary
                            from the West for the purpose of entrenching a regime submissive to its
                            control, and for this reason we are opposed to furnishing economic aid
                            directly to the Hungarian Government. However, if assistance in some
                            form is not forthcoming from the West the USSR will undoubtedly furnish
                            enough assistance to keep the economy going and exploit the abandonment
                            by the West as a means of exerting greater pressure on the population
                            for cooperation with the existing regime. Expanded relief assistance
                            from the U.S. distributed directly to the Hungarian people, whether or
                            not the situation is entirely desperate or supplies could be obtained
                            from the USSR, would prove that the Hungarian people have not been
                            abandoned by us. This would hold true even if the Soviets or the
                            Hungarian regime prevented the implementation of the program.</p>
                        <p>Relief supplies are currently being provided to Hungary through the
                            International Committee of the Red Cross, under its agreement with the
                            Hungarian Red Cross. Supplies being furnished at present levels,
                            however, will not meet the needs of the Hungarian people in the interim
                            before the next harvest. A period of real hardship is in prospect for
                            the Hungarian people. It is proposed that the present U.S. relief
                            program be expanded to take care of the pending relief needs, provided
                            the United States aid would help the Hungarian people as distinct from
                            the regime and could be furnished on terms satisfactory to the United
                            States. (Tab D<note n="2" xml:id="d233fn2">Tabs A–E are not printed.

                        <p>The provision of supplies by the United States in a manner consistent
                            with the need, on the one hand, and the U.S. policy of non-support of
                            the <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> regime, on the other,
                            will raise problems in connection with operations within Hungary and may
                            also involve making arrangements with European governments to supply
                            needed commodities on a reimbursable basis in advance of shipments from
                            the United States. It is thought that a procedure through the ICRC
                            and/or the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> might offer a solution
                            which would permit direct distribution to needy people with a minimum of
                            interference by the Hungarian government.</p>
                        <pb n="573" xml:id="pg_573" facs="0603"/>
                        <p>As an example of the kind of problem facing the Hungarian people there
                            may be noted a prospective wheat deficit of about 200,000 tons. Cost of
                            covering the entire gap in the form of flour from U.S. sources would be
                            $33 million (at <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> cost). It is not
                            proposed to cover this entire amount but rather to see if it is
                            feasible, given policy and operational considerations, to supply about
                            one-fourth of the prospective deficiency at this time. Other items will
                            be furnished as needed to obtain a balanced relief program. A sizeable
                            increase in the present relief program would require expansion of the
                            facilities of ICRC. The feasibility of administering an expanded program
                            would need to be discussed with other government agencies, the ICRC and
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. It is contemplated that the
                            operation of the program would be carefully phased to insure conformance
                            to U.S. objectives at each step.</p>
                        <p>At the present time representatives of the ICRC are in Washington
                            discussing with us their program for an expanded relief effort in
                            Hungary which includes a proposal to channel relief supplies on a
                            commercial basis through the distribution facilities maintained by the
                            Hungarian government.<note n="3" xml:id="d233fn3">These discussions have
                                since terminated. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> The sales
                            proceeds of relief supplies would be used by the Hungarian Red Cross,
                            acting under the supervision of the ICRC, to furnish relief assistance
                            in the form of local currency to needy Hungarians, to pay the
                            administrative expenses of the ICRC and HRC and for the repair of
                            hospitals. The ICRC believes the Hungarian Red Cross currently is
                            practically independent of the <persName corresp="#p_KJ1"
                                >Kadar</persName> regime and is likely to remain so if the HRC can
                            financially support its relief activities without recourse to the
                            regime. While the latter situation may be subject to some doubt, the HRC
                            is a channel which is identified with the Hungarian people. This program
                            of commercial distribution of relief supplies would be supplemented by
                            free relief aid distributions directly to needy Hungarians.</p>
                        <p>The ICRC representatives appear to attach great importance to an expanded
                            Hungarian relief program utilizing commercial distribution facilities on
                            the grounds that the magnitude of the probable requirements could only
                            be met effectively by such distribution facilities and this method would
                            have the additional advantage of generating local currency for the
                            purpose of furnishing relief aid on a broader, more flexible and
                            diversified basis to needy Hungarians. For example, with relief funds
                            the needy Hungarians could buy clothing, blankets, soap and toilet
                            articles on the local market. The ICRC representatives have also raised
                            the question of their operating and administrative expenses incurred in
                            bringing relief supplies to the Hungarian frontier. As a neutral
                            international relief agency, the ICRC appears to be unconcerned with our
                            political problem of trying to minimize the effects of relief aid on
                            strengthening the <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> regime.
                            There is a possibility, <pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574" facs="0604"
                            />moreover, that if we do not achieve a satisfactory accommodation with
                            the ICRC, that agency which serves as our principal access for
                            furnishing relief to the Hungarian people will reduce its relief efforts
                            in Hungary and will justify such action as being necessary because the
                            United States was unwilling to adopt the most feasible method of
                            furnishing relief on a mass basis to the Hungarian people.</p>
                        <p>The issues are whether (a) the United States should undertake an expanded
                            relief effort for the Hungarian people and (b) such relief effort can be
                            executed by the ICRC on terms acceptable to the United States. On the
                            latter question, we believe the ICRC is anxious to undertake an expanded
                            relief program and, to that end, will agree to a negotiated arrangement
                            for the distribution of relief supplies. We have in mind a negotiated
                            arrangement along the following lines: (a) The United States would be
                            prepared to participate in an expanded relief program for Hungary,
                            involving the provision of increased amounts of foodstuffs and of
                            limited quantities of feed grains for farm animals, (b) foodstuffs and
                            feed grains of U.S. origin would be distributed directly and gratis to
                            the Hungarian people, (c) if the ICRC is insistent on using commercial
                            distribution channels, the United States would agree not to discourage
                            other friendly governments from furnishing relief supplies for
                            distribution in limited amounts through commercial facilities provided
                            the local currency proceeds were used to finance the distribution costs
                            and administrative expenses of the ICRC and the HRC for relief
                            activities in Hungary, and the balance of such funds promptly
                            distributed on a nondiscriminatory basis, under the supervision of the
                            ICRC, to needy Hungarians and (d) if the ICRC demonstrates a need for
                            operating funds over and above those obtainable from other sources,
                            including the private voluntary agencies, we would be prepared to pay a
                            share of such costs out of the Section 401 funds made available for an
                            expanded Hungarian relief program.</p>

                        <p>A decision to expand the program of relief assistance to Hungary raises a
                            number of related policy questions discussed in more detail in the
                            attachments and enumerated below:</p>
                        <p>1. Should the United States be prepared to furnish assistance on an
                            accelerated and expanded scale to the Hungarian people to meet a part of
                            prospective resource deficiencies and on a properly safeguarded basis
                            which would relieve hardship among the people but not alleviate to any
                            appreciable degree the economic problems of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> regime?</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Recommendation:</hi></p>
                        <p>That the United States be prepared to furnish such assistance to the
                            Hungarian people.</p>
                        <p>2. If expanded assistance is approved, on what basis would it be
                            furnished, in what amount and for what duration?</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Recommendation:</hi></p>
                        <p>That the United States be prepared to furnish as necessary, relief
                            assistance to the Hungarian people in an additional amount up to $20
                            million in surplus foods (under Title II, <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                                >PL</gloss> 480) and, for non-surplus relief supplies such as
                            medicines, and to cover other costs (including a share of ICRC operating
                            expenses if necessary), $5 million from Mutual Security Act funds
                            available under Section 401 in order to meet the immediate needs of the
                            Hungarian people in accordance with the principles and objectives set
                            forth in this memorandum. This assistance would be in addition to and
                            would be integrated with the relief program now being implemented. To
                            the maximum practicable extent relief supplies would be furnished free
                            and directly to the Hungarian people to cover their relief needs until
                            the new crop is harvested in August.</p>
                        <p>It is contemplated on the basis of the present information that about
                            40,000 tons of flour estimated at $10 million in terms of <gloss
                                target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> cost and about $10 million of other
                            surplus agricultural products (rice, dried milk and feed grains) would
                            be furnished as necessary. The $5 million of Section 401 funds would be
                            used for non-surplus relief supplies such as medicines and to defray the
                            costs of inland transportation in Europe, handling, distribution and
                            other costs related to the furnishing of $20 million of surplus
                            agricultural products.</p>
                        <pb n="576" xml:id="pg_576" facs="0606"/>
                        <p>It may be necessary to make additional allocations of authority and funds
                            in the light of the developing situation. It is recommended that you be
                            prepared to consider recommendations for such allocations. Expenditures
                            will be kept under continuous review. (Tabs A and D).</p>
                        <p>3. Should the United States as part of its efforts to furnish expanded
                            relief assistance to the Hungarian people take steps where necessary to
                            arrange with other European governments to provide food on a
                            reimbursable basis pending arrival of shipments of like foodstuffs from
                            the U.S.?</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Recommendation:</hi></p>
                        <p>It is recommended that you approve approaches to other European
                            governments, e.g., Germany, Austria, Italy, to obtain their agreement to
                            advance food on a reimbursable basis for U.S. use in assisting the
                            people in Hungary under an expanded relief program.</p>
                        <p>4. Should United States relief assistance be channelled through the
                            United Nations, if practical arrangements consistent with our policy
                            objective can be made with the United Nations?</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Recommendation:</hi></p>
                        <p>That you approve the principle that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            be associated with U.S. relief assistance to a degree mutually agreeable
                            to the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, provided such
                            assistance is limited primarily to a relief program over which
                            appropriate United States influence would be exerted. (Tabs B and
                            D).</p>
                        <p>5. (a) Should the U.S. encourage other friendly countries to furnish
                            relief assistance to the Hungarian people within a political framework
                            not inconsistent with that adopted by us and (b) should the U.S.
                            acquiesce in friendly countries furnishing exports on a loan or other
                            credit basis directly to the <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName>
                            regime?</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Recommendation:</hi></p>
                        <p>That you approve the principle that the U.S. (a) will encourage other
                            friendly countries to furnish relief assistance and, within that
                            context, indicate to them that the US would not object to some of their
                            relief supplies being channelled through commercial distribution
                            channels, provided the local currency proceeds were used to pay as
                            needed some of the administrative and operating expenses of the ICRC and
                            HRC and the balance of such funds were promptly distributed on a
                            non-discriminatory basis, under the supervision of the ICRC, to needy
                            Hungarians, and (b) will discourage other friendly countries <pb n="577"
                                xml:id="pg_577" facs="0607"/>from extending loans and credits to the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> regime on the grounds
                            that such actions would undermine the resistance of the Hungarian people
                            to the regime. (Tab C).</p>
                        <p>6. Should the Department undertake to initiate courses of action by the
                            other interested government agencies and private organizations which
                            will result in the execution of an expanded relief program for the
                            Hungarian people, consistent with our policy of minimizing any indirect
                            benefits to the <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> regime?</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Recommendation:</hi></p>
                        <p>That you approve action by the Department to enter into necessary
                            arrangements to obtain execution of an expanded relief assistance
                            program at the earliest practicable date to the Hungarian people. Such a
                            program, however, should be embarked upon and utilized primarily to
                            strengthen the Hungarian people in their resistance against the Soviet
                            dominated regime.</p>
                        <p>7. In light of (a) the ICRC estimate that the capability for direct food
                            relief activities in Hungary probably could not be increased to reach
                            more than 1 million people (about 200,000 families) mostly in Budapest
                            and (b) its proposal that relief supplies be channelled increasingly on
                            a commercial basis through normal distribution facilities with the sales
                            proceeds to be used primarily for relief activities, what should be the
                            guidelines for our negotiations with the ICRC?</p>

                                would be prepared to pay a portion of such unfunded expenses out of

                                aspirations exploded into crisis last fall as a result of the
                                progressive weakening of ideological authority and loosening of
                                police controls following the death of Stalin.<note n="3"

                                experiencing great difficulty in formulating and putting into effect
                                policies which will reduce this crisis to manageable proportions.

                            <item>We believe that the USSR will continue to regard the Satellite
                                area as vital to its interests, and will not seriously entertain, at
                                least for the next several years, the possibility of a general
                                political or military withdrawal, even in return for a withdrawal of
                                US forces from Europe. To the Soviet leaders, loss of control over
                                Eastern Europe would constitute a severe setback for Communism. They
                                would also view it as rendering them powerless to prevent German
                                reunification, and as seriously impairing the USSR’s strategic
                                position. (Paras. 11, 27)</item>

                            <item>We believe that the Soviet leaders have concluded from the events
                                of recent months that although reforms in certain fields were
                                acceptable, concessions to nationalist pressures involve hazards to

                            <item>Poland’s success in maintaining its present limited degree of
                                independence is a key factor affecting the future political
                                developments in Eastern Europe. Should the USSR succeed in
                                reimposing its complete control over Poland, it could more easily
                                check dissident elements in other Satellites, particularly
                                disruptive forces in the other Satellite Communist parties. If the
                                USSR does not achieve its aim in Poland, its problems elsewhere will
                                probably worsen. (Para. 49)</item>

                                action would almost certainly be resisted by the bulk of the Polish
                                nation and armed forces, and thus involve Soviet forces in
                                large-scale military operations, which could spread to East Germany
                                and thus provoke a major international crisis. (Paras. 31–33)</item>

                            <item>Soviet success in repairing its losses in Poland, however, would
                                not remove the underlying causes of disaffection throughout the
                                Satellites. Tensions between the Satellite populations and their
                                regimes during the next several years probably will be higher than
                                prior to the events in Poland and Hungary, and the unity of
                                Satellite parties will be subjected to greater strains. Soviet
                                policy is not likely to reduce these tensions in Eastern Europe, or
                                even to restore the degree of acquiescence prevailing earlier.

                                that we may have to admit additional numbers if the refugee influx

                                whole immigration program, now before the Congress, was concerned.
                                He predicted that the Congress would be violently opposed to the

                                because they had escaped from Hungary to Yugoslavia rather than to
                                Austria. The President’s comment was that the Congress and a good
                                many of the rest of us all seem capable of forgetting that we were
                                descendants ourselves of refugees of the past.</p>
                            <p>“A suggestion was then made for consultation with leading members of

                                would be no harm in sounding out Congressional leaders with regard
                                to the <persName corresp="#p_HLW1">Henderson</persName>
                                recommendations; but that the prospects for the President’s
                                immigration programs generally were dim as regards favorable
                                Congressional action this year. The Vice President agreed
                                emphatically with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                    >Dulles</persName> that there was no logic in the Congressional

                                differently from those who had fled to Austria. Nevertheless, since
                                Congress felt as it appeared to feel, it might be better to try to
                                deal with the <persName corresp="#p_HLW1">Henderson</persName>
                                recommendations only after favorable action by the Congress on the

                            Hungarian refugees in Yugoslavia. The Ambassador was told “that the US
                            hoped to help the Yugoslav authorities with agricultural commodities and
                            perhaps some release of US-held <pb n="581" xml:id="pg_581" facs="0611"
                            />local currency funds. Moreover, although it would not be possible to
                            bring Hungarian refugees from Yugoslavia into the US on parole pending
                            enactment by Congress of the Administration-sponsored immigration
                            legislation, the US was hoping to find several million dollars to help
                            other countries in Europe and elsewhere resettle the refugees. However,
                            this was not yet to be taken as a US commitment since the US project was
                            in the exploratory stage. Ambassador Mates declared that he fully
                            understood, but was still happy to hear that the US was actively trying
                            to aid Yugoslavia.” (Memorandum of conversation by <persName

                        <p>According to a paper prepared in the Department of State on February 20,
                            it was “the purpose of the United States to encourage the continuation
                            of the Polish liberalization movement by opening the prospect of
                            economic advantage to Poland through expanding economic relations with
                            the West.” The degree of Poland’s independence from the Soviet Union was
                            the decisive element in determining how much economic cooperation was
                            possible. The importance was stressed of making clear to the Poles and
                            to the American press and Congress “that the significance of the
                            discussions lies in the beginning that has been made looking toward the
                            widening of future economic relations rather than in the specific trade
                            arrangements to be worked out at this time.” In addition to whatever
                            “limited agreements” might be reached, it was anticipated that the talks
                            would provide a “basis for preparing an economic agenda for the future
                            discussions which are expected to take place concerning all outstanding
                            US-Polish problems” and a basis for consideration by the United States
                            of the desirability of further, longer-term, economic assistance to
                            Poland. This paper and a complete record of the negotiations is in

                            again to do so by Hungarian authorities, he wondered whether he should
                            “leave before I may be thrown out—to which I would recommend the answer

                            existence and especially with the fact that I hesitate to leave Hungary
                            for even a short ‘breather’ as the chances of my returning are not too

                            vote taken the previous day it had adopted a United States motion “that
                            the Committee take no decision regarding the credentials submitted on
                            behalf of the representatives of Hungary”. (A/3536) This enabled the
                            Hungarians to participate provisionally in United Nations affairs. The
                            United States decided neither to defer action on nor to seek rejection
                            of the Hungarians’ credentials because of the “potentially serious
                            implications” for the Chinese representation problem. (<gloss

                            and should take all feasible action to support the principle of asylum
                            for those fleeing from persecution, including opposition to their
                            involuntary repatriation. To this end, the United States should support
                            and extend its own and international programs to assist Free World
                            countries in maintaining liberal policies of asylum and in developing
                            effective facilities and procedures therefor. The countries of asylum
                            should be encouraged <pb n="585" xml:id="pg_585" facs="0615"/>either to

                            Communist oppression, the Free World countries, including the United

                            and the Free World. Such assistance demonstrates U.S. concern for the
                            captive peoples of Eastern Europe and sustains the defector program. The
                            nature of the U.S. interest is affected by the former nationality,
                            circumstances, numbers and relation to U.S. objectives of the

                            Toward precluding the involuntary repatriation of Yugoslav national
                            escapees, the United States should provide a limited form of assistance
                            which reflects the extent of U.S. interest in this group in relation to
                            other escapees. This assistance should take into special account the
                            willingness and capacities of the asylum countries bordering on
                            Yugoslavia to make the maximum contribution of their own to this
                            purpose, as well as the availability of assistance from international
                            agencies and private groups.</p>
                        <p>13. The United States should continue to assist satellite escapees who
                            are within Yugoslavia and desire to leave, to resettle elsewhere in the
                            Free World.</p>
                        <p>14. The United States should continue to further general U.S. policy
                            objectives by providing assistance and resettlement at approximately
                            current levels and on a selective basis, to limited numbers of Chinese
                            who have fled from Communist China directly to territories other than
                            that of the Republic of China.</p>
                        <p>15. The United States should continue its efforts, and seek to persuade
                            other Free World countries, to combat the Sino-Soviet bloc repatriation
                            campaign. Every individual has the right voluntarily to return to his
                            home, but the United States should continue its own efforts, and seek to
                            persuade other Free World countries, to take reasonable measures (a) to
                            assure adequacy of treatment by countries of asylum and of resettlement,
                            and (b) to prevent repatriation by coercion or false representation.</p>
                        <pb n="588" xml:id="pg_588" facs="0618"/>
                        <p>16. The existing situation in countries of asylum overseas for Hungarian
                            escapees presents a unique problem of great magnitude which, if not
                            promptly dealt with, could have long-range and costly consequences to
                            the Free World. The United States to date has played a significant role
                            in assisting Hungarian escapees. For these reasons, in carrying out
                            paragraph 9, the United States should emphasize action during Calendar
                            Year 1957 (1) to encourage countries of asylum overseas to make maximum
                            efforts to care for, integrate, or resettle Hungarian escapees, and (2)
                            to supplement such efforts with U.S. interim material assistance and
                            interim aid, to the end that such escapees receive adequate care in
                            countries of asylum on a substantially equal basis within each such
                            country, and reasonable opportunity for early permanent
                            resettlement.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Psychological Exploitation</hi></p>
                        <p>17. The United States should restrict its psychological exploitation of
                            defectors and escapees, by radio or otherwise, to specific cases where a
                            net advantage can be expected. In each case, due consideration should be
                            given both to the possible adverse propaganda effects of possible
                            subsequent redefection or return. . . .</p>
                        <p>18. The United States should continue to adhere to its policy of not
                            publicizing its assistance to Yugoslav escapees.</p>
                        <p>19. During a mass exodus, U.S. controlled media should not encourage
                            persons to flight. Favorable aspects of treatment of escapees in Free
                            World countries should not be so emphasized to the country from which
                            flight proceeds as to increase the exodus—to the net detriment of U.S.
                            interests; but the facts may be given concerning U.S. participation with
                            other Free World countries in humanitarian assistance in countries of
                            immediate asylum. Where appropriate and feasible emphasis should be
                            placed on U.S. assistance to the population which remains in the
                            homeland, rather than on aid given to escapees.</p>

                        <p>Despite the unfortunate extent to which the Communists retain control
                            over the present Polish Government, the Polish people themselves have
                            made a determined and courageous fight to win some degree of national
                            independence from the Soviet Union. They appear to have been at least
                            temporarily successful in lessening the iron control that the Soviets
                            have hitherto exercised over their lives—and their ability and
                            willingness to turn to this nation for assistance for the first time
                            should be encouraged, not castigated. If there is even a slight chance
                            that this demonstration of friendship on our part will help the Polish
                            people to loosen further the bonds of Soviet domination, then the
                            obvious gains to this nation and the Free World will have been well
                            worth the effort. If, on the other hand, Poland should once again slip
                            completely behind the Iron Curtain, then this nation will have at least
                            demonstrated to the world our willingness to help impoverished people in
                            any land, whatever the political situation may be.</p>
                        <p>I recognize, of course, that others have pointed out advantages for us in
                            refusing aid to the Poles—it will make matters more difficult for their
                            Communist government and absentee Soviet masters, and it will
                            demonstrate our recognition of the degree to which the Polish Government
                            is still within the orbit of Soviet control and ideology. But hunger has
                            never been a weapon of American foreign policy—and if we can score these
                            “cold-war” advantages only by turning a deaf ear to Polish hunger and
                            misery, then we will have won only a dubious “victory” at best.</p>
                        <p>It is true, too, that we have thus far looked in vain for any Polish move
                            to better relations between our nations—such as lifting those
                            restrictions that make it difficult for Polish citizens to accept
                            private gifts of food and other material from relatives and friends in
                            this country. But these issues can never be settled satisfactorily if
                            this nation refuses to negotiate on their requests to us.</p>

                        <p>As a result of the systematic policy of economic and political
                            exploitation the Russians have carried out within Poland in the last
                            decade, the Polish people are extremely hard-pressed to maintain even a
                            minimum standard of living. This economic problem is being accentuated
                            by the fact that many thousands of Poles previously deported to Siberia
                            are now returning to their native land homeless, hungry, destitute, and
                            in poor health.</p>
                        <p>I visited Poland less than two years ago,<note n="3" xml:id="d239fn3"
                                >Kennedy visited Poland in September 1955. Documentation on this

                            know first-hand of the population’s rejection of Communist philosophy.
                            Poland may still be a satellite government—but the Poles are not
                            satellite people. To deny them help because they have not been able to
                            shake off total Communist control would be a brutal and dangerous
                            policy, either increasing their dependence on Russia or driving them
                            into the slaughter of a fruitless, premature revolt.</p>
                        <p>Such assistance, of course, should contain the strongest possible
                            safeguards to prevent its exploitation for political purposes by the
                            Polish Government. Particular attention should be focused on those forms
                            of assistance which will be of direct benefit to the Polish people, such
                            as the shipment of surplus foodstuffs and the sale of farm
                            machinery.</p>
                        <p>I realize, of course, that international political considerations are
                            involved here; but, important as these considerations are, they should
                            not obscure the basic human values at stake.</p>

                                    a large measure of popular support. Mr. <persName

                            impression that <gloss target="#t_BBC1">BBC</gloss> attempted to give
                            publicity to a stay-off-the-streets demonstration between 1400 and 1500
                            hours. <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> has been accused in the

                            not monitored <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> sufficiently to judge
                            whether this accusation is true. <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>, as
                            far as the Legation is aware, treated March 15 in a general, historical
                            manner.</p>
                        <p>The Legation believes that the outcome of March 15 reveals, above all,
                            the falsity of regime propaganda assertions that when the Hungarian
                            people are moved to anti-regime demonstrations they are moved by Western
                            propaganda, primarily the radio media. In light of the results, the
                            Legation also believes it behooves the media to exercise the utmost
                            modesty when appraising their ability to guide or maneuver the Hungarian
                            people into a desired direction. Apropos this caution, the Legation
                            recalls seeing a <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> magazine article in which
                                <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>
                            <pb n="592" xml:id="pg_592" facs="0622"/>seemed to credit its broadcasts
                            with a major role in shaping the fifteen-point student demands of last
                            October, which included such matters as free elections and a multi-party
                            political system. It borders on the fantastic to assert that any outside
                            source supplied these ideas, which are the general inheritance of the
                            West and well-known in Hungary. The clear fact is that there was
                            considerable internal strength for the realization of these ideas, which
                            was probably encouraged by the support it received in Hungarian-language
                            broadcasts from the West.</p>
                        <p>An amorphous internal will toward a March 15 demonstration was certainly
                            present a number of weeks before the holiday. In face of the security
                            build-up carried out by the <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName>
                            regime and the Russians as March 15 approached, this would, had it
                            persisted, have amounted to no more than dangerous willfulness. In any
                            event the will was not present by zero hour, and it is most likely that
                            even if the US media, presumably like the British, had publicized a
                            silent demonstration, the results of March 15 would have been the same,
                            namely: people would have gone about their normal business, shopping in
                            stores, strolling with their children, sitting in parks, and
                            working.</p>
                        <p>The gauging of the internal will of the Hungarian people to specific
                            overt acts against the regime will probably become increasingly
                            difficult. However, it is too much to expect that they will support a
                            dangerous action which is openly announced weeks ahead of time. They
                            will in all probability take it for what it may have been meant to be on
                            March 15, a phase in a war of nerves. Even those more audacious elements
                            of the population who, if encouraged, might have been susceptible to
                            irrational behavior on March 15 will probably now be swayed toward a
                            game of waiting, in which timing with international events will form an
                            important impetus to action. If this analysis is correct, any attempt by
                            Western radio to stimulate a maneuver will almost certainly end in
                            fiasco. Without detracting one bit from the news-carrying value of the
                            media, it can safely be said that what the United States is and does
                            means far more to the Hungarians than what it says. Until such time as
                            the West feels it possible to give actual help to the Hungarian people
                            in their fight or to create a more fluid European situation, it will
                            almost certainly be the better part of wisdom for the media to refrain
                            from giving the Hungarians advice (even concealed advice) in specific
                            conditions of danger. The media, like the Hungarian people, have to live
                            with the hard fact that the Soviet-supported <persName corresp="#p_KJ1"
                                >Kadar</persName> regime has succeeded in gaining more surface
                            control of the situation in Hungary than most observers would have
                            thought possible a month or two ago.</p>

                        <p>On Monday February 25th, I called Mr. Caius Frantescu, the Chief of
                            Protocol, to discuss with him the matter of travel regulations, with
                            particular reference to the question as to whether Lt. Col. K. G.
                                Taylor<note n="3" xml:id="d243fn3">Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth G.
                                Taylor, U.S. Army Attaché.</note> would be able to motor through the
                            Oradea district on his way out to Vienna to meet his wife who was
                            returning from a protracted illness in the United States. In the course
                            of this conversation, I casually mentioned that sometime when convenient
                            I would like to see the Foreign Minister and have a general discussion
                            with him about U.S.-Rumanian relations. I said that I hadn’t had a chat
                            with him since he had left before Christmas for the United Nations
                            meetings, and that although there was no great rush I would appreciate
                            the chance of talking to him. A few days later, at a moving picture
                            showing at the Diplomatic Club sponsored by our Legation, Mr. Frantescu
                            volunteered the information that he had already spoken to the Foreign
                            Minister about a meeting with us. Two days later he called me to say
                            that the Foreign Minister was very sorry he had not been able to see me
                            that week but he would surely do so sometime during the coming week.</p>
                        <p>Thereafter about ten days went by with no word whatsoever, and I
                            therefore called Mr. Frantescu, who said he had no answer but would
                            pursue the matter. Another week went by, and I finally called again and
                            said that although several weeks before when I first requested an
                            appointment I had been in no special hurry, time had sped by with no
                            results, and now certain matters began to be pressing. Mr. Frantescu
                            replied that he was constantly reminding the Minister of my request and
                            had been insisting that an appointment be made. (It should be noted that
                            this is the first time that I have ever had to wait more than three or
                            at most five days to get an appointment with the Foreign Minister.)</p>
                        <p>It was at the beginning of the fourth week since I had requested an
                            appointment that I met Mr. Frantescu in the gallery of the Chamber of
                            the Grand National Assembly on the occasion of its recent meeting. <pb
                                n="596" xml:id="pg_596" facs="0626"/>I at once reminded him that it
                            was now three weeks since I had made my original request, and that I had
                            always understood that international diplomatic usage gave a Minister
                            the right to demand to see the Foreign Minister, which the latter could
                            not refuse. Mr. Frantescu led me aside away from eavesdroppers and said
                            that he frankly was personally very much embarrassed by the situation,
                            and so was the Foreign Minister; but the latter had been told not to see
                            me until the Rumanian Government had made an important decision
                            regarding Rumanian-United States relations. The Minister was therefore
                            powerless to do anything and, as I could well see, the Government at the
                            moment was completely absorbed in the proceedings before the Grand
                            National Assembly and nothing could be expected until they were over. I
                            asked whether the decision involved something pleasant or unpleasant in
                            our relations, and Mr. Frantescu replied that he hadn’t the slightest
                            idea what it was all about. He stressed that he had had no business to
                            tell me as much as he had, and he begged me to keep it very much to
                            myself. Later on in the morning I again had him repeat what he had told
                            me, and received another assurance that he had no inkling as to the
                            nature of the so-called “decision.”</p>
                        <p>Under the above circumstances the problem presented to the Legation was
                            to determine what action, if any, could be taken to influence in any way
                            the Rumanian Government in coming to this “decision”, in the absence of
                            any clue as to what this decision was. Since no negotiations were at the
                            moment pending on any question, the matter to be decided must, it would
                            seem, necessarily be a question of whether the Rumanian Government
                            should take some action either favorable or unfavorable towards the
                            United States. The objective of favorable action would be to create a
                            climate in which the United States would be disposed to grant export
                            licenses for the materials which the Rumanian Minister is at present
                            actively privately negotiating with various business concerns in the
                            United States, notably in the chemical industry. The objective of
                            unfavorable action would be to assist the Soviets, as had been done by
                            other members of the bloc, in their campaign to show the world,
                            particularly the masses in Asia and Africa, that espionage and
                            subversion was back of the Hungarian revolt and that therefore their
                            violent measures in Hungary were justified. In view of the tenor of not
                            only press attacks but also the current speeches in the Grand National
                            Assembly, particularly that of Prime Minister Stoica emphasizing U.S.
                            espionage and calling for it to halt,<note n="4" xml:id="d243fn4">In
                                telegram 567 from Bucharest, March 22, Thayer indicated his belief
                                that a formal protest should be lodged against the “unwarranted and
                                false allegations” made by Romanian Prime Minister Chivu Stoica in
                                his speech. (Department of State, Central Files, 766.13/3–2257) The
                                Department of State replied to Thayer in telegram 331, March 25,
                                that it was not “general practice to protest formally such
                                propaganda charges.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.)</note> it
                            appeared that unfavorable action was more likely since favorable action
                            would seem anomalous in the existing climate. The <pb n="597"
                                xml:id="pg_597" facs="0627"/>unfavorable action most conforming to
                            precedent in other countries of the Soviet bloc, and most logical as a
                            denouement to all of the verbal accusations, would be the declaration of
                            someone such as a Military Attaché as Persona Non Grata and his
                            expulsion.</p>
                        <p>It has been my personal experience since I have been here that the most
                            effective attitude to adopt towards the Communist regime is a
                            combination of personal friendliness and official firmness and severity.
                            In personal relations they have, all of them, a definite inferiority
                            complex, and they respond to personal warmth with a certain amount of
                            surprise and eagerness. This is particularly true in this country where
                            even the top members of the hierarchy are Latins and Western in their
                            orientation. On the other hand, they understand hard dealing and respect
                            it, and I have never failed to get action as a result of extreme
                            firmness to the point of almost violence on a matter where it was clear
                            that the United States had a justifiable case. I therefore determined to
                            carry out a campaign on this basis covering the few days remaining
                            before the end of the Grand National Assembly Meeting, after which it
                            could be expected that the “decision” would come up for
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>This campaign consisted of visiting the Chamber of the Grand National
                            Assembly daily and making myself as agreeable as possible personally to
                            every official of the Rumanian Government that I knew, as well as to the
                            members of the Eastern Diplomatic corps, particularly the Soviet
                            Ambassador. A moving picture at my residence was organized for children
                            of the diplomatic corps and to it there were invited the children of
                            some Eastern diplomats, the first social invitations extended since the
                            Hungarian revolt. An invitation was issued through Protocol several days
                            later for a moving picture showing and dinner to a group of Rumanian
                            musicians. On a Sunday excursion on which I invited a Rumanian, whom I
                            have reason to believe reports conversations with me regularly to the
                            Government, I took pains to explain that unfortunately relations between
                            our two countries were so sensitive at the moment that any unpleasant
                            action by the Rumanians might have the result of seriously affecting any
                            pending business negotiations being carried on by the Minister in the
                            United States, as well as my own position here. I also dropped hints of
                            the same nature casually in passing with Rumanian officials with whom I
                            came in contact. Finally, on Monday, March 25th, the day following the
                            end of the Grand National Assembly, I called Mr. Frantescu and told him
                            that now the situation regarding my appointment with the Foreign
                            Minister had reached a stage where it was becoming a very serious
                            matter. I emphasized that if I had to report to my government that I as
                            a Minister was <pb n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0628"/>unable to see
                            the Foreign Minister I could not be at all sure that they would not come
                            to the conclusion that under these circumstances there was not much
                            point in the United States having a Minister in Bucharest. Mr. Frantescu
                            said he would convey this message to the Foreign Minister. About four
                            hours later I received word that the Foreign Minister would see me at
                            1800 on March 26th.</p>
                        <p>Later that day at the reception given by the Greek Ambassador on the
                            occasion of the Greek National Holiday, Mr. Frantescu confided to me
                            that my message had had immediate and most successful results. The
                            Foreign Minister upon receiving it had gone immediately to see the
                            Government (a phrase used by Rum officials to indicate the Politburo)
                            and had remained with them three hours even though he had had no prior
                            engagement with them. Upon his return, he had asked to have me advised
                            that the appointment was set for 1800 on the next day. I asked if the
                            “decision” had been made and whether it was favorable or
                                unfavorable<note n="5" xml:id="d243fn5">The words “favorable” and
                                “unfavorable” were underlined and the following appears in the
                                margin: “what’s with this favorable unfavorable stuff!”</note> and
                            he said he did not know.</p>
                        <p>At the same reception, I was greeted cordially by the Foreign Minister
                            who referred to our pending meeting and apologized for the delay, saying
                            that he had been very busy lately. I had a friendly non-political
                            conversation with him. I was also greeted in a friendly if somewhat less
                            cordial fashion than usual by Prime Minister Stoica who is customarily
                            somewhat embarrassingly effusive in his greetings.</p>
                        <p>The manner of these other Rumanian officials toward me at this reception
                            made it quite evident that a decision unfavorable to the United States
                            had not been taken at the morning meeting with the Foreign Minister. It
                            had either been deferred or else a decision had been made to take no
                            action whatsoever.</p>
                        <p>This was confirmed by the conference itself with the Foreign Minister. He
                            was most affable and friendly throughout and more receptive to the
                            proposals that I made than I have ever known him to be.</p>
                        <p>The conference took place at 7:30 P.M. on March 26th at the Foreign
                            Office with Mr. Gavril Gabor, the head of the United States desk in the
                            Rumanian Foreign Office acting as interpreter. I opened the discussion
                            by stating that between November 1955 and November 1956 I had worked
                            very hard to try and improve the relations between our two countries and
                            I felt that I had had some measure of success. I emphasized that
                            progress in improving relations because of past experience must
                            necessarily be very slow but at least we had been inching on. Then
                            suddenly a volcano erupted in the shape of the Hungarian situation. I
                            pointed out that it would be a complete waste of time for me to discuss
                            the events in Hungary with the Foreign Minister since I knew from
                            reading his speeches before the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> that
                            he and I were in <pb n="599" xml:id="pg_599" facs="0629"/>complete
                            disagreement in the interpretation of these events, and although I
                            subscribed to Mr. Voltaire’s views on the right of Mr. Preoteasa to have
                            his own opinion, a debate on the subject at this time would serve no
                            useful purpose. The important point, I believed, was to face
                            realistically the situation as it exists today and try to find areas of
                            agreement in which some kind of joint action that would tend to improve
                            relations would be possible. I had several suggestions to make to this
                            end.</p>
                        <p>I then referred to the refusal to the Rumanian Government to permit
                            American election observers to visit Rumania, although Rumanian
                            observers had gone to the United States.<note n="6" xml:id="d243fn6">On
                                January 19, Romania refused to allow three observers from the United
                                States to be present when national parliamentary elections took
                                place on February 3, despite an agreement under which Romanian
                                observers had come to the United States for the 1956 presidential
                                election. See Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>,
                                February 11, 1957, p. 213.</note> I said that, on a reciprocal
                            basis, it would seem appropriate that in exchange for the Rumanian
                            visits there should be a visit to Rumania of three American specialists
                            on education, political science, and chemical industrial matters. I also
                            brought up the question of student exchanges and finally I handed to Mr.
                            Preoteasa two copies of the publication, <hi rend="italic">Amerika</hi>,
                            pointing out that if it was possible for such a publication to be
                            distributed within the Soviet Union at a time when obviously our
                            relations with the USSR were not of the closest, it should also be
                            possible to do the same thing in Rumania.</p>
                        <p>I then said that there were several current pressing problems confronting
                            the Legation that needed to be solved and that although each one of them
                            in itself might seem insignificant, I considered their solution symbolic
                            of Rumanian sincerity and good will in trying to improve our relations
                            during this period. I said that first of all it had been agreed that
                            there should be no limitation on our having a reasonable number of
                            Legation employees in Bucharest and that I, personally, had gone to see
                            the head of the ODCD over six months ago on the question of obtaining
                            housing for new employees. I pointed out that three months ago we had
                            been assured that there were two apartments that would be ready about
                            the 15th of March, that they actually existed, and we even had gone so
                            far as to discuss whether or not our employees would assist in making
                            repairs. We had been assured this would not be necessary. Suddenly a few
                            weeks ago, we were advised without prior warning that not only were
                            these apartments not available but that it was doubtful if anything
                            would be ready until the end of the year. I stressed that it would be
                            impossible for me to retain Legation personnel indefinitely in a hotel
                            and that this sudden refusal was tantamount to an act deliberately
                            limiting the number of personnel the Legation could have. If this was
                            done it would mean, of course, that the United States Government in
                            Washington <pb n="600" xml:id="pg_600" facs="0630"/>would be compelled
                            to limit the personnel at the Rumanian Legation and we would then start
                            in the same old ridiculous process of retaliatory measures which I
                            deeply deplored.</p>
                        <p>I then briefly described the case of Mrs. Kohn,<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d243fn7">Documentation concerning Helene Clepcea Kohn is in

                            upbringing who has not received an exit visa and also the cases of
                            Vasile Charles Cionca, Maria Nanos and Georgeta Cotarla, as being cases
                            deserving of immediate action by reason of their humanitarian elements.
                            I mentioned the subject of tourism, pointing out that an American
                            citizen visiting Rumania had been told by militiamen that no tourist
                            visas would be issued this year to American citizen and said if this
                            were true, it should be reported to American tourist agencies.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I took up the question of the use of the United States Air Force
                            plane, emphasizing that I had been told by the Chief of Protocol that I
                            could use the plane in any way that I wished, that I had no desire to
                            interfere with the income of the transportation sections of the Rumanian
                            Government, but that the plane was most important for me and my staff in
                            view of the great distances involved when travel was necessary for
                            official or vacation purposes, particularly where children were
                            involved. I said that all I wished was to be told exactly what the
                            Rumanian position was on this subject. I pointed out that I would only
                            require the plane for three or four trips out of Rumania and return each
                            year and that once this permission had been granted by the Rumanian
                            Government last year, I could see no basis for withdrawing it since
                            certainly the privilege had not been abused.</p>
                        <p>I closed with a statement that even though US-Rumanian relations had been
                            going through a period of heavy weather I felt that there were plenty of
                            opportunities for finding things to do which would be of mutual benefit
                            and have at least a tendency to bring us back to where we had been last
                            year.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Gabor wrongly translated this last remark to indicate that I expected
                            US-Rumanian relations to enter into a period of heavy weather in the
                            future. The Prime Minister at once asked me in a rather startled manner
                            what specifically I meant by this remark. I pointed out the error in
                            translation and said that I referred to the current situation, not
                            something that would happen in the future. I said that I had read Mr.
                            Stoica’s speech and that I had been surprised to hear from him the same
                            ridiculous propaganda about the United States being imperialistic and
                            attempting to take over the whole world for the benefit of Wall Street
                            bankers which I had been reading lately in the newspapers. I pointed out
                            that I knew from my own personal contacts with the Rumanian people that
                            none of this was having any effect upon them <pb n="601" xml:id="pg_601"
                                facs="0631"/>since they all realized it was as ridiculous as I did,
                            but at least it would appear to indicate that at the moment the Rumanian
                            Government did not have very friendly feelings toward the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister started off by saying that he agreed that our
                            relations had slowly improved during the last year. He hoped I was of
                            course aware that this was a result of Rumanian efforts. They had tried
                            to show the United States Government the real desire of the Rumanians to
                            improve relations. Last fall this desire materialized in actual
                                discussions.<note n="8" xml:id="d243fn8">See <ref target="#d139"
                                    >Document 139</ref>.</note> The Minister said he would like to
                            recall that the Rumanians had hoped these discussions would be of a
                            concrete, substantive character but the United States had insisted that
                            they were nothing but preliminary talks. However, even this achieved
                            some useful purpose and at least it was good to know each other’s
                            intentions. The Rumanians wanted to discuss problems which, if relations
                            are to be normal, have to be solved by the two governments. One of them
                            was the problem of American claims and in this connection since the
                            claims are American it was hard for the Rumanians to understand why we
                            had not been prepared to present definite substantive amounts. The
                            American Government in its turn wished to raise other problems which the
                            Rumanians agreed to discuss.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the present Rumanian position he pointed out that I had
                            been able to listen to Mr. Stoica’s speech and he assumed that I had
                            noticed the part where he had declared the conviction of the Rumanian
                            Government that on the basis of principles of equality and mutual
                            respect, normal and reciprocal relations can develop between our two
                            countries. Mr. Preoteasa said that it was this thought that he wished to
                            be a guide in his answer to the proposals that I had suggested. He also
                            agreed that there was no point in discussing the period of last
                            November. He did not want to talk about the propaganda made against the
                            Rumanian Government which, of course, could not be accepted by the
                            Rumanian people. He laid these matters aside with the aim and the wish
                            that in order to improve relations we should try and find those things
                            upon which we could agree. He said that I had expressed a wish to
                            improve relations—the Rumanian Government had the same wish—let us now
                            see how this can be achieved.</p>
                        <p>He remarked that I had made certain proposals which I had referred to as
                            symbolic of our desire to improve relations. These proposals will be
                            studied. There are certain elements in them which the Foreign Minister
                            considers as being on good, solid ground. Referring to the visit of
                            United States specialists, he agreed thoroughly with the principles of
                            mutual visits. He recalled that Rumanian specialists in chemistry had
                            visited the United States and found it normal that correspondingly US
                            chemical specialists should come over here. He <pb n="602"
                                xml:id="pg_602" facs="0632"/>could not give me an answer on any
                            particular visit since this has to be studied by the Government, but he
                            agreed completely with the principle. Later on, other similar visits
                            should be developed.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister pointed out that last fall we stopped without any
                            conclusion concerning our discussion of all of these problems. At that
                            time the Rumanians had raised the question of solving United States
                            financial claims, together with the general problem of commercial
                            relations. The Rumanian Government sees in commercial relations an
                            efficient means to improve collaboration and advance relations in
                            general. Specifically, it was through commercial relations that they
                            hoped to find a way to pay for United States claims since Rumania has
                            not the money for such payments that is available to the United States.
                            Rumania is a country with a young economy in the process of development.
                            It is rich in resources and in order to improve the living standards of
                            the Rumanian population they have to pay a great deal for the
                            development of their national economy. It was, therefore, perfectly
                            normal that when they wanted to pay the United States the debts which
                            they owed them they should look for a way of doing so. Mr. Preoteasa
                            pointed out that the United States had never told the Rumanian
                            Government what we thought about this proposal and of whether it could
                            be solved in a commercial manner. He stressed that simply to explore the
                            question is not enough and that they were desirous of finding effective
                            means of definitely solving the problem. Perhaps if it could not be
                            solved immediately through commercial relations, it would be possible
                            for the United States to extend a long term loan to Rumania in order
                            that she could pay her debts. Since the United States has millions of
                            dollars to spend, why should not some of this money be used in this
                            manner? In the Foreign Minister’s opinion, we should re-examine certain
                            parts of the discussion during the autumn conference. It seemed absurd
                            if the United States had claims against Rumania that these claims should
                            not be discussed and an effective solution found to the problem of
                            paying them.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the publishing of a Rumanian magazine in America and an
                            American magazine in Rumania, the Rumanian Government wished the United
                            States people to know Rumania and its people as they are, the efforts of
                            the Rumanian people to gain a better life and a higher culture. The
                            opposite, of course, is equally valid, namely, that the Rumanian people
                            should know the American people, their life, their culture, their
                            achievements. For this purpose there exists various ways and means and
                            we wished to choose those which are based on mutual considerations. The
                            magazine which I propose is a very nice looking one made on good paper
                            with excellent printing and workmanship. The material in the magazine is
                            not controversial but deals with appropriate subjects. However, it
                            should be pointed out that everything that is valid between the United
                            States and the USSR <pb n="603" xml:id="pg_603" facs="0633"/>is not
                            equally valid between the United States and Rumania. Perhaps the USSR
                            has the means to make a magazine of this quality and distribute it
                            within the United States but the Foreign Minister was rather skeptical
                            on this point. In any event, the matter would be studied. Mr. Preoteasa
                            went on to mention that an exchange of exhibits should be seriously
                            considered and other forms of exchanging reciprocal information
                            concerning our countries. He noted in the magazine an article on an
                            American tenor. Why should the tenor not come himself instead of being
                            presented on paper in a magazine?</p>
                        <p>On the question of tourism, there is no reason this should not continue
                            to be developed provided there is a clear understanding between the
                            travel agencies of the two countries. The Foreign Minister pointed out
                            that Rumania was only in the beginning of its development of tourism.
                            Housing is a basis for tours and it is the one thing which Rumania
                            lacks. Its means are very restricted in this line. In this connection he
                            wanted to emphasize that there was no intention whatsoever on the part
                            of the Rumanian Government to limit Legation personnel by denying it
                            housing. The housing situation was a serious and difficult one in
                            Rumania but the Foreign Minister promised to look into this matter
                            immediately.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that in this answer he was giving me it was
                            necessary to realize that underlying it was the spirit in which the
                            Rumanian people looked on things and he hoped he had been sufficiently
                            clear in expressing it. What the Rumanian Government wanted was that on
                            the basis of certain principles of equality, respect for the Rumanian
                            way of life, Rumanian laws and respect for the American way of life, and
                            American laws, the Rumanian Government should improve and develop these
                            relations with the United States. He hope that these things should be
                            only a tiny part of the great work of the improvement of general
                            international relations throughout the world. Rumania is a much smaller
                            country than the United States but the Rumanian people are proud people
                            and love their country, its independence, and its development. The
                            problem is how to make the Rumanian people known in the world. They are
                            not always understood. The main wish of the Rumanian Government is that
                            Rumania should progress on the road of well-being and many sided
                            development.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister closed by saying that close attention will be given
                            to the various Legation problems I had brought up and he assured me that
                            the earliest possible answer to them would be forthcoming.</p>
                        <p>This is one of the few conferences I have ever had with the Foreign
                            Minister when at some point or another he did not raise strong objection
                            to United States actions. I received the very definite impression that
                            at least so far as he himself was concerned, he was most <pb n="604"
                                xml:id="pg_604" facs="0634"/>anxious to have things restored to the
                            same basis that they were before. It is obvious that the economic
                            situation is predominant in his mind and I have the feeling that
                            anything that we ask for or suggest will be examined by the Rumanian
                            Government to see if it cannot be turned into something which will
                            redound to their economic advantage. By the same token, I believe that
                            we should have them in mind in considering things that we may desire to
                            obtain from the Rumanian Government. It should not be difficult for us
                            to get them to agree to doing things for us in return for something
                            economically beneficial to them and their need is so great that we
                            should be able to get a great deal in return for very little if we so
                            desire.</p>
                        <p>What the “decision” contemplated by the Rumanian Government as related to
                            me by Mr. Frantescu was we shall probably never know. I am convinced
                            that it was not merely a device advanced by Mr. Frantescu to cover the
                            Foreign Minister’s failure to make an appointment with me. It is
                            interesting to speculate as to whether at the reported three hour
                            meeting between the Foreign Minister and the Government prior to the
                            fixing of a date for our meeting there was discussion concerning the
                            effect of unfavorable action against us on the prospects of future
                            economic dealings with the United States. It is always impossible to
                            assess accurately the effects of psychological warfare and in this case
                            whether the brief campaign carried on to try and forestall unfavorable
                            action had any influence on the situation is questionable in the
                            extreme. However, I continue to believe that United States interests and
                            objectives can best be advanced in Rumania by a tactful combination of
                            personal friendliness and very severe and firm official relations with
                            the Rumanian officials.</p>

                        <p>The Poles have requested aid approximating $300,000,000. Their requests,
                            covering cotton, fats, wheat, coal-mining machinery and certain other
                            items are set forth in Tab B.<note n="3" xml:id="d244fn3">None of the

                            appears at Tab C.</p>
                        <p>The Polish economic situation is serious. Poland is moving in the right
                            direction—toward internal economic freedom and away from its heavy
                            dependence on the Soviet Bloc. The Poles have stated that the U.S.S.R.
                            now pays the entire cost of its troop support in Poland.</p>
                        <p>There is relatively widespread press support for U.S. help to Poland (Tab
                            D).</p>
                        <p>You had earlier authorized aid offers of $25,000,000 ($15,000,000 under
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 and $10,000,000 under
                            Section 401 of the Mutual Security Act). It is the opinion of our
                            negotiators and of Embassy Warsaw, in which I concur, that the $25
                            million previously authorized will be inadequate to achieve the
                            political objectives which we seek. Embassy Warsaw feels, however, that
                            as much as $75,000,000 would <pb n="606" xml:id="pg_606" facs="0636"/>be
                            on the generous side and that less could be given (Tab E).<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d244fn4">These recommendations were incorporated in telegram
                                1333 from Warsaw, March 26, which concluded by emphasizing the
                                “desirability of ‘keeping our hand on the faucet’”. On the basis of
                                Poland’s record over the past decade, the Embassy believed that the
                                Polish request for $300 million and the possibility that a lesser
                                amount might be rejected was “almost beyond comprehension.”
                                (Telegram 1346 from Warsaw, March 27; Department of State, Central
                                Files, 748.5–<gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss>/3–2757)</note> My
                            judgment is that any amount lower than $50,000,000 in direct assistance
                            would be a severe disappointment to the Poles, would not help in
                            achieving our objectives and might well be considered money wasted.</p>
                        <p>Taking all views into consideration I would recommend a program of direct
                            assistance of $50–$65 million, of which $25,000,000 would come from
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 and $25–$30 million in
                            dollar loans from Section 401. In addition, we should attempt to
                            negotiate trilateral deals with Western Germany to finance surplus
                            agricultural commodities to Poland on the basis of a credit to Germany
                            by our Commodity Credit Corporation.<note n="5" xml:id="d244fn5">On

                                would need U.S. surplus grain to substitute for that shipped to
                                Poland. (Memorandum of conversation by Jacques J. Reinstein; <hi

                                Germany noted that if the U.S. Government agreed, “the forthcoming
                                American-Polish negotiations could be helpful in including the
                                Federal Republic in three-cornered trade arrangements or using her
                                as a transit country.” (Memorandum prepared in the Department of

                            might range from $10,000,000 to $30,000,000 depending on discussions
                            with Germany.</p>
                        <p>Tentative estimates of commodities which could be furnished under the
                            present $25 million authorization and under the proposed enlarged
                            authorization of $55 million are given in Tab F. Both authorizations
                            envisage mainly agricultural commodities for consumption, chiefly in
                            1957, plus some of the Polish requests for coal-mining and agricultural
                            machinery. The trilaterals through Germany would be mostly for cotton,
                            but possibly also a small amount of wheat to meet current deficits.</p>
                        <p>Information on Polish credit negotiations with other Western countries—so
                            far very modest—appears at Tab G. What we do will undoubtedly influence
                            future possibilities.</p>
                        <p>These recommendations have not yet been discussed with the other agencies

                            conversation that he wished to discuss the negotiations with the U.S. on
                            aid to Poland in order to impress on me the concern of the Poles.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he was extremely depressed and pessimistic over the
                            long delays and the relatively small amount which he understood the U.S.
                            negotiators were considering offering to Poland. The Ambassador stated
                            emphatically that he knew his government could not and would not accept
                            an offer of $30 to $50 million.<note n="2" xml:id="d245fn2">The

                            After commenting that the Poles were highly gratified over the reaction
                            in the American press and even in Congress to the desirability of aid to
                            Poland, he said that he was afraid the American side might not fully
                            understand the very great political implications of adequate U.S.
                            assistance. He hastened to add that he was not criticizing the State
                            Department but only taking into account the fact that the Polish
                            negotiators were technicians and refrained from emphasizing political

                            political point of view Ambassador Michalowski made the following

                                the political risk of accepting a small loan from the United States
                                without compensating economic advantages which such a loan would
                                lack. It would expose the regime to serious attacks from the
                                “conservative Communist” elements and the Soviets. It would also be
                                interpreted by the Polish population as an American rebuff or lack
                                of confidence.</item>

                                structural changes in the Polish economy to move away from the
                                old-style Stalinist regime. For example, sufficient wheat is
                                required in order to terminate the system of compulsory deliveries.
                                While there is enough bread in Poland, the margin of stocks is so
                                low that the end of compulsory delays might cause difficulties.
                                Sufficient stocks are needed by the state to meet any emergency and
                                at the same time permit a new system to take hold.</item>

                            <item>Of long-range significance is Poland’s need to end economic
                                dependency on the U.S.S.R. This cannot be done unless the U.S.
                                provides sufficient cotton, wheat, machinery and other materials to
                                replace Soviet goods. The Ambassador pointed out that Poland is now
                                totally dependent on the U.S.S.R. for cotton and iron ore, and also
                                needs wheat. Under such conditions the Soviets can apply economic
                                pressures to slow down and divert the Polish revolution. The Soviet
                                Government is using this leverage now. If the economic situation
                                further deteriorates, its pressure could bring about undesirable
                                political consequences in Poland.</item>

                            <item>As far as he could see, there is no other national leader at

                                fails or is forced out, there will be nothing but “Nihilism” and
                                disaster. <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> has to make

                                awhile until the situation straightens out. However, the Ambassador
                                emphasized that we should remember the people of Poland have given
                                    <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> only a “short term
                                credit” to improve their lot. The economic situation is the real
                                challenge. If <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> cannot
                                master this with suitable outside help, the alternatives might be
                                either the return of the Natolin group or another Hungary with its

                            <item>Protracted negotiations in Washington are now beginning to play
                                into the hands of the Natolin group. The Ambassador said that this
                                was to him the real danger in the situation and the reason for his
                                pessimism. He claimed that there were now indications that this
                                group is beginning to take advantage of the delays to spread the
                                idea the U.S. was much less reliable support for Poland than the
                                Soviet Union. According to the Ambassador, the Natolin group now has
                                the Soviet-Hungarian economic agreement to cite as purported proof
                                of Soviet generosity compared with American.<note n="3"

                            affairs or the aid negotiations, as he well knew, but that I thought
                            something might be worked out if his government would be patient and
                            understand the problems from our side, as I was sure American officials
                            were trying to understand theirs. I also emphasized to him the real
                            difficulties we have in our legislation and procedures in meeting a
                            considerably different situation than what we are used to in the aid
                            field, that is furnishing assistance to a Communist state formally
                            allied to the Soviet Union. He said he thought his people fully
                            understood these difficulties. However, he was concerned as to whether
                            the U.S. fully grasped all the implications of aid to Poland from the
                            Polish point of view. He said that he had the impression that State
                            Department officials were well informed and understood what was going on
                            in Poland, but wondered whether or not there was a general appreciation
                            in the U.S. Government of what the Polish Government is facing.<note

                        <p>1. Acceptance by Poland of a US offer of economic assistance on the order
                            of $80–90 million would probably have important political consequences
                            within Poland, with respect to Soviet policy toward Poland, and
                            potentially within the other European Satellites.</p>

                        <p>2. The Polish population, which is overwhelmingly anti-Communist, would
                            be encouraged to persist in the political attitudes which emerged openly
                            last summer and fall. US assistance would be taken as a tangible
                            evidence of American support for Polish efforts gradually to reduce
                            Soviet influence in Polish affairs. Assistance of $80–90 million<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d246fn2">The Polish press would almost certainly
                                report and discuss the volume of assistance in terms of its value at
                                world market prices. Any US attempt to evaluate it in higher prices
                                would therefore produce negative effects in Poland. [Footnote in the
                                source text.]</note> would disappoint original expectations of a
                            much higher amount, but this effect would be partially offset if the US
                            government indicated that the chances were good for further assistance
                            in subsequent years. Popular reaction would in any event be favorable to
                            the US and to the West in general, although this would be limited to
                            some extent if, as present plans envisage, about one third of the total
                            were channeled through the West Germans. The adverse effects of West
                            German involvement would be reduced if additional West European states
                            participated as well.</p>
                        <p>3. An assistance agreement would considerably strengthen <persName
                                corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName>’s position within Poland. To the
                            population, it would indicate his ability to deal effectively with the
                            West as well as the East and hold out some promise of the
                            reestablishment of fruitful relationships with the West. It would also
                            be taken as an indication that, contrary to the impression created by
                            some recent measures, <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName>
                            desires to preserve and expand the area of independent action which he
                            extorted from the USSR in October, and that he has a good chance of
                            success.</p>

                        <p>4. Within the Polish Communist Party, <persName corresp="#p_GW1"
                                >Gomulka</persName> would probably attract new support from both
                            dissident wings. While some Soviet-oriented Communists would regard
                            economic assistance from the US as confirmation of their fears
                            concerning <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName>’s innovations,
                            many orthodox party members who have heretofore remained aloof would
                            probably regard it as a gain for Poland and would therefore view
                                <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName>’s leadership more
                            approvingly. In the opposite wing of the party, which seeks more rapid
                            liberalization, extremists would remain dissatisfied, but many others
                            would applaud the agreement and increase their support for <persName
                                corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName>. Most important, <persName
                                corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> might gain the allegiance of a
                            large number of party rank and file who are apparently thus far
                            uncommitted to any group.</p>
                        <p>5. The size and composition of proposed US assistance would not produce
                            dramatic results in the Polish economy, but it would assist <persName
                                corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> in his attempts to raise living
                            standards and to liberalize Poland’s economic structure, particularly
                            its agricultural system. The US proposal includes fertilizer to increase
                            agricultural yields, fats and oils to enrich the feeding program for
                            animal production, and cotton and textile machinery which would directly
                            contribute to the improvement of consumer goods production. Grain
                            shipments, offered by the US, taken by themselves, would permit a
                            reduction of compulsory deliveries levied on the Polish peasants. The
                            proposed US shipments are not substitutes for deliveries which the USSR
                            is now making to Poland, nor is the USSR likely to increase its
                            shipments as a result of the denial of US aid. The US program would make
                            no direct contribution to the Soviet Bloc’s military capabilities.</p>
                        <p>6. In any case, acceptance of US assistance would not change <persName
                                corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName>’s basic Communist orientation.
                            He is at present concerned chiefly with the implementation of his
                            original program rather than its extension through further measures of
                            liberalization. US assistance would, however, improve his chances of
                            consolidating his recent gains.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The USSR</hi></p>
                        <p>7. The Soviet press has let it be known that the USSR regards the
                            prospect of US economic assistance to Poland with deep misgivings.
                            Nevertheless, it is quite unlikely that Polish acceptance of the US
                            proposal would precipitate a drastic Soviet counter-action. The
                            deterrents to such action have restrained the USSR in several instances
                            more provocative than the present one, and would almost certainly
                            continue to do so in this case. The Polish request for US assistance
                            indicates that <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> has
                            similarly estimated the Soviet reaction, and he may even have secured
                            the USSR’s permission in advance.</p>
                        <pb n="613" xml:id="pg_613" facs="0643"/>
                        <p>8. In addition to its capabilities for drastic action, the USSR can exert
                            great influence on Polish policy on a graduated basis, not only by
                            political means but also in the sphere of economic and military
                            relations. If an assistance agreement is signed with the US, the USSR
                            might stiffen its attitude toward Poland in these areas, although it
                            would be concerned that, with a basis for US-Polish cooperation already
                            laid, such a policy might rapidly strengthen this cooperation. The more
                            that US statements link American assistance with increasing Polish
                            independence from the USSR, the more likely are the Soviet leaders to
                            increase their pressure upon <persName corresp="#p_GW1"
                                >Gomulka</persName>. Statements of Polish leaders subsequent to
                            signing an assistance agreement would probably lay great stress on
                            friendship for the USSR in an attempt to reassure Moscow that Poland had
                            not been “bought” by the West and to forestall any increased Soviet
                                pressure.<note n="3" xml:id="d246fn3">An unsigned memorandum from

                                Soviet press. He also suggested that the memorandum overlooked
                                “Moscow’s willingness to adjust to a limited increase in
                                Polish-American economic ties” and “Moscow’s willingness to deal
                                more equitably with Poland employing the carrot as well as the
                                stick”. (Department of State, Poland Desk Files: Lot 61 D 77,

                        <p>9. Assistance to Poland in the proposed amount would probably encourage
                            many in the Satellite countries to hope for a day of greater
                            independence. Overtly, however, the popular manifestations of this would
                            be slight, and any immediate political consequences would be unlikely.
                            The results would be more substantial among the Satellite Communist
                            parties. Here the image of Western enmity, an important factor in
                            maintaining internal party unity and the sense of dependence upon the
                            USSR, would be blurred. Nationalist elements within these parties would
                            be encouraged to argue for a similar course in their own countries.
                            While their chances for influence are quite small in the present phase
                            of Soviet policy, over the long run their activities would probably
                            weaken party unity and thereby increase Soviet difficulties.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Consequences of Failure To Conclude an
                                Agreement</hi></p>
                        <p>10. Because the issue of American assistance to Poland has been raised
                            and negotiations have begun, failure to consummate an agreement would
                            probably have serious political consequences. Within Poland, popular
                            hopes for higher living standards and greater political independence
                            would suffer a setback, although they would probably not be destroyed.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName>’s prestige among the
                            population would <pb n="614" xml:id="pg_614" facs="0644"/>diminish, and
                            Soviet-oriented elements within the Polish Communist party would
                            probably gain a substantially greater voice than they now have.</p>
                        <p>11. The Soviet leaders would probably calculate that Poland was rendered
                            less able to resist Soviet pressure. With his bases of domestic support
                            weakened, <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> would probably
                            be forced into greater reliance upon the USSR and would be less able to
                            resist its demands than he is at present. While Poland would not
                            immediately resume the status of her Satellite neighbors, pressures to
                            move in this direction would increase significantly. Under these
                            circumstances, and with economic improvement held back by the absence of
                            Western assistance, the chances for popular disorders would be
                            increased.</p>
                        <p>12. Elsewhere in Eastern Europe, Satellite populations would tend to link
                            the failure of assistance negotiations with Western conduct in the
                            Hungarian crisis and to conclude that it was hopeless to expect concrete
                            Western help against their regimes. Nationalists in the Satellite
                            Communist parties would be discouraged about the prospects for eventual
                            greater independence from the USSR and would play a lesser role in party
                            affairs.</p>

                        <p>The economic discussions with Poland now hinge on whether the United

                            requests have been brought down to the lowest level of assistance which
                            would appear necessary to enable the Polish regime to move forward soon

                            determine whether the new regime will be able to tell the Polish

                            which they attached to their various commodity requests.</p>
                        <p>The Poles pointed out that if our offer were to stand unchanged, that
                            would mean that they could realize only some $38–$40 million in actual
                            commodities at export prices. Briefly, the reasons for this were that
                            (1) the Poles primarily because of political problems could not use the
                            $30 million of <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> triangulars through
                            West Germany and (2) the $25 million of <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                                >P.L.</gloss> 480 funds was worth only $15–$17 million if used for
                            wheat or cotton. These points are elaborated at Tab D. Also, transport
                            costs—several million dollars—would have to be deducted.</p>

                        <p>The Polish Delegation has put forward as a counterproposal substantially
                            the U.S. aid package (i.e. about $81 million) but <hi rend="italic">in

                            plus $10–$15 million for transportation costs. At the same time, they
                            agreed to our proposal to buy back, for dollars, such local <pb n="616"

                            to be made gradually. Thus, any <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480
                            deals with Poland would be substantially harder than those we have with
                            other countries.</p>
                        <p>The Polish counterproposal would furnish them 500,000 tons of wheat (half
                            of their proposed reserve), 50,000 tons of cotton (their 1957
                            consumption deficit plus half of their proposed cotton reserve), about
                            one-third of their requests for fats and oils to be used for current
                            consumption ($10,000,000), and a small amount of drilling equipment for
                            coal mines ($4,000,000 as against their original request of
                            $46,000,000).</p>
                        <p>The Poles state they could move forward on this basis provided that we
                            would state our willingness to consider further requests later in the
                            year. However, in the coming months they would try to obtain some <gloss

                            U.S. exporters and banks. To the extent that they succeed presumably
                            further requests from us would be reduced.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Canadian Objections</hi></p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, we have informed the Canadian government that the Poles have
                            made wheat an essential and urgent part of their revised request for
                            assistance. The Canadians object vigorously, claiming that any wheat
                            shipments by the U.S. to Poland on a concessional or long-term credit
                            basis will hurt future Canadian sales. Embassy Ottawa’s cables on this
                            are at Tab E. Canada has itself just sold Poland 450,000 tons on a
                            short-term (2–3 year) credit. We have asked Canada to join us in
                            extending long-term credits for a Polish wheat reserve but so far they
                            are unwilling. We have made it clear that our sole interest in the
                            Polish situation is political, not commercial. We have pointed out that
                            the wheat reserve is necessary if the compulsory farm delivery system is
                            to be abolished, and that this is of great political importance. At our
                            urging, the Poles have agreed to give assurances to Canada on future
                            purchases of Canadian wheat. Senator <persName corresp="#p_HGM1"
                                >Humphrey</persName> has let us know that there will be trouble if
                            we refuse to provide wheat to Poland because of Canadian pressure. A
                            further approach at a high level, as recommended by Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> in the telegram at Tab E,
                            should be made to the Canadians to impress upon them the necessity of
                            supplying wheat for the Polish reserve, and to ask them to consider
                            seriously whether they could not join with the U.S. in extending
                            long-term credits to the Polish government for this purpose.</p>

                        <p>I believe we should meet the new Polish request, which represents a
                            strong effort by the Polish delegation to come close to our offer. In
                            commodity terms their proposal is not too far away from the $80 million
                            which we offered and which has found substantial public support.
                            Although we would need some $92 million in <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                                >P.L.</gloss> 480 funds for the purpose, the actual <gloss

                            export values at $65 million in actual commodities at export prices and
                            $14 million in transportation necessary to move this volume, or a total
                            of $95 million. An illustrative table is at Tab F.</p>

                                54–23.<note n="10" xml:id="d247fn10">The vote was taken on April 1.
                                Section 304 reads: “The President shall exercise the authority
                                contained herein (1) to assist friendly nations to be independent of

                        <p>We could not meet the Polish request without using the new <gloss

                            we not delay our negotiations any longer. With the approval of the

                            USSR) might insist on similar assurances. Stated if US meant insist on

                        <p>After further discussion of this matter in the Department including
                            review by the Deputy Under Secretary for Political Affairs, we continue
                            to feel that in the light of our over-all foreign policy objectives in
                            Eastern Europe we should proceed with the expulsion. I would like to
                            call to your attention the following two considerations which we
                            consider of overriding importance: <list>
                                <label>(a)</label>
                                <item>The United States must maintain a posture of strength
                                    vis-à-vis the present Hungarian regime. The position of our
                                    Legation in Budapest is a delicate one. We have no minister
                                    there and do not intend to send one under present circumstances
                                    but we desire if possible to maintain relations. The over-all
                                    size of our staff in Budapest at the present time is three times
                                    as great as that of the Hungarian staff in Washington. Cardinal
                                    Mindszenty’s refugee status within the Legation is unusual.
                                    There is in these circumstances much to tempt the Hungarian
                                    regime to apply threats and pressures of various kinds. If we on
                                    one occasion display a willingness to back down before such a
                                    threat the temptation for Hungarian authorities to try again in
                                    perhaps an even more sensitive area would become still greater.
                                    In the present instance the consequences for us of refusing to
                                    give in to the Hungarian threat may be a decrease in our Service
                                    Attaché staff. But if we do not react firmly, the Hungarian
                                    authorities conceivably may miscalculate our policy and apply
                                    further pressure to which we could only react by breaking
                                    relations. This would result in the withdrawal of our <hi
                                        rend="italic">entire</hi> mission from Budapest. In short we
                                    cannot afford to allow the Hungarians to assume that we will
                                    give in to threats or pressure.</item>

                                <item>As you rightly imply, actions which we take affecting one
                                    country under Soviet domination have implications on our policy
                                    toward all the countries of the area. It is in general our
                                    intent to make it clear to the Communist governments of the area
                                    that if they arbitrarily declare a member of a US Mission
                                    persona non grata they must <hi rend="italic">expect</hi>
                                    similar action against one of their representatives. The object
                                    of this policy is of course to discourage Soviet and East
                                    European regimes from indulging in indiscriminate expulsions. I
                                    don’t need to emphasize that they could create very serious
                                    problems for us if they felt free to expel without fear of
                                    consequence our trained personnel who have spent many months in
                                    preparation for their assignment. (Captain <persName

                                    such a case.) Thus in the interest of our staffs throughout the
                                    area we simply cannot, in our opinion, let a case as blatant as
                                    the present one go unchallenged.</item>

                            <item>Following the establishment of the <persName corresp="#p_GW1"
                                    >Gomulka</persName> regime October 19–20, 1956, Poland has moved
                                in an evolutionary development in the direction of our objectives.
                                The <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> regime, which was
                                born in defiance of the Kremlin leadership, has achieved a relative
                                degree of independence from Soviet control notwithstanding Poland’s
                                continued membership in the Warsaw Pact. This relative independence
                                has been exemplified by decollectivization, cessation of jamming,
                                the church-state agreement, and the return to Moscow of Rokossovsky
                                and other Soviet military officials and intelligence advisers. It
                                has also been evidenced by a Polish desire to reestablish contacts
                                with the West. On the other hand, by remaining in the Warsaw Pact
                                and the Communist camp, and by restraining thus far the Polish
                                population from revolutionary uprisings, the <persName
                                    corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> regime has been able to
                                avoid the fate of Hungary. Bracketed as they are by Soviet military
                                power, the Poles have little prospect at present of achieving full
                                national independence. Nevertheless, the <persName corresp="#p_GW1"
                                    >Gomulka</persName> regime represents an important crucial step
                                in the desired direction, not only so far as Poland is concerned,
                                but also, in its potential effect, so far as the other satellite
                                countries and the Soviet Union itself are concerned. For the future,
                                the Polish example may be even more important in Eastern Europe than
                                the Tito example has been in the past.</item>

                            <item>The <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> regime is
                                engaged in a complicated balancing act. On the one hand, it has been
                                subject to unremitting pressure from the Natolin group and the
                                Soviet Union seeking to regain control; on the other hand, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> is being pressed by the
                                liberalizing forces inside and outside the Party to ameliorate
                                economic and political conditions in the direction of a freer
                                society. The Natolin group has some backing from the disaffected
                                Communist bureaucrats who may have lost their jobs or previous
                                privileges as a result of the <persName corresp="#p_GW1"
                                    >Gomulka</persName> regime, but it has no popular support. The
                                “liberalizing” elements—called “revisionists” by the Soviets and
                                they are revisionists in the classical sense—would like to move
                                rapidly towards a brand of social democracy unacceptable to the
                                USSR. The overwhelming majority of the Polish people are strongly
                                anti-Russian and particularly opposed to Marxism-Leninism and the
                                Soviet system. If the Natolin group were clearly to regain control
                                of the Party and government apparatus, it might well lead to a
                                popular uprising, followed in turn by Soviet armed intervention. If
                                the “revisionists” were to obtain control of the <pb n="624"
                                    xml:id="pg_624" facs="0654"/>Party and the Government, or if the
                                Polish people were to get out of hand, it may be expected that the
                                Soviets would move in with armed might. <persName corresp="#p_GW1"
                                    >Gomulka</persName> and his “centrist” group are the only force
                                in Poland capable of maintaining the delicate balance among these
                                other forces: The Natolin group, the “revisionists”, the people, and
                                the USSR.</item>

                            <item>The <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> regime is
                                leaning over backwards to avoid trouble with Moscow. However,
                                although it appears ready to go nearly all the way with the USSR in
                                foreign affairs, nevertheless it has not yielded on what it
                                undoubtedly regards as the decisive point—control of affairs inside
                                Poland and defense of Poland’s economic interests. Likewise, recent
                                concessions to the Natolin group, such as leaving Zenon Nowak as
                                Deputy Prime Minister, as well as recent indications that the most
                                outspoken proponents for liberalization are being curbed should not
                                be misinterpreted; they are necessary shifts in <persName

                                        control policy. If it appeared feasible, ACEP urged that

                                        U.S.-origin goods solely for its own domestic purposes and

                            Also that a Title I <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 agreement
                            totaling $65 million at market value would be signed and announced

                            Title I legislation, the agreement to include, among other things, funds
                            for about 400,000 M.T. of wheat and to provide that any portion of the

                        </list>
                        <p>I have discussed this subject with Cardinal Mindszenty several times,
                            always at his initiative, and have heard him talk to others as well. His
                            line of thought seems to be about as follows:</p>
                        <p>The West, and first and foremost the United States, failed Hungary, which
                            clearly was fighting the battle for the West, <hi rend="italic"
                                >during</hi> the revolution. The Cardinal seems to believe strongly
                            that had the United States successfully urged <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> action to bring in a small detachment of international
                            troops, or to bring in a high-level <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            representative early in the revolution, or had the United States
                            delivered an ultimatum of some kind to the Soviet Union, the latter
                            would not have intervened a second time. The Cardinal refuses to believe
                            that some action of this kind, whether it presented an ultimatum or not,
                            was not possible. He points to the activity of the United States in the
                            Suez crisis in October and has said plainly that he thinks the greater
                            activity in Suez than in Hungary has been because oil is involved.
                            “Unfortunately there is little oil involved in Hungary, only moral.”</p>
                        <p>The Cardinal has not argued as strongly for an ultimatum or a threat of
                            military action (during the revolution) as he has for a <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force or representation. He has accepted
                            the argument that the situation in the Suez differed from that in
                            Hungary, as far as <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops are
                            concerned, because Egypt accepted the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            forces. He does not accept the argument that the Hungarian situation is
                            different because Hungary <pb n="632" xml:id="pg_632" facs="0662"/>is
                            occupied by the Soviet Army. “Hungary is occupied because Roosevelt
                            agreed to it at Yalta.”<note n="2" xml:id="d252fn2">Reference is to the
                                Yalta Conference among Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin, February
                                4–11, 1945.</note></p>
                        <p>The Cardinal also believes that the West, and primarily the United
                            States, has failed in Hungary <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the
                            Revolution. Again he compares the situation in Hungary unfavorably with
                            that in the Middle East. “At least, there, there is activity, whether
                            there is success or not. Here there is only death.” He obviously has no
                            patience with the discussions in the United Nations since the revolution
                            and has referred bitterly at times to one news-item or another
                            (examples: a remark allegedly made by the Secretary in mid-March
                            concerning greater contacts with the Soviets; the withdrawal of Minister

                            as being evidence of unwillingness to seriously consider stronger steps
                            which he considers necessary.</p>
                        <p>To comments that we would welcome suggestions for peaceful means of
                            helping the situation in Hungary, however, the Cardinal has few to make.
                            His first suggestion and most frequently repeated is an economic boycott
                            (his opinion of Soviet economic and military strength is very low), but
                            he appears to accept some of the counterarguments. He has no other
                            concrete suggestions, however, except “activity,” and completely fails
                            to understand why there is so much continual diplomatic activity, a
                            Presidential doctrine, a high-level mission, continual discussion in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, over the Suez, and “nothing”
                            concerning Hungary. His bitterness on this point seems to be increasing
                            as time goes on.</p>

                        <p>The agreement should be treated in a matter-of-fact manner and its
                            significance under-emphasized rather than stressed. There should be no
                            suggestion of wooing the Poles away from the Soviet bloc or of aligning
                            them in a military sense on the side of the West. While we are anxious
                            that Poland evolve in the direction of independence from the U.S.S.R.,
                            this is for Poland a most delicate operation, given her contiguous
                            position, Soviet sensitivity to events at her borders, and the position
                            taken by the Poles who have described the negotiations as directed
                            toward “the normalization of economic relations between Poland and the
                            United States.”</p>
                        <p>Discourage public commentary from United States sources to the effect
                            that <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 sales will allow for
                            certain beneficial adjustments in the new Polish economic plan. It is
                            the chairman of the Polish Delegation who is expected to make clear how
                            Polish purchases of United States agricultural commodities will fit into
                            his country’s new economic program. This will avoid any implication that
                            the United States is dictating terms of Polish economic policy. Polish
                            statements may, of course, be used for credibility.</p>
                        <p>Consistent with the above, any discussion of the negotiations should not
                            refer to them as “foreign aid” which inevitably carries the implication
                            of a non-economic quid pro quo. Avoid reference to the fact that the
                            Export-Import Bank credit is derived from Mutual Security funds, about
                            which Poles are sensitive.</p>

                        <p>In coverage directed toward the U.S.S.R. the agreements should be handled
                            as items of straight news based on official documents. The fact that
                            these are agreements between two equals is implicit in the official
                            documents. While there should be no doubt that this is the fact, any
                            over-emphasis of it from official sources will run the danger of
                            “protesting too much.” No interpretative commentary should be used for
                            Soviet audiences.</p>

                            presented. Commentary should bring out the pertinent parts of the United

                            avoid the appearance of urging the satellites to seek greater
                            independence. Audiences should be allowed to draw the obvious
                            conclusions themselves. Reference may be made to President <persName

                            Nations General Assembly to investigate the events in Hungary of October
                            and November 1956, published its extensive report. The committee was
                            created by Resolution 1132 (XI); see <ref target="#d229">Document
                                229</ref>. Its members included representatives from Australia,

                        <p>The report concluded that the events in October and November 1956 were “a
                            spontaneous national uprising” due to longstanding grievances which
                            included the inferior status of Hungary to the Soviet Union and the
                            terror tactics of the Hungarian secret police. The thesis that the
                            uprising was “fomented by reactionary circles in Hungary” and encouraged
                            by “Western Imperialism” was rejected by the committee. Instead the
                            committee believed that the uprising was led and supported by students,
                            workers, and intellectuals, many of whom were Communists or former
                            Communists. The focus of the demands of the demonstrators, according to
                            the report, was democratic socialism. The committee also concluded that
                            the uprising was not planned in advance, but rather bore the “hallmark
                            of continuous improvisation.” The committee did find evidence that the
                            Soviet Union contemplated armed intervention in Hungary as early as
                            October 20, and it held that the firing upon demonstrators by the secret
                            police on October 23 and the intervention by Soviet tanks and combat
                            troops within a few hours did much to unite the opposition among
                            Hungarians. The committee was unable to determine if any invitation was
                            issued by the Hungarian Government for Soviet assistance in quelling the
                            uprising on October 24 or November 4. In the committee’s opinion the
                            uprising drew symbolic support from <persName>Imre Nagy</persName>,
                            although he did not instigate it nor was he its actual leader. During
                            the “few days of freedom” in Hungary, the committee believed that the
                            Hungarian people enjoyed political and human rights and began to assert
                            control over their nationalized industries. After November 4, the basic
                            human rights of the Hungarian people were violated by the <persName

                                    interest in the subject; the Secretary thought this would be no
                                    greater problem in September than in July since the real
                                    question is what action can we devise to keep the issue alive
                                    and before the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The Secretary
                                    suggested for study, as one possibility, having the General
                                    Assembly recommend to the Security Council suspension of
                                    Hungarian membership in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.
                                    Ambassador <persName>Richards</persName> noted that there would
                                    continue to be pressure from Congress to keep the matter alive.
                                    It was left that, at least at the sponsors’ meeting today, Mr.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> would play by

                                consultations with other delegations at a reasonably early date. In
                                addition to endorsing this report and calling upon the USSR and
                                Hungary to desist from repressive measures against the Hungarian

                            <item><p>As regards the question of the credentials of the Hungarian
                                    delegation at any reconvened session, we believe the position
                                    taken at the Eleventh General Assembly should be maintained.
                                    This would be without prejudice to action we might seek at the
                                    12th <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. The Assembly adopted the
                                    report of the Credentials Committee which neither approved nor
                                    rejected the credentials of the Hungarian delegation. This
                                    position should be maintained because: (a) a decision has
                                    already been taken by the Eleventh General Assembly on this
                                    question and a <pb n="644" xml:id="pg_644" facs="0674"/>motion
                                    to reconsider the Assembly’s action in this regard would require
                                    a two-thirds vote which would be very difficult to obtain; (b)
                                    an effort to reconsider and reject the credentials of the
                                    Hungarian delegation at any reconvened session would deflect

                                    the Eleventh General Assembly might have a favorable effect on
                                    some governments, and they may be more disposed to consider
                                    afresh and sympathetically the question of credentials in the

                                            >Document 263</ref>.</note> which will include the
                                    principal advantages and disadvantages of such action from the
                                    point of view of the interests of the United States.</p>
                                <p>It is our present view the most serious objection to the
                                    rejection of the Hungarian credentials is the implication which
                                    such action would have with respect to the status of the Western
                                    missions in Budapest, including, most importantly, the
                                    continuation of diplomatic relations with Hungary. We believe
                                    that, rather than challenging directly the legality of the
                                        <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> regime on the
                                    basis of the Special Committee’s comments and findings, it may
                                    be preferable to focus primary attention on the intervention of
                                    the Soviet Union which was solely responsible for the
                                    installation of the puppet <persName corresp="#p_KJ1"
                                        >Kadar</persName> regime against the clear will of the
                                    Hungarian people and to emphasize that the Soviet Union, upon
                                    whom the <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> regime is
                                    completely dependent for its existence, bears the onus of that
                                    regime’s unrepresentative character and its repressive
                                    policies.</p>
                                <p>It is questionable in view of the diplomatic implications of
                                    rejection of the Hungarian credentials that sufficient voting
                                    support for such action would be forthcoming. Moreover, the
                                    rejection of the Hungarian credentials could have an effect on
                                    our position on Chinese representation. On the basis of past
                                    practice, the report of the Credentials Committee has required
                                    only a simple majority for <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>
                                    approval. Should we maintain that only a simple majority of the
                                    Assembly were required to reject the Hungarian credentials, this
                                    would constitute a serious precedent as to the voting
                                    requirement for the rejection of the Chinese credentials. In
                                    order to protect ourselves on the question of Chinese
                                    representation, we would likely have to maintain that the
                                    rejection of Hungary’s credentials required a two-thirds vote.
                                    In these circumstances, it would give credence to the view
                                    already expressed by India at the last General Assembly that our
                                    moratorium motion on the Chinese representation question failed
                                    of adoption because the 47 votes it received was just short of
                                    two-thirds of those present and voting members.</p></item>

                        <p>56. At Belgian reception July 21 Politburo member Alexandru <persName
                                corresp="#p_MA1">Moghioros</persName> (also Vice President Council
                            of Ministers) sought me out, with Deputy Foreign Minister Lazareanu
                            acting as interpreter, to express his pleasure at progress US-Rumania
                            relations and asked me if I do not think things were going very well. I
                            replied in negative stating I had seen no indication on part officials
                            to grant any US requests in spite of fact US had consistently acquiesced
                            in everything Rumanians had sought. I said that co-existence could not
                            be one-way street, there must be some give as well as take, and that
                            Rumanian officials who always stressed reciprocity must practice what
                            they preach. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moghioros</persName> quickly
                            replied that reverse was true and Rumanians had given more than they had
                            received. He asked me what US had given to Rumanians. I listed (1) visit
                            Rumanian agricultural group in 1956 resulting in hybrid corn, modern US
                            agricultural machinery; (2) visit Rumanian chemists resulting in
                            successful purchase acrilon factory; (3) visit election observers; (4)
                            agreeing to establishment Economic Counselor; (5) offers of
                            opportunities for innumerable cultural exchanges. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MA1">Moghioros</persName> countered with statement that
                            everything Rumanians had received they had paid well for. I emphasized
                            payment was to individuals and asked him what requests of US Rumanians
                            had granted. After long <pb n="646" xml:id="pg_646" facs="0676"

                                >Moghioros</persName> lamely came up with permission for my use

                            normal courtesy afforded all diplomats all countries and personal
                            courtesies should not be considered in discussion reciprocity of
                            substantive requests by governments.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moghioros</persName> said US just as
                            interested in expanding commerce as Rumania and US had gained by
                            commercial transactions. I denied this pointing out foreign trade very
                            small part US commerce and US not interested in Rumanian products
                            although it was interested in assisting Rumanian people but I was

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moghioros</persName> said Rumanian people had
                            long history oppression starting with Greeks, Romans, Turks and were
                            exploited most under capitalistic businessmen and land-owners in early
                            part 20th century. In last ten years people finally set free and were
                            making extraordinary strides in development. I replied I was convinced
                            Rumanian people were being exploited today by Communists in far worse
                            fashion than they had ever been exploited before by foreign people or by
                            selfish industrialists and land-owners. <persName corresp="#p_MA1"

                            for building Socialist state. I suggested <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                                >Moghioros</persName> disguise himself and travel around country
                            with me in order hear what people really felt about regime. He said
                            disguise unnecessary but would take me to his own village where every
                            person knew him and they would tell me how they felt.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moghioros</persName> asked me what American
                            requests had been refused. I said opening of reading room, publication
                            of magazine and institution of program of information to Rumanians
                            concerning America was one of several such requests. He said he saw no
                            reason why these matters could not be negotiated and suggested they be
                            taken up in detail with Foreign Office. However, he said <gloss
                                target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> violent attacks against Rumania were
                            continuing. I countered that false accusations and lies contained in
                            press articles against America far worse than any broadcast ever could
                            be. He said there was reason for this (see separate telegram.<note n="2"

                            He realized that thing like radio was sponsored by small group powerful

                            power to do so. I said this was ridiculous fiction manufactured in
                            Communist propaganda mill and believed by nobody. I emphasized there was

                            question was typical of all Communist attitudes on co-existence, namely,
                            that co-existence consisted only in accepting all Communist proposals
                            and turning down all others. I said this pointed out fact real
                            difficulties between our two countries lay in difference between our
                            definition of co-existence and reciprocity and theirs. Until we agreed
                            on such definitions normal relationships would be difficult to attain.
                            To his emphasis on desire of Rumanian government for peace I said desire
                            for peace today no longer virtue about which one could boast. Since war
                            means self-destruction everyone desires peace.</p>

                            government should not make them overlook importance friendship with
                            small country like Rumania which sincerely desires good relations. I
                            said desire was reciprocated but good relations only possible if there
                            was real reciprocity.</p>
                        <p>This conversation reported in detail since I believe it indicates formal

                        <p>In brief, Legation (viewing problem from Budapest and not from world-wide
                            vantage point) sees little value in proposing a solution of Hungarian
                            problem which patently unacceptable to Soviets. Such course of action
                            could be of use only for internal domestic reasons in <pb n="649"
                                xml:id="pg_649" facs="0679"/>U.S. and Western European countries,
                            but could hardly contribute to solution and might even hinder it.
                            Furthermore, we doubt that they would receive wide popular support
                            outside U.S. and Western Europe.</p>

                                of State, Central Files, 764.00/4–1957)</note> or attempt to
                            reproduce Polish electoral system. Problem would be to avoid both
                            extremes of demanding too little and of making unacceptable demands.</p>
                        <p>Defense against charges that above suggestions constitute interference in
                            internal affairs would have to be prepared, but we do not believe this
                            would be difficult and mere existence of committee would be sufficient
                            to bring out such charges any event.</p>
                        <p>Question might be considered whether at this point committee should
                            propose some type Western declaration of intent vis-à-vis Hungary, i.e.,
                            disavowal of intention establish military bases or restore old
                            regime.</p>
                        <pb n="650" xml:id="pg_650" facs="0680"/>
                        <p>Under b above, for committee to make proposals along above lines would
                            probably somewhat increase already existing pressure on Soviets to take
                            such steps, but in our judgment would probably not bring this pressure
                            to point where satisfactory compliance would be very probable.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, unless additional incentive or pressure can be applied to
                            situation, and if best guess is Soviets intend continue repressive
                            policy here regardless, question is whether West gains more
                            propaganda-wise in Hungary and in world in general by demand for
                            complete Soviet capitulation in Hungary or by proposal along lines
                            suggested above. While this is not question for Legation properly to
                            judge, our feeling is latter choice preferable.<note n="4"

                                believed them to be constructive, but did not think they should be
                                considered in such “black and white” terms. The U.S. Government
                                should seriously consider retention of the Special Committee on

                                would have real possibilities for negotiated action. Even if the

                                recommendations, the political and propaganda impact of its refusal
                                would be considerable, particularly among neutral nations. The

                        <p>The United States has contributed substantially to alleviate the
                            situation of the Hungarian refugees who fled to Austria through the
                            provision of financial and material aid and through the admission of
                            over 34,000 of the refugees to this country. However, our program for
                            the Hungarian refugees who have sought asylum in Yugoslavia has been
                            operated on a very restricted basis and permits the parole into this
                            country of only about 300 of the refugees who are relatives in the first
                            degree of citizens and aliens already here.</p>
                        <p>It has become increasingly apparent that it would be in the political
                            interest of the United States to admit a considerably increased number
                            of the Hungarian refugees remaining in Yugoslavia. The approximately
                            9,000 refugees still in Yugoslavia are a particularly worthy group and
                            include a goodly proportion of active fighters against Communism and of
                            highly skilled, technical, and professional workers. It is important
                            that they should not remain longer as political and economic burdens for
                            Yugoslavia but rather should be given an opportunity to become
                            productive workers in the free world. By increasing the number we admit
                            into the United States, we would encourage other Western countries also
                            to accept greater numbers. Moreover, we would thus reduce at a crucial
                            time a cause of friction and misunderstanding between Yugoslavia and the
                            United States and illustrate again to the people of Hungary that the
                            United States maintains its interest in their plight.</p>

                        <p>It is therefore recommended that you authorize the Attorney General to
                            broaden the criteria being employed in the parole of refugees from
                            Yugoslavia to enable the United States to absorb up to 2,500 of them

                            <item>The unanimity of the Special Committee’s report and the character
                                of its findings and conclusions make it a telling documentary
                                record. It can effectively be exploited to refute Soviet and
                                Hungarian contentions regarding events in Hungary. To the extent
                                possible it is in the interest of the United States to make every
                                effort to enlist widespread support in the Assembly for the
                                Committee’s findings, preferably through endorsement in a specific
                                resolution. Adoption of such a resolution in the Assembly would
                                serve the dual purpose of placing the Assembly on record in support
                                of the Committee’s conclusions, thereby specifically rejecting the
                                Soviet version of events, and putting the weight of world opinion
                                behind the efforts last fall of the Hungarian people to achieve a
                                greater measure of national independence. The degree to which these
                                objectives can be achieved will depend upon the ability of the
                                United States and other key delegations to enlist such broad
                                support, particularly from the so-called uncommitted states in Asia.
                                In turn this factor may result in a somewhat less forthright
                                assertion of principle and purpose in the Assembly’s resolution than
                                would be the ideal, but our larger purpose is likely to be better
                                served by the degree of support for the Assembly’s action than by
                                specific provisions in a resolution.</item>

                            <item>Recent events in Hungary have included shocking examples of the
                                extent to which the <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName>
                                regime feels required to go to maintain control. While it is
                                unlikely that any action in the United Nations will ameliorate the
                                situation in Hungary, it is desirable for the Assembly to place
                                itself on record against the current campaign of repression. This
                                can be done in limited degree by inclusion in speeches of the United
                                States Representative and others of specific cases. Subject to
                                sentiment in the Assembly it may also be possible to cover this
                                aspect of the Hungarian situation by inclusion of appropriate
                                provisions in a resolution. Such efforts should remain coupled with
                                the use of diplomatic channels to bring such pressure as is feasible
                                upon the Hungarian authorities, and with other publicity designed to
                                focus attention on the situation. In view of the limited results
                                that can be obtained, however, this aspect of the Hungarian case
                                should not be permitted to deflect the Assembly’s attention from the
                                broader issues covered in the report of the Special
                                Committee.</item>

                            <item>The situation in the Assembly may develop in such a way that
                                questions will be raised regarding the possibility of further means

                                supplementary to those of the Special Committee. In general, any
                                attempted Communist rebuttal should be met with the same
                                observations made in the Special Committee’s report; namely, that
                                the United Nations would undoubtedly have profited by the data which
                                Hungary and the USSR could have submitted but that, in view of the
                                comprehensive and detailed documentation and testimony available,
                                such data would not have modified the Committee’s main conclusions
                                regarding what actually took place in Hungary, though it might
                                possibly have changed or elaborated certain specific points in its
                                report. Subject to circumstances, consideration could be given to
                                the transmission of any additional documentation to the Special
                                Committee. Primary emphasis, however, should remain upon the
                                continuing need to permit the United Nations and particularly its
                                Special Committee to have access to Hungary for purposes of direct
                                observation. Soviet and Hungarian rejection of such offers would
                                strengthen the propaganda case. At the same time care would be
                                required to ensure that such offers in no way compromised the
                                conclusions of the Special Committee or suggested that its
                                operations lacked objectivity.</item>

                            <item>In order to carry forward standing United States objectives and to
                                maintain such moral pressure as is available through the United
                                Nations on the Hungarian situation, the present Special Committee
                                should be continued on a standby basis available to serve the
                                Assembly at any time. Since the Committee’s existing terms of
                                reference may be generally regarded as limiting its efforts to
                                reporting and factfinding, it may be desirable to explore the
                                possibility of explicitly extending its terms of reference to
                                authorize it to undertake continued observation and examination of
                                all aspects of the Hungarian situation and to make recommendations

                                the better; if not, some propaganda advantage might be achieved

                            <item>A remaining problem involves the future status of Hungary in the
                                United Nations. It is desirable at the reconvened 11th session to
                                maintain the position taken by the General Assembly last March when
                                it decided to take no action on Hungarian credentials (thus refusing
                                either to reject or approve them).<note n="5" xml:id="d263fn5">On
                                    February 12, 1957, the Credentials Committee decided, at U.S.
                                    suggestion, to take no action regarding the credentials

                                    complained that such nonaction was a discriminatory procedure
                                    without precedent in the history of the United Nations. (<gloss

                                />would require a two-thirds majority which in all probability could
                                not be obtained and could deflect attention from the report.
                                Meantime, the present action serves to demonstrate that the Assembly
                                does not regard Hungary in the same light as all other Members of
                                the Organization. Whether more drastic action, such as outright
                                rejection of Hungarian credentials, should be sought at the 12th
                                session should be determined in the light of the situation then
                                prevailing. By extension, the argument could be applied to the
                                status of the Hungarian diplomatic mission in Washington, possibly
                                producing Hungarian retaliation. It may in the long run best serve
                                our objectives to maintain primary attention on the intervention of
                                the Soviet Union and its responsibility for the installation of the
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> regime against the
                                palpable will of the Hungarian people. An additional problem
                                involves creation of a possibly adverse precedent for the United

                        </list>
                        <p>In recent weeks the Hungarian regime has increased its propaganda
                            offensive against Cardinal Mindszenty and his continued presence in the
                            American Legation in Budapest. On August 20 the press spokesman of the
                            Hungarian Foreign Ministry reiterated a previous statement that the
                            Cardinal’s right of asylum in the American Legation is highly debatable
                            and in doing so went into considerable detail including the quotation of
                            a passage from the American Foreign Service Regulations pertaining to
                            the diplomatic right of asylum. Since then, the Hungarian press has
                            dwelt at length on the subject, and the Hungarian Deputy Foreign
                            Minister is known to have remarked to the British Minister in Budapest
                            that the American Legation was harboring a convicted criminal. In the
                            light of this mounting campaign, our Chargé d’Affaires in Budapest,
                            Garry Ackerson, is somewhat concerned over a number of potential
                            problems arising from the Cardinal’s status.</p>
                        <p>In an informal memorandum which Mr. Ackerson recently forwarded to the
                                Department<note n="2" xml:id="d265fn2">Undated draft memorandum by
                                Ackerson, entitled “Policy Regarding Cardinal Mindszenty,” attached
                                to official–informal letter from Ackerson to <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SJS1">Sutterlin</persName>, August 21, neither
                                printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.)</note> he points out that it
                            would be highly advantageous if we knew the Vatican’s wishes concerning
                            the Cardinal’s eventual departure from Hungary. It is conceivable, he
                            says, that a temporary easing of the situation might offer a brief
                            opportunity for the Cardinal to leave the country. Without any
                            instructions from Rome, however, he might hesitate to leave until the
                            opportunity had passed. Our Chargé likewise feels that the possibility
                            of a safe conduct from Hungarian and Soviet authorities may also become
                            more real at a future date, and he is of the view that some prior
                            preparation for such an eventuality would be wise. He suggests that the
                            Department might wish to consider the possibility of arranging for the
                            transmission of an “order” or “strong intimation” from the Vatican to
                            the Cardinal “so <pb n="658" xml:id="pg_658" facs="0688"/>that he would
                            be favorably inclined toward a request for ‘safe conduct’ in the event
                            that the time for making such a request should become opportune.”</p>
                        <p>You will recall that on April 26 you spoke with the Apostolic Delegate
                            here in Washington<note n="3" xml:id="d265fn3">A record of this meeting,
                                a memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> to

                            regarding Cardinal Mindszenty. The Apostolic Delegate promised to
                            communicate with you further on the subject as soon as he had received
                            the necessary information from Rome. He has not, however, as far as we
                            know, raised the matter again. Mr. Ackerson was confidentially informed
                            of the initiative which you had taken with the Apostolic Delegate and is
                            therefore aware that the Department has already endeavored to obtain the
                            views of the Vatican concerning the Cardinal’s eventual departure from
                            Hungary. Since, however, there has been no reply you may desire at a
                            convenient opportunity again to broach the subject with the Apostolic
                            Delegate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ackerson has also called attention to the problem we would face in
                            the event of a break in diplomatic relations between Hungary and the
                            United States. It is his view that the Cardinal’s care would presumably
                            pass to the Power assuming protection of American interests. Since the
                            time element might be important and limited, he believes that the
                            Department should make contingency plans now as to which Power would be
                            requested to assume these responsibilities. Certainly it is by no means
                            inconceivable that following our strong action in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in support of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> report, the Hungarian regime may be tempted to create a
                            situation where the further maintenance of relations will be impossible.
                            However, there are two questions which come immediately to mind if the
                            formation of contingency plans is to involve consultation with other
                            nations on this delicate problem. The first question is would it be in
                            our interest to pose the question of assuming the representation of our
                            interests in Hungary at a time when no crisis is apparent and when, as a
                            result, the country approached would have an opportunity to consider all
                            aspects of the situation—most notably the status of the Cardinal—and
                            could in good conscience give a negative or qualified reply on the
                            assumption that we had time to make other plans? If we delayed an
                            approach until such time as a rupture in relations were clearly imminent
                            or had been announced, the country which we approach would have to give
                            a quick decision which in view of longstanding tradition would probably
                            be positive notwithstanding the complications involved.</p>
                        <p>The second question is one of security. If at this point we made such an
                            approach to other representatives in Budapest, it is entirely possible
                            that it would cause wide-spread rumors that we are preparing to break
                            off relations. It is also possible that the Hungarian regime <pb n="659"
                                xml:id="pg_659" facs="0689"/>would gain an indication of what our
                            plan of action would be with reference to the Cardinal should relations
                            be broken. Moreover, should we approach a foreign government at this
                            point with specific reference to the Cardinal it is likely that that
                            government would insist on being told all of the background of the
                            Cardinal’s present status as well as our plans for the future. Here
                            again we might run the risk of compromising the security of our
                            strategy. If efforts were limited to a high level approach to the
                            British in London the security risk would probably be minimal. It would,
                            however, afford the British a convenient opportunity to turn us down. On
                            balance, therefore, we feel that it would be inadvisable to consult with
                            other governments on this matter at the present time. When and if we
                            reach the point of a break in relations we shall simply have to canvass
                            hurriedly the friendly Powers represented in Budapest and see if we can
                            persuade one of them to represent our interests including the
                            maintenance of the Cardinal’s refuge. If at that time no other country
                            is willing to accept this responsibility, we believe that the Chargé
                            d’Affaires should attempt to take the Cardinal out of Hungary with him,
                            assuming that the Cardinal is willing. It would be clearly understood,
                            however, that no resistance would be offered if Hungarian authorities
                            forcibly detained the Cardinal.</p>
                        <p>The final problem to which our Chargé calls attention is the situation
                            which would arise if the Cardinal should one day decide to give up his
                            refuge and walk out of the Legation. Mr. Ackerson says that he would
                            seek to obtain a written statement from the Cardinal that he was leaving
                            of his own free will and that his refuge had not been withdrawn by the
                            Legation. He then suggests that, following the Cardinal’s departure, he
                            would inform the Foreign Office that the Cardinal was no longer at the
                            Chancery. We feel that if circumstances permit, it would, indeed, be
                            worthwhile to obtain some kind of written statement from the Cardinal
                            prior to his departure though it is not believed that we need to insist
                            on one if this should prove embarrassing. We do not see any advantage,
                            however, to furnishing notification to the Hungarian regime of the
                            Cardinal’s departure, particularly since we never have officially
                            informed the regime that he has been granted refuge in the Legation.</p>

                        <p>On September 14, the Eleventh United Nations General Assembly adopted
                            Resolution 1133 by a vote of 60 to 10 (the Soviet bloc and Yugoslavia)
                            with 10 abstentions.</p>
                        <p>The text of the resolution had been under discussion for some time in the
                            Department of State. On August 30, Assistant Secretaries <persName

                            discussed a draft of the resolution. <persName corresp="#p_WFO1"
                                >Wilcox</persName> said there was “considerable sentiment among
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> missions that it is desirable to
                            have a resolution acceptable to the largest possible majority in the
                                <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>, even if the resolution must be
                            ‘watered down.’” <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> then
                            commented “that the present draft resolution was a ‘tough one.’ After
                            looking at last year’s resolutions on Hungary, he suggested the present
                            draft resolution is repetitious. His concern, he said, is that a vote on
                            the present resolution which is less than the votes on past resolutions
                            with imply that the Special Committee’s findings on Hungary do not meet
                            with general approval. The voting record on previous resolutions is
                            excellent, he said, and he does not want to damage the record now by
                            having a weaker vote on a nearly identical resolution.”</p>

                            stated that “He did not feel, however, that all human ingenuity had been
                            exhausted in putting forward new ideas for exploiting the Hungarian
                            issue to our advantage.” (Memorandum for the record by Toussaint (<gloss

                                    tough. The Sec said you have to use your judgment to tailor it
                                    to get the maximum position of making it tough and getting
                                    enough votes. L thinks we should get a fairly strong resolution
                                    and then after it is introduced we will have to see—may have to
                                    modify it to get 2/3s vote—L rather modify it then rather than

                            raising certain problems in connection with Cardinal Mindszenty has been
                            discussed thoroughly in <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss> and was the
                            basis of a memorandum which was sent from <gloss target="#t_EUR1"
                                >EUR</gloss> to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>, a
                            copy of which is enclosed.<note n="3" xml:id="d267fn3">Not enclosed, but
                                for text, see <ref target="#d265">Document 265</ref></note> Certain
                            action and decisions have resulted which I would like to relay to you in
                            this letter.</p>
                        <p>The first point which you raised was the desirability of learning from
                            the Vatican its views as to the Cardinal’s future. You will recall that
                            while you were here on consultation, we mentioned to you that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> had already broached
                            this question directly with the Apostolic Delegate here in Washington
                            but that no reply had been received. Quite by chance, almost immediately
                            after reading <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss>’s memorandum, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> saw the Apostolic
                            Delegate, who had been absent for some time in Rome. The subject of the
                            Cardinal was raised (whether by the Apostolic Delegate or Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>, I am not quite sure), and the
                            Apostolic Delegate indicated that the Vatican “prefers to let sleeping
                            dogs lie”. It is the practice of the Church, he said, to keep the
                            shepherd with the flock and the Vatican would not therefore call
                            Cardinal Mindszenty out of Hungary. The Vatican believes that we are
                            handling the whole question of the Cardinal well and has no suggestions
                            to make.<note n="4" xml:id="d267fn4">Ackerson wrote the following
                                marginal note at this point: “Easy for them to say! A”</note> It
                            thoroughly understands the restraint which we must place on the
                            Cardinal’s activities and would not wish it otherwise. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> gained the impression from the
                            Apostolic Delegate that the question of the Cardinal is not a “lively
                            topic of conversation” in the Vatican. In short, the Vatican is quite
                            content to leave the problem in our lap.</p>
                        <p>You will notice in the memorandum to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                                >Murphy</persName> that <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss>
                            recommended that no consultations be initiated with other powers at this
                            time on the eventual representation of American interests in
                                Hungary.<note n="5" xml:id="d267fn5">At this point Ackerson wrote
                                the following marginal notation: “I did not suggest
                                consultation—merely that Dept. give matter thought as this would be
                                an important factor if we had to ask some nation to take over our
                                interests here.”</note> The reasoning is given in detail in the
                            memorandum so I shall <pb n="664" xml:id="pg_664" facs="0694"/>not
                            elaborate here. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> agreed
                            with the recommendation and we shall therefore initiate no action until
                            there appears to be an immediate likelihood of a break in relations.</p>
                        <p>After reading the memorandum, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                                >Murphy</persName> commented that we should not request a written
                            statement from the Cardinal should he decide to walk out of the
                            Legation. This, he feels, would only disturb the Cardinal, who is a
                            temperamental old man. He concurs that if no other power is willing to
                            assume the responsibility of the Cardinal at the time of a rupture in
                            relations between Hungary and the United States, you should try to take
                            him along with you out of the country. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                                >Murphy</persName> feels, however, that the Cardinal almost
                            certainly would not desire to leave and that you should do nothing if he
                            refuses to go or if the Hungarians forcibly prevent his departure. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> concurred in <gloss
                                target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss>’s recommendation that no notification
                            need be given to the Hungarian regime should the Cardinal relinquish his
                            refuge.</p>
                        <p>Basically I am afraid this leaves all of your problems concerning the
                            Cardinal pretty much as they were. At least we now know, however, that
                            no positive action can be expected from the Vatican. It is our view here
                            in <gloss target="#t_EE1">EE</gloss> that it would be better to refrain
                            from indicating to the Cardinal in any way, for the present at least,
                            that he has been the subject of an exchange between the Department and
                            the Vatican.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>On Thursday, October 3, I was received by Deputy Foreign Minister
                            Lazareanu, with whom I had originally asked an appointment in connection
                            with the U.S. exhibit “Built in USA” (Legdes No. 170, October 9<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d268fn2">Not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.,
                                511.662/10–957)</note>). After a brief discussion on this matter,
                            during which he confirmed the agreement to open the exhibit on January
                            18, 1958, I told Mr. Lazareanu I would like to take this opportunity of
                            expressing my current personal views on the status of relations between
                            the United States and Rumania and that after the recent conferences I
                            had had in Washington<note n="3" xml:id="d268fn3">Thayer was in
                                Washington in September 1957.</note> I could say that I was also
                            reflecting the views of my Government.</p>
                        <p>I reviewed what had transpired during the last two years since I had come
                            to Bucharest emphasizing that during this period I had done everything
                            possible to recommend to my Government that favorable replies be made to
                            Rumanian requests in matters in which the Rumanian Government was
                            substantively interested, because I felt that the United States should
                            make a serious effort to indicate the sincerity of its desire to improve
                            relations between our two governments. These efforts had unfortunately
                            been interrupted by the events in Hungary, but as soon as the
                            international situation warranted it they had been resumed. I mentioned
                            the cooperation we had given in granting visas to Rumanian agricultural
                            experts desiring to go to the United States to transact business with
                            Mr. Garst and study American agricultural practices; the visit of
                            Rumanian chemists which had resulted in negotiations for the acrilon
                            plant and the favorable reply from the Department of Commerce for an
                            export license; the granting permission for the appointment of a high
                            ranking Rumanian officer in the Department of Trade as Economic
                            Counselor; and finally, the granting of visas to a trade delegation
                            composed of some of the highest <pb n="666" xml:id="pg_666" facs="0696"
                            />ranking officers in the economic field in the Rumanian Government to
                            visit America and examine any and all possible trade opportunities. All
                            of those things I stressed were matters in which the Rumanian Government
                            was deeply interested and in all of these matters I had urged my
                            Government to give favorable responses and they had done so. In return,
                            I asked, what had the American Government received? It is true that
                            relations and friends of myself and members of my Legation staff had
                            been granted visas to make visits to Rumania; that I had been given the
                            United States Air Force plane; and that the Rumanian Government had been
                            very courteous in affording myself and my staff from time to time
                            personal conveniences. But these it seemed to me were not matters of
                            substantive value but were simply courtesies which any government is
                            accustomed to offer every day to representatives of countries with whom
                            it has diplomatic relations irrespective of the political differences
                            which may exist between them. To the matters in which the United States
                            Government was substantively interested as keenly as was the Rumanian
                            Government in the question of trade, either definite negative replies or
                            no replies at all had been received, or else we had been told that these
                            questions must be settled only in the context of the settlement of all
                            the problems between our two countries. The record, I pointed out, thus
                            showed that although the United States Government had done everything in
                            its power to show a friendly attitude and a desire to improve relations,
                            the Rumanian Government only had given lip service without granting a
                            single substantive request we had made. We had asked for such simple
                            things as the opening of a reading room and the publication of a
                            magazine about America, two things which were freely granted in many
                            other Communist countries such as Poland and Yugoslavia and yet even
                            these had been turned down.</p>
                        <p>I finally said that under the circumstances it was logical for me to feel
                            that the Rumanian Government was not sincere in its expressions of
                            desire for an improvement of relations with the United States, and that
                            I saw no reason, unless the Rumanian Government was prepared to make a
                            gesture in the case of both or part of the two matters I mentioned, the
                            publication of the magazine and the opening of a reading room, why I
                            should continue to recommend to my Government that favorable replies be
                            made to requests from the Rumanian Government and that at the present
                            moment I was inclined not to make any such recommendations until after
                            some affirmative action was taken by the Rumanian Government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lazareanu at once launched into a long harangue with all the familiar
                            phrases about co-existence, non-interference in internal affairs, etc.
                            etc. He claimed that insofar as trade was concerned the United States
                            had no right to consider any of the things I had mentioned as the
                            granting of a substantive request since in all of these <pb n="667"
                                xml:id="pg_667" facs="0697"/>instances the United States benefited
                            from any trade arrangement that was made by the receipt of dollars in
                            return for goods. I interrupted to point out that trade was a question
                            of both export and import and that unfortunately Rumania did not produce
                            products which interested American consumers. Mr. Lazareanu went on to
                            say that the Rumanian Government had originally brought up the question
                            of claims but that we had insisted on adding other problems to the
                            discussions, that we had had these discussions but they had led nowhere.
                            He said that the Rumanian Government was still interested in settling
                            the question of claims and pointed out, as evidence of how important it
                            was for matters such as these to be settled first, that as soon as
                            Rumania and France had come to an agreement on how to settle claims they
                            had made great advances in other directions including negotiations to
                            open a library. I replied that the position of the United States on the
                            matter of claims was very clear, that the existing laws which had been
                            passed as a result of the failure of the Rumanians to reply to the U.S.
                            Government requests under the peace treaty prevented us from settling
                            individual claims at the present time, but that we were always ready to
                            discuss the question of lump settlement. I suggested that Mr. Lazareanu
                            review the record of the conferences that were held last October<note
                                n="4" xml:id="d268fn4">These meetings took place from October 15 to

                            the United States and that position had not changed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lazareanu went on to discuss the question of claims at great length
                            and it was apparent from this discussion that this is the one subject in
                            which the Rumanian Government is most interested at the present time and
                            which it will doubtless attempt to press to some conclusion at an early
                            date.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the discussion Mr. Lazareanu said he would be glad to
                            report to his Government my point of view in the matter. I said I hoped
                            we could get some specific reply on the question of the publication of
                            the magazine or the opening of the reading room and he said I would be
                            advised as soon as a reply was available.</p>
                        <p>From this conference and other snatches of conversations I have had with
                            Rumanian officials it is apparent to me that the Rumanian Government is
                            still anxious to have a formal agreement of some kind with the United
                            States as a matter of prestige. The Rumanian Government at the moment is
                            preoccupied in attempting to build up its stature in the world as an
                            active forceful country, taking a vigorous part in world affairs and
                            completely free and independent of any outside influence, particularly
                            that of the Soviet Union. Harrison Salisbury, of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >New York Times</hi>, has reported the naive attempt of Rumanian
                            officials to present all phases of Rumanian life as being free <pb
                                n="668" xml:id="pg_668" facs="0698"/>of Soviet influence or
                            direction. (Legtel No. 152 of September 9, 1957.<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d268fn5">Not printed. (Department of State, Central Files,
                                766.13/9–3057)</note> ) An agreement with the United States would go
                            far to helping put over this idea. The facts in my opinion are of course
                            directly opposite. I believe that the Soviets exert a far greater
                            control and direction on Rumanian affairs than appears on the surface. I
                            see no reason why the United States should assist the Rumanians in
                            achieving their objective of presenting this false facade by dignifying
                            them with a firm agreement on a question such as claims, unless such an
                            agreement would bring a substantive advantage to U.S. citizens, the
                            owners of such claims, and this I very much doubt would be the case. In
                            any event, I do not believe that any negotiations should be started
                            until the Rumanians have shown their good faith by granting some
                            substantive requests such as the publication of a magazine or the
                            opening of a reading room.</p>

                                    the working class had not come out into the streets to support
                                    the students. Moreover, the Cardinal had exercised a restraining

                        </list>
                        <p>The Legation is of the opinion that now would be an appropriate time for
                            certain aspects of current United States policy toward Hungary to be
                            reviewed by the Department. Since last November, the United States has
                            consistently followed a policy of strong condemnation of the present
                            Hungarian Government and of minimum cultural and other contacts with it.
                            Although the Legation believes that this policy has been correct and
                            that no course substantially different would have been advisable or
                            possible during this period, we are beginning to be concerned lest a
                            continuation of this attitude <hi rend="italic">in all of its
                                aspects</hi> for too long might prove to be counterproductive.</p>
                        <p>In particular the Legation believes that it would be appropriate at the
                            present time to review the question of cultural relations between the
                            United States and Hungary and the question of the travel of American
                            citizens to Hungary. Separate despatches, No. 218 and No. 219, covering
                            these two subjects in greater detail, are being transmitted by this
                            pouch.</p>
                        <p>Our attitude toward these two problems stems from the belief that a new
                            phase has begun in the life of the post-revolutionary government of
                            Hungary. This period may in one sense have begun in the late spring when
                            the major problems of physical control were largely settled or in
                            another sense the new period may begin after the anniversary of the
                            October uprising. But in any case the physical consolidation of the new
                            government is now largely accomplished, and a new phase has begun or is
                            about to begin in which it would seem that the regime must attempt to

                            demand somewhat different policies on the part of the West than during
                            the initial post-revolutionary period.</p>
                        <p>At the same time the problem of relations between the Hungarian
                            Government and the Western powers may also be thought of as entering a
                            new phase after the United Nations discussion on Hungary in September.
                            While it is true that United Nations interest in Hungary may well
                            continue, it also seems likely that any future action of that body will
                            be more along the line of persuasive tactics, as represented by the
                            apparent tactics of Prince Wan,<note n="4" xml:id="d270fn4">Prince Wan
                                Waithaiakon was the Special Representative of the General Assembly
                                on the Hungarian Problem. He was pursuing the following objectives:
                                1) humanitarian treatment of dissidents in Hungary, 2) return of
                                deportees from the Soviet Union, 3) withdrawal of Soviet troops from
                                Hungary, and 4) free elections in Hungary. As of October 10, Prince
                                Wan had contacted the Governments of the Soviet Union and Hungary
                                and appealed for humanitarian treatment and return of deportees, but
                                without success. (<hi rend="italic">Yearbook of the United

                            to the condemnatory tactics of the first few months after the
                            revolution. This does not imply by any means that Western governments
                            should now accept the Hungarian regime as legal and based on popular
                            support, but it does suggest that governments should re-examine their
                            attitudes toward the regime to see if they will stand the test of
                            time.</p>
                        <p>In so far as cultural contacts are concerned, it is a fact that United
                            States cultural contacts with Hungary are now considerably less than
                            those with the USSR; a continuation of this situation in the future
                            would seem to be increasingly undesirable.</p>
                        <p>With this background, it seems less appropriate for the United States to
                            continue policies which, although aimed primarily at the Hungarian
                            Government, do have as one effect the isolation of the Hungarian people
                            from contacts. It is obvious from past experience in the question of
                            contacts that the Hungarian thirst for knowledge of, and all types of
                            association with, Western culture is great and continuing. This
                            situation has not been altered by the national uprising.</p>
                        <p>There remain, of course, serious problems of the nature and extent of any
                            moves in the cultural field which the United States might make, as well
                            as their timing, publicity treatment, and the question of some quid pro
                            quo. These very important matters are discussed in more detail in the
                            reference despatches. Despite the necessity of examining these as
                            separate problems, however, the Legation considers that from the
                            political point of view the pressures which argue for some change in
                            present policy are similar and apply to both areas.</p>
                        <p>The Legation recommends therefore that these political aspects be kept in
                            mind in Departmental consideration of the more technical aspects of each
                            problem.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary greeted the visitors and mentioned his personal ties with
                            Poland, in particular his work in Warsaw in 1926 and connection with the
                            stabilization of the zloty and his work as counsel for the Polish
                            Government in a suit involving the return of Polish gold stored with the
                            French and looted by the Germans.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rapacki expressed his satisfaction with the present visit, which was
                            his first to the United States. He said that, at the time of the
                            Secretary’s visit to Poland, he was far from being active, at least in
                            public life, but that it was probable that the Secretary had met his
                            father, a Governor of the Bank of Poland.</p>
                        <pb n="672" xml:id="pg_672" facs="0702"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he had indubitably met the Minister’s father.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed his happiness at the recent resumption of closer
                            relationship between the two countries. He assured the Minister that the
                            United States does not aim at impairing close and friendly relations
                            between Poland and the Soviet Union nor at following a cordon sanitaire
                            policy similar to that of France after the First World War. The
                            Secretary had repeatedly assured various Soviet leaders that it was the
                            hope of the United States that friendly relations would prevail between
                            the Soviet Union and neighboring governments. The Secretary expressed,
                            however, the opinion that genuine friendship must derive from the
                            expression of their independent will. He feared that Poland and Hungary,
                            which have a long tradition of independence, would not be able to be
                            friendly towards the Soviet Union unless given full independence. A
                            situation dangerous to Poland, to the Soviet Union and to world peace
                            would result if their full independence were not recognized. The United
                            States has no objection to any form of social organization in any
                            country. It is hoped that there would be an evolution within Eastern
                            Europe towards greater independence. Such an evolution, however, should
                            take place within a general framework of friendship between the Soviet
                            Union and the countries concerned.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rapacki expressed his agreement with ideas put forward by the
                            Secretary. It is a fact that the relations between Poland and other
                            countries, socialist as well as other, have improved. The further
                            improvement of such relations is a basis of Polish policy. There is no
                            contradiction between Poland’s friendship with her neighbor to the east
                            or with socialist countries in general and Poland’s friendship with
                            other countries. It is of great importance to Poland that the United
                            States understands this.</p>
                        <p>The situations of Poland and of Hungary are quite dissimilar. Events such
                            as those in Hungary are impossible in Poland because in Poland measures
                            were taken in time in order to bring together the people and the
                            Government. The intention of the Polish Government to continue to do all
                            it can in this direction guarantees this. Mr. Rapacki joined the
                            Secretary in the expression of opinion that friendship must be based on
                            freedom and equality.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rapacki expressed his satisfaction with the improvement in the
                            relations between the United States and Poland in the economic as well
                            as the political fields. He expressed the hope that the present meeting
                            would be a contribution to the satisfactory development of such
                            relations.</p>
                        <pb n="673" xml:id="pg_673" facs="0703"/>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that in order to move toward closer economic
                            cooperation, he had had to make a finding that Poland was independent
                            from the Soviet Union. It was not easy for him to take this decision. He
                            hoped that events would prove him right.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary further stated that he was disturbed by the change in the
                            Polish attitude towards the Hungarian question in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He expressed the hope that this change
                            does not mean that the Polish Government has lost the measure of
                            independence shown earlier.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rapacki stated that the experience of mutual relationship is the best
                            way to find out whether or not Poland is independent. In regard to the
                            Hungarian question, he stated that the Polish position was not
                            influenced by any external pressures and that, in fact, the position of
                            Poland in regard to this position has not changed. There may be
                            differences of opinion as to the causes of the events in Hungary. There
                            may be such differences of opinion between Poland and the United States
                            on the one hand, and Poland and Czechoslovakia or the Soviet Union on
                            the other hand.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed his surprise at the statement that the Polish
                            attitude in respect to the Hungarian question had not changed, since
                            last November Poland abstained on resolutions dealing with Hungary
                            whereas this time Poland had voted against the Hungarian resolution,
                            thus siding with the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rapacki stated that Poland had long-standing reservations concerning
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action in regard to Hungary. It is
                            the opinion of the Polish Government that, irrespective of the causes of
                            the events in Hungary, the further presence of the Hungarian question on
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> agenda can only further complicate
                            the international situation. This was the opinion of the Polish
                            Government last year and it continues to be so now.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that it was, nevertheless, a fact that Poland voted
                            differently now than it did a year ago.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rapacki stated that a vote does not necessarily represent the entire
                            position of a country and should not be construed as a sign of
                            dependency.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rapacki further stated that a clear understanding of the Polish
                            foreign policy could be obtained only by appreciating the enormous
                            importance for Poland of a general détente in the overall international
                            situation. The economic situation of Poland depends on the international
                            situation. At the present moment Poland is reorganizing her economy in
                            such a way as to make possible a greater degree of individual
                            initiative. The success of this reorganization depends on an
                            international détente and on closer economic, technical and cultural
                            relations with the United States. This shows what Poland’s interests are
                            in international affairs.</p>
                        <pb n="674" xml:id="pg_674" facs="0704"/>
                        <p>Speaking of disarmament, Mr. Rapacki stated that Poland viewed this
                            question from the point of view of the danger of German rearmament.
                            German rearmament would create not only an immediate and direct danger
                            but also an indirect danger, a political threat arising from
                            encouragement which rearmament would give to revisionist tendencies in
                            Germany. Poland is not overestimating the importance of such tendencies
                            today, as it realizes that the major part of German public opinion is in
                            favor of good relations with Poland. Nevertheless German rearmament and
                            the lack of clarity in respect to the position of many countries in
                            regard to the question of the Polish-German borders may create an
                            incentive for a political revival of militarism and revisionism. Mr.
                            Rapacki had recently had his first talk with a German diplomat, the late
                            Ambassador Pfleiderer. From this conversation Mr. Rapacki gained the
                            understanding that no serious German politician thinks of a change in
                            the Polish-German borders but that the German government’s attitude is
                            influenced by the stand of refugees from Polish western territories. Mr.
                            Rapacki’s own opinion is that stating the truth would be better, as it
                            would prevent the fostering of dangerous illusions by the Germans.</p>
                        <p>Another preoccupation of the Polish government is the banning of atomic
                            weapons. Here again the question concerns nuclear weapons in German
                            hands. This would create a new situation for Poland and might force even
                            a change in Polish economic plans and hopes. This, in turn, would result
                            in a hardening of East-West differences. In consequence, Poland had made
                            a proposal for the elimination of nuclear weapons from Polish, East
                            German and West German territories.<note n="3" xml:id="d271fn3">During
                                the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> General Assembly debate on
                                disarmament on October 2, Foreign Minister Rapacki announced that,
                                after consultation with other Warsaw Pact members, Poland was
                                willing to accept prohibition of production and stockpiling of
                                nuclear weapons on its territory provided West and East Germany
                                simultaneously took the same action. (<gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                    >U.N.</gloss> doc. A/PV.697) This proposal came to be known as
                                the Rapacki Plan.</note> In order to make that proposal, Poland
                            needed an understanding with the other countries of the Warsaw pact and,
                            in particular, with Czechoslovakia. This understanding had been reached.
                            Mr. Rapacki was sure that West German public opinion would favor the
                            Polish proposal. It would also be a first step towards full
                            disarmament.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rapacki emphasized that the German question is the central
                            preoccupation of Polish foreign policy. The situation in respect to
                            Germany is the criterion by which the average Polish citizen judges
                            foreign policy in general. Thus, the danger of German remilitarization
                            is the most important mortgage weighing on the relations between Poland
                            and the West.</p>
                        <pb n="675" xml:id="pg_675" facs="0705"/>
                        <p>It is not, of course, the only question which remains. There are also
                            some remaining traces of the cold war but they should be easier to
                            settle. For instance, the Polish government is disturbed by Radio Free
                            Europe broadcasts in Polish, which deal exclusively with questions of
                            Polish internal politics.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rapacki stated that the Polish government would see nothing wrong
                            with broadcasting of propaganda dealing with the achievements of the
                            United States and defending American policies. He said that Poland
                            stopped all jamming a year ago, including jamming of Radio Free
                            Europe.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that he would check into the facts concerning <gloss
                                target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>’s broadcasts.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rapacki repeated that he is in favor of an exchange of ideas but
                            against a radio station broadcasting opinions on Polish internal affairs
                            in the Polish language.</p>
                        <p>He further stated that he did not wish to give the impression that the
                            Polish attitude towards Germany is nationalistic. Polish public opinion
                            has evolved and the majority of Poles understand that Poland can and
                            should be friendly with Germany. That is why already two years ago the
                            Polish government stated its willingness to normalize relations between
                            the two countries. Although there have been some gestures and
                            declarations by Germany, no practical steps were taken by it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rapacki said that the Poles understand the necessity of German
                            reunification but, of course, they would not outdo <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> on this matter. The time is not
                            ripe for a purely mechanical solution which could only lead to an
                            explosion fatal to both Germany and Europe in general. Only a general
                            détente can make German reunification possible.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rapacki expressed his satisfaction with the economic agreement
                            concluded earlier between the United States and Poland<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d271fn4">Regarding the Agreement signed on June 7, see <ref
                                    target="#d253">Document 253</ref>.</note> —not so much because
                            of the sum involved, as because of the fact of the agreement itself. The
                            assistance obtained from the United States had helped Poland in a
                            transitional situation. Poland is changing her methods of economic
                            administration. It is moving towards greater democracy. Such changes
                            are, however, easier to propound than to implement. One thing that has
                            been done is the conversion of a large part of the metal industry to
                            production of consumer goods. In regard to economic cooperation between
                            the United States and Poland, Mr. Rapacki said the Poles approached this
                            from the long-run standpoint of their central interest in reserves and
                            investments. Reserves would make possible liberalization in agriculture,
                            with a suppression of compulsory deliveries. They would also make it
                            possible to have more <pb n="676" xml:id="pg_676" facs="0706"
                            />liberalization in industry, greater freedom given workers councils,
                            greater emphasis made on consumer’s goods, and more development of small
                            handicraft enterprises. Reserve stores are needed for the changes in
                            agriculture and industry, and tools and equipment are needed for the
                            handicraft industries. The second major aim is to obtain investments for
                            the consumer goods industries. This is an urgent task since the Polish
                            population is growing at a rate second only to that of China. Poland
                            must develop foreign sources of investment capital. Otherwise, the
                            investments have to be carried out at the expense of the standard of
                            living. This would have disastrous political consequences. Poland would
                            like to talk about long-term economic prospects. It would like to
                            discuss possibilities for creating conditions favorable for an increase
                            of private investment in Poland. It would like our support for Polish
                            membership in the International Bank.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rapacki further stated that it was useless to talk of loans without
                            talking about an increase in trade itself. In that respect Poland is
                            handicapped by the lack of most-favored-nation treatment by the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rapacki expressed his satisfaction with cultural exchanges and
                            technical assistance. He mentioned agreements with the Ford and
                                <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName> Foundations, CARE
                            and the Joint Distribution Committee. Talks are taking place with other
                            organizations.</p>
                        <p>To sum up, Mr. Rapacki stated that both nations have clearly the same
                            aims in international relations although their methods may differ. What
                            Poland is seeking most of all is a feeling of security.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary thanked Mr. Rapacki for his remarks. He observed that it is
                            not possible to settle all of these questions right here at this
                            meeting. The economic talks will be pursued with Mr. <persName

                                through established diplomatic channels and expressed hope that they
                                would be concluded quickly. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                    >Dillon</persName> replied that the progress of talks would
                                depend on the U.S. Congress and the stability of the present

                                    <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> agreed that
                                discussions would begin on October 31 and cover a broad range of
                                economic matters including Poland’s acquisition of American
                                agricultural commodities, the role of U.S. industry in Poland’s
                                economy, the problem of legislative restrictions on U.S. exports to
                                Poland, and the extension to Poland of most-favored-nation
                                treatment. (Memorandum of conversation by <persName

                            Secretary stated that the German situation was indeed of the highest
                            importance. We recognize Polish concern about this after Poland’s
                            experiences in two world wars. We also remembered these wars. A failure
                            to obtain German reunification is bound to create very serious threats
                            to peace. Even if it is not <pb n="677" xml:id="pg_677" facs="0707"
                            />expected that these dangers may materialize within one or two years,
                            they will certainly materialize within the next 20 years. It is
                            impossible to keep divided a people as powerful and numerous as the
                            Germans.</p>
                        <p>A second aspect of the question is how to control German rearmament. The
                            close relationship which exists between the United States and the German
                            Federal Republic should not lead one to believe that the United States
                            is not aware of the importance of this question.</p>
                        <p>There are different theories as to the manner in which German
                            remilitarization can be prevented. The Secretary himself participated in
                            the work on the peace treaty at Versailles. Although the provisions of
                            this treaty were worked out with great care by Marshal Foch and others,
                            the experience of history has shown that this method failed because 20
                            years later nobody wanted to risk war to enforce the provisions of the
                            treaty.</p>
                        <p>The only way of controlling Germany is by making it a living part of a
                            whole dominated by peaceful elements. This is the basic principle of the
                            Brussels Treaty on European unity and the North Atlantic Treaty
                            Organization. They seek not to deny German rearmament but to place
                            limits on it and to integrate German forces with others so as to render
                            them ineffective when acting by themselves. We understand that this
                            method is not favored by the Soviet leaders nor possibly by Foreign
                            Minister Rapacki himself. Nevertheless, it is based on a sound
                            historical experience and is bound to prove preferable in the long run.
                            Thus, the aims of Poland and the United States are the same although
                            their methods may differ.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rapacki expressed the view that it might not be too bad for Poland if
                            German troops were controlled by France, but it would be disastrous if
                            French troops were controlled by Germans.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that this might have been the case if France alone
                            were concerned. In fact, however, the United Kingdom and the United
                            States are also involved. He remarked that the Soviet Union asks for a
                            withdrawal of American troops from Germany. The presence of American
                            troops in Germany is the best guarantee of peace for Poland. The Poles
                            should pray that these troops remain where they are.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rapacki stated that Poland would prefer to see the German army
                            reduced to an internal police force.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that this would be a return to the situation which
                            prevailed after Versailles.</p>

                        <p>The President called the Secretary of State regarding proposed statement
                            to be issued in his name on October 23rd, the anniversary of the
                            Hungarian revolt of last year.<note n="2" xml:id="d272fn2"><p>The
                                    statement as released on October 23 reads:</p>
                                <p>“A year ago today the Hungarian people attempted to establish a
                                    free government of their own choice. Their attempt was
                                    ruthlessly and brutally crushed by the armed forces of their
                                    Communist oppressors.</p>
                                <p>“All Americans as well as free people the world over will
                                    remember this historic event not only with sorrow for the
                                    sacrifices of the Hungarian people but with feelings of deep
                                    respect for their outstanding courage.” (Department of State <hi

                                <p><persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> sent a longer
                                    version of this statement to the President on October 9. The
                                    statement noted that the Hungarian people “rose against their
                                    oppressors” only to have their national independence “brutally
                                    crushed by Soviet armed force”. The statement continued that
                                    “the fierce love of freedom lives on” and indicated that the
                                    United States as well as other members of the United Nations had
                                    “constantly sought to relieve the suffering and rectify the
                                    injustice inflicted on the Hungarian people”. It concluded with
                                    the pledge to “continue to strive for the goal of a Hungarian
                                    nation that is as free as it is brave”. (Department of State,

                            questioned the wisdom of issuing the statement, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> said that he, too, had his
                            doubts. However, he said that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> was
                            very strong for it. President could not see how it would help the
                            Hungarian people—said it was nothing but an occasion when we would again
                            say look out for the Communists.</p>
                        <p>The President finally said he would call <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Allen Dulles</persName> in to ask why he thought it was

                            of United States policy toward the <persName corresp="#p_KJ1"
                                >Kadar</persName> regime, with particular reference to cultural
                            exchange and the travel of United States citizens to Hungary. The
                            purpose of the present despatch is to carry this thinking somewhat
                            further, into the field of political relations with the existing
                            Hungarian Government.</p>
                        <p>As a result of the initial success of the revolution of October 1956 and
                            the inability of internal Communist forces to subdue this revolt and to
                            maintain in power a Communist government linked with and subordinate to
                            Moscow, the Kremlin took overt action to suffocate the revolution and to
                            set up a puppet regime under <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Janos
                                Kadar</persName>. It was the fact that foreign troops were fighting
                            in Hungary and violently repressing the rights of the Hungarian people
                            which led to various resolutions condemning the USSR being passed by the
                            United Nations, caused the United States (with certain other countries)
                            not to enter into “normal” relationships with the <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> regime, resulted in the
                            preparation of the “Report of the Special Committee on the Problem of
                            Hungary”, and led to the designation of Prince Wan as Special
                            Representative of the General Assembly to achieve the objectives of the
                            United Nations’ resolutions.</p>
                        <p>There have been indications in the press and in the Department’s telegram
                            No. 135 of September 28, 1957,<note n="4" xml:id="d273fn4">Not printed.
                                (Department of State, Central Files, 320.5764/9–2657)</note> that
                            Prince Wan has seen the Soviet and Hungarian Foreign Ministers at the
                            United Nations. The Press Officer at the Hungarian Foreign Ministry, at
                            a press conference on October 12, 1957, stated, in connection with a
                            question concerning the possibility of a visit of Prince Wan to Hungary:
                            “Prince Wan did not want to come to Hungary as a private person. He
                            called, at his own request, on <persName corresp="#p_HI1">Imre
                                Horvath</persName>, Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs, and asked
                            him to be allowed to travel to Hungary and to carry on investigations
                            there on the basis of the instructions received from the General
                            Assembly of the United Nations. <persName corresp="#p_HI1">Imre
                                Horvath</persName>, Minister of Foreign Affairs, told him in his
                            reply that—as the Hungarian Government had also in the past regarded the
                            sending of a United Nations <pb n="680" xml:id="pg_680" facs="0710"
                            />observer to Hungary as interference in the domestic affairs of the
                            country—Hungary, for the same reason, being an independent and free
                            country, would not be able to grant him an entrance visa.” The Legation
                            has no information as to what further action may be contemplated by
                            Prince Wan.</p>
                        <p>So far as the Legation has been able to observe, there has been no
                            indication of any softening on the part of the Kremlin toward Hungary
                            and, equally, no sign of any softening on the part of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> regime toward those who
                            participated in the revolution or toward those who may be considered
                            unsympathetic to the present regime and its dependence upon the USSR. A
                            wave of arrests, running into the many thousands, occurred in August and
                            September. Violent attacks on the United Nations Report and on the
                            General Assembly were made by the regime during the final session of the
                            XI General Assembly. Press reports of trials were reduced during this
                            period, but they are again appearing regularly and political arrests
                            have once more become routine. Speeches by high officials of the regime
                            have taken a consistently “tough” line, the latest being a long harangue
                            by the Prime Minister at a conference of party activists on October 11,
                            shortly after his return from Peking and Moscow.</p>
                        <p>As for the policy of the Kremlin, the Legation’s reading of the
                            international news is that the Russians have again adopted a harsh line
                            in their dealings with the West and are apparently taking the view that
                            any liberalization in program of a Socialist-oriented country inevitably
                            dooms that country’s Socialist efforts. The Kremlin appears fully
                            preoccupied with the situation in the Middle East and in the
                            earth-satellite and ballistic fields and is, therefore, disinclined even
                            to consider the possibility of a change in policy toward Hungary or its
                            other East European satellites at the present time. The probability that
                            any easing of the internal pressures in these countries would be
                            tantamount to the opening of a Pandora’s box and would require military
                            dispensations and the exercise of constant political attention and
                            supervision which the Kremlin cannot afford in the light of its present
                            preoccupation elsewhere has probably been more than confirmed by recent
                            developments in Warsaw. The filling out of the Russian divisions in
                            Hungary, their being supplied with modern T–54 tanks and other similar
                            weapons, and the maintenance of troops and equipment at a high point of
                            efficiency are a further indication that the USSR is not prepared to
                            countenance any changes or untoward events in this country at the
                            present juncture. In any event, the Legation’s scanning of the Eastern
                            political horizon has thus far revealed no patch of light, indicating
                            the possibility of an early easing of the pressure on Communist
                            nerve-centers and, in particular, on the policy being pursued by the
                            Kremlin in Hungary both directly and through its local instrument, the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> regime.</p>
                        <pb n="681" xml:id="pg_681" facs="0711"/>
                        <p>The possibility that the Kremlin might make some change in the top
                            command of the present regime in Hungary has been suggested,
                            particularly prior to the final debate of the Hungarian question in the
                            XI General Assembly. Since such action was not taken at that time, when
                            it might have had some effect (favorable to the Russians) in the voting
                            at the General Assembly, and since <persName corresp="#p_KJ1"
                                >Kadar</persName>’s authority appears to be on the increase, there
                            seems little reason to think that any significant changes will be made
                            in the near future. The concomitant question also arises: Who could be
                            selected as a replacement for <persName corresp="#p_KJ1"
                                >Kadar</persName>, who might be as acceptable to the Russians and at
                            the same time might have some appeal for those nations and peoples who
                            have been and continue to be strongly critical of Russia’s bald
                            intervention in the internal affairs of Hungary? The Legation is unable
                            to find such a person in the present political firmament in Hungary.</p>
                        <p>The prospects for an early success of Prince Wan’s mission and of some
                            change in the Russian position in and policy toward Hungary would,
                            therefore, appear to be not particularly encouraging. If this analysis
                            of the existing situation and of the probable outcome of the latest
                            efforts by the United Nations is accurate, it would seem not
                            inappropriate for the Department and the Legation to consider what
                            changes, if any, in our policy toward the present regime in Hungary
                            might be appropriate. The Legation, in the three despatches under
                            reference, has already made certain very limited recommendations. It
                            would seem advisable, however, to consider the broader field—of our
                            diplomatic relations with the existing government in Hungary—in order to
                            determine whether there should be any changes on our part, despite the
                            fact that early changes on the part of the Russians seem improbable.</p>
                        <p>There has already been a slight easing of the tension between the regime
                            and the Western diplomatic missions in Budapest. In the case of the
                            American Legation, this tendency was initiated with the departure of Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WET1">Wailes</persName> (who had never
                            presented his credentials to any Hungarian Chief of State) and the
                            arrival of a new officer (“uncontaminated”, in the eyes of the regime,
                            by direct contact with and knowledge of the revolution) to assume the
                            duties of Chargé d’Affaires <gloss target="#t_ai1">a.i</gloss>. It was
                            further determined that the Chiefs of most of the Western missions
                            should accept the invitation of the Foreign Minister to a non-propaganda
                            film showing and reception on July 2 and that the Foreign Minister and a
                            few other officials of the Foreign Office should be invited to the
                            Fourth of July reception and other National Day receptions. There has
                            also been some slight increase in official contact between the Western
                            missions and the Foreign Office, but this has been minimal and has been
                            limited strictly to business representation regarding specific problems
                            between the regime and the respective missions. The Foreign Minister did
                            not attend the Fourth of July reception <pb n="682" xml:id="pg_682"
                                facs="0712"/>and the regime has not made great efforts to take
                            advantage of or to expand this slight rapprochement on the part of the
                            West, except that invitations to cultural affairs have been more
                            frequent, as have contacts between the Hungarian General Staff and the
                            Service Attachés of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> missions.
                            However, the continuance of the virulent attacks on the West by the
                            press and by the highest officials of the regime and the arrest of
                            Hungarian members of the staffs of Western missions, on the one hand,
                            and the publication of the United Nations Report on Hungary and the
                            resolution passed by the XI General Assembly at its final session, on
                            the other hand, have reaffirmed the rigidity of position between the
                            Western diplomatic missions and the <persName corresp="#p_KJ1"
                                >Kadar</persName> regime and have made it unlikely that any tendency
                            toward a thawing of this situation will develop without a definite
                            policy change on one side or the other. Since situations of this kind
                            seldom remain static for long periods, there exists, therefore, the
                            possibility that the relationships between the two sides will
                            deteriorate still further unless remedial steps are taken.</p>
                        <p>The only change on the part of the West which would satisfy the <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> regime would be the application of
                            “normal diplomatic relationships” to it by the West. This would mean,
                            for us, the designation of a Minister to this Legation. It would,
                            likewise, mean the entering into regular official and social relations
                            with the Government here and the attempt to settle outstanding problems
                            through the usual diplomatic procedures. It would mean, as well, the
                            recognition of the credentials of the Hungarian Delegation at the United
                            Nations and, presumably, would entail some means of cancelling action
                            contemplated by the various resolutions of censorship against Hungary
                            and the USSR adopted by the XI General Assembly. It would also mean an
                            easing of economic restrictions which have been placed on trade between
                            Hungary and the West, although it is probable that this would not be
                            made a sine qua non and that time, tide, and developments in other
                            fields (political, cultural, travel, etc.) would be permitted to work
                            their corroding effect on economic restrictions.</p>
                        <p>What quid pro quo might the Russians (as the ultimate masters of policy
                            in Hungary) be prepared to give in return for some (and ultimately, all)
                            of these concessions on the part of the West? Insofar as the United
                            States is concerned, the changes to be effected would include (1) the
                            trial or release of Legation Hungarian personnel at present in prison
                            and a cessation of the molestation of our personnel; (2) the lifting of
                            the limitation on the size of the Legation’s staff; (3) a liberalization
                            in cultural exchanges and travel restrictions; and (4) a satisfactory
                            arrangement with respect to Cardinal Mindszenty.</p>
                        <p>However, insofar as the Western powers generally are concerned, any
                            easing of relations would have to go at least some way to meet the
                            condemnations expressed in the various resolutions of the United <pb
                                n="683" xml:id="pg_683" facs="0713"/>Nations and would necessitate a
                            decided change in Russian policy toward this country. As indicated
                            above, the Legation sees no sign that the Kremlin is disposed at the
                            present time to make appreciable changes in Hungary or in its policy
                            toward Hungary. Any easing of its present pressure, even in return for
                            some or all of the above-listed concessions from the West, might run the
                            risk of giving encouragement to the Hungarian people, the vast majority
                            of whom (in the Legation’s considered opinion) are fundamentally
                            anti-Russian, violently anti-Communist, and deeply dissatisfied with the
                            situation of their country under Communist administration and Russian
                            domination. The prospect, therefore, would seem to be that, in order to
                            accomplish some normalization of our relations with Hungary at the
                            present time and under existing East-West tensions, an almost complete
                            backdown on the part of the West and of the other countries which have
                            censored Russian action in Hungary by their votes at the United Nations
                            would become necessary.</p>
                        <p>There are, of course, deficiencies in the existing situation for the
                            West. The lack of normal official contact with the government makes it
                            extremely difficult for the Western capitals to be properly informed
                            with respect to the thinking and policies of an important segment of the
                            Communist world. There is no opportunity for an exchange of ideas and
                            the possible exercise (admittedly a remote possibility) of some
                            moderating influence. The very absence of such contact, despite the
                            presence of the Western missions in Budapest, is an irritation in itself
                            and undoubtedly causes the regime to take positions and actions which it
                            might otherwise not take. Finally, the “affront” to the regime results
                            in its taking annoying, but effectively crippling, action against the
                            Western missions, such as pressure on or arrest of its local staff
                            members and limitations on the size and activities of the missions.</p>
                        <p>For the United States, these limitations are administered to the fullest
                            degree, since we are considered the leaders in the attack on the regime
                            in the United Nations. Our contact with any Hungarians—official or
                            non-official—is now reduced almost to the vanishing point. Our
                            staff—both American and Hungarian—has been severely cut and there is
                            constant interference with and pressure on the remaining Hungarians. In
                            addition, we have the question of Cardinal Mindszenty, whose refuge in
                            the Chancery is a point of periodic attack and a source of deep
                            irritation to the <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName>
                            regime.</p>
                        <p>In face of these deficiencies for us, it is obviously desirable that
                            every possibility of improvement in the situation be explored. As
                            indicated above, however, the Legation is unable to suggest any program
                            which would be likely to meet the desired objective at the present time.
                            The fact of the matter is that the Communist policy for Budapest is
                            determined in Moscow and no change in that policy seems probable in the
                            light of existing international preoccupations and the <pb n="684"
                                xml:id="pg_684" facs="0714"/>Kremlin’s seeming determination to
                            retain as much of the status quo in Eastern Europe—and particularly in
                            Hungary—as possible. The only possibility for improvement would be a
                            complete back-down on our part and, even if such a step were effected,
                            there is serious doubt that it would result in any appreciable
                            improvement in our relations with Hungary—or with the USSR—under
                            existing international tensions.</p>
                        <p>The Legation, therefore, recommends that our policy toward the <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> regime and toward the USSR (so far
                            as its relations with Hungary are concerned) not be altered at the
                            present time. It is suggested that we await developments in connection
                            with Prince Wan’s assignment, in the hope (admittedly not great) that
                            his efforts will result in some slight easing of the situation in
                            Hungary. If such easing should occur, we should, of course, be prepared
                            to take prompt advantage thereof by seeking—together with the other
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> powers—to improve relations
                            with whatever government may then exist in Budapest. The Legation
                            regrets to see a continuation of the present rigidity of positions
                            between the two sides, but it is believed that overall international
                            factors outside Hungary are determining at the present time and that no
                            useful purpose would be served by seeking to alter the local situation
                            in the face of these broader and presently more important international
                            considerations.</p>

                        <p>On October 31, representatives of the United States and Poland began a
                            series of economic negotiations at the Department of State. These talks
                            grew out of the earlier agreement of June 7 between the two countries
                            for the sale and credits for $95 million worth of wheat, cotton, and
                            other commodities. Text of the agreement is printed in Department of
                            State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, June 24, 1957, pages 1005–1008.
                            See also <ref target="#d253">Document 253</ref>. The Polish delegation
                            for the October 31 negotiations was headed by Tadeusz Lychowski,
                            Economic Minister at the Polish Embassy in Washington. W.T.M. Beale,
                            Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, headed the
                            American delegation. The meetings continued through November. By the end
                            of the month the Polish delegation submitted an extensive list of
                            credits and agricultural and other commodities needed from the United
                            States to fulfill Poland’s 1958 requirements, a total program amounting
                            to $97.3 million. In addition, the Polish delegation requested extension
                            to Poland <pb n="685" xml:id="pg_685" facs="0715"/>of

                            encouragement of American investment in Poland. (<hi rend="italic"

                        <p>In a memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>,
                            December 2, Beale concluded that the requirements submitted by the
                            Polish delegation were reasonable. He noted that such American
                            assistance would have an appreciable effect on the Polish economy at a
                            critical time, and would strengthen those elements in Poland favoring
                            stronger economic ties with the West. Beale recommended agreeing to the
                            $97.3 million program. For maximum economic, political, and
                            psychological impact, he believed that the agreement should be signed
                            before the end of the year. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., Central

                        <p>A year has now passed since the outbreak of the Hungarian Revolution.
                            During this period US policy on the Hungarian question has been aimed
                            primarily at: (a) exerting pressure through the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> and world public opinion on the Soviet Union to bring
                            about some amelioration of the repressive situation in Hungary; (b)
                            circulating as widely as possible a true picture of events in Hungary so
                            that the nature of Soviet imperialism and the failure of Communist
                            ideology may be widely understood, particularly in the non-committed
                            areas; (c) making clear to the world at large and to the Hungarian
                            people that the US views the present Hungarian regime as
                            unrepresentative and as completely subservient to the Soviet Union. We
                            have achieved considerable <pb n="686" xml:id="pg_686" facs="0716"
                            />success in publicizing the lessons of the Hungarian Revolution and by
                            now we have established beyond any doubt our attitude toward the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> regime. We have not been
                            successful, however, in forcing the Soviets to yield to public pressure
                            and adopt a more liberal and humane policy in Hungary. The <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> regime, in the words of our
                            Legation in Budapest, has “now largely accomplished its physical
                            consolidation”; the position of <persName corresp="#p_KJ1"
                                >Kadar</persName>, himself, following his recent return from
                            Communist China appears to be stronger than ever before; a terroristic
                            policy of suppression has been maintained; and Soviet troops continue to
                            occupy Hungary actually in increased rather than decreased numbers.
                            Meanwhile, there are signs that our potential for exerting pressure
                            through world public opinion is decreasing as the Revolution itself
                            fades into the past. We are thus faced with the likelihood that our aim
                            of bringing about in the immediate future any real liberalization in
                            Hungary largely through the pressure of world opinion is not
                            attainable.</p>
                        <p>It would appear then that we should henceforth pursue somewhat more
                            flexible and realistic objectives. We would define these as sustaining
                            the morale and aspirations of the Hungarian people to the extent
                            possible, encouraging whatever liberal forces and tendencies may appear
                            in Hungary, and making clear to the people and to the regime, itself,
                            the advantages of a “national” orientation as opposed to total Soviet
                            domination. The pursuit of these objectives may well require some
                            modifications in our current tactical policy toward the Hungarian
                            regime. This has been the subject of three recent despatches from
                            Budapest, copies of which are attached,<note n="2" xml:id="d275fn2"
                                >Despatches 217, 218, and 219 from Budapest, all dated October 11.

                                despatch 217.</note> in which the Legation suggests that the time
                            may be approaching when increased travel of American citizens to Hungary
                            and some cultural exchanges would prove beneficial to our own interests
                            and to the Hungarian people. Naturally as long as the Hungarian regime
                            is pursuing its present policy of terror, the US cannot make any large
                            gesture which might redound to the direct benefit of this regime. Like
                            the Legation, however, we feel that considerable advantage might accrue
                            from a quiet and gradual modification of some aspects of our current
                            policy, particularly since we fear that our present extremely rigid
                            tactics may lead to a dead end from which retreat will become
                            increasingly difficult. The moderations which we would suggest pertain
                            to travel and cultural exchanges, as suggested by the Legation, and, in
                            addition, to social contacts with diplomatic representatives of the
                            existing Hungarian regime.</p>

                        <p>In considering our policy in these fields it may be useful to review
                            briefly the present status quo:</p>

                                prior to the Hungarian Revolution the travel of American citizens to
                                Hungary was restricted and most passports were stamped not valid for
                                travel in Hungary. During the summer of 1956, in recognition of the
                                somewhat improved political situation in Hungary and the more
                                cooperative attitude of the Government toward our Legation, travel
                                to Hungary was being permitted with increased liberality and a
                                number of businessmen’s passports were validated in addition to
                                journalists and persons with compassionate reasons for visiting
                                Hungary. When the Revolution broke out the passport restriction was
                                again rigidly enforced and in the post-Revolutionary period we have
                                thus far validated the passports only of accredited journalists,
                                persons with extremely compassionate reasons for travel to Hungary
                                and individuals connected with the American relief effort there.
                                Requests of businessmen and persons desiring to visit relatives have
                                been consistently denied. Since the Hungarian regime in turn has
                                granted only a few visas to American journalists, the number of
                                American citizens entering Hungary has been sparse indeed.</item>

                            credentials of the Hungarian representatives. On the other hand our
                            present policy severely restricts the possibilities of contact between
                            the Hungarian people (as opposed to the regime) and our own. As the
                            Legation points out, US cultural contacts with Hungary are now
                            considerably less than those with the Soviet Union notwithstanding the
                            fact that the Hungarian people have made abundantly clear their thirst
                            for all types of association with Western culture. The reasons for this
                            are clear but it does in a sense penalize the wrong party. The travel of
                            more US citizens to Hungary would inevitably give more Hungarians an
                            opportunity of learning of life in America and would probably contribute
                            to their understanding of American policy during the Revolution.
                            Increased cultural exchanges would be impressive evidence that the US
                            continues to be interested in Hungary while at the same time
                            illustrating to the Hungarian people our cultural accomplishments and
                            giving to them further justification for feeling that they remain within
                            the main stream of Western civilization. Moreover, these increased
                            contacts would pose an additional problem for the regime in its efforts
                            to achieve political domination over the population since in this
                            struggle the regime’s most potent ally next to the presence of Soviet
                            forces could be a feeling of desperation and isolation among the
                            people.</p>
                        <p>Any marked change in our policy toward social relations with the
                            representatives of the existing regime would probably be unwise in view
                            of the status of the Hungarian question in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> and misleading concerning our own attitude toward the
                            regime. But some slight moderation which would give our Chargé in
                            Budapest somewhat more discretion in this field might increase the
                            information which we obtain concerning developments in Hungary and
                            render somewhat more stable the position of our mission in Budapest.
                            Moreover, it would put us in a more favorable position to encourage any
                            liberal trends which might become apparent within the Hungarian
                            leadership. Such a moderation in Budapest to be effective at all would
                            have to be reflected to a small extent in our policy in other posts
                            throughout the world.</p>
                        <p>On the whole we believe that the advantages of modifying our policy in
                            the three fields under discussion outweigh by a considerable margin the
                            disadvantages particularly in the light of our long range aims. It can
                            be argued, of course, that we should await some improvement in the
                            situation in Hungary or at least some conciliatory gesture on the part
                            of the existing regime before we institute even minor <pb n="689"
                                xml:id="pg_689" facs="0719"/>relaxations in our policy. This, it is
                            believed, would only be logical if the relaxations would work in favor
                            of the Hungarian Communists and the Soviets. Actually the relaxations,
                            in our view, would serve <hi rend="italic">our</hi> aims primarily and
                            to delay their implementation would, in effect, be to work against our
                            own purposes. At the same time it is clear that we must proceed slowly
                            in order to avoid any impression of a basic revision in our attitude
                            toward the existing regime and to enable us to take into consideration
                            any changes that occur in Hungary whether they be for the better or for
                            the worse.</p>

                            <item><hi rend="italic">Poland</hi>. Significant progress toward the
                                weakening of Soviet domination of Poland has occurred since the
                                establishment last October of the <persName corresp="#p_GW1"
                                    >Gomulka</persName> regime. The trend toward internal freedom in
                                Poland has been far more significant than anywhere else in Eastern
                                Europe, including Yugoslavia. This is manifested particularly by the
                                freedom of the Catholic Church to exist without serious government
                                interference and the resultant prestige and powerful influence of
                                Cardinal Wyszynski; the relative freedom of personal expression; the
                                elimination of a number of barriers to communication with the West,
                                including informal U.S. information and cultural activities; the
                                substantial decollectivization in agriculture; limited
                                experimentation with non-Marxist ideas in economic planning and
                                management; and, perhaps most important, the elimination of the
                                terror and diminution of the influence of the secret police. Poland
                                has become an example of evolutionary progress which has had a great
                                impact throughout Eastern Europe reaching into the USSR itself. This
                                progress, toward both our general interim objectives outlined in
                                paragraph 14 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>

                                action with respect to Poland outlined in paragraphs 11 through 14
                                of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5616/2, was primarily due to
                                internal factors, although U.S. official postures and programs have
                                undoubtedly had some influence. The initial liberalization trend in
                                Poland has been checked, and it has been made clear that the regime
                                will not tolerate freedom of expression, public assembly, strikes,
                                or other activity on a scale which might catalyze disaffected
                                elements into actions which would ultimately threaten the regime.
                                Initial popular enthusiasm for the <persName corresp="#p_GW1"
                                    >Gomulka</persName> regime has apparently declined as evidenced
                                by a growing attitude of indifference punctuated by an increasing
                                number of indications of unrest and open manifestations of
                                discontent. The economic situation in Poland remains critical. The
                                ability of the <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> regime
                                to maintain itself in power depends, to a major extent, upon whether
                                it can effect any significant improvement in economic conditions;
                                such improvement cannot be achieved without substantial foreign
                                assistance or substantially increased trade with the Free World. To
                                date there has been only limited success in reorienting Polish trade
                                toward the West and in inducing other countries of Western Europe,
                                particularly Great Britain and West Germany, to offer economic
                                assistance and trade inducements (see Annex A.);<note n="3"

                                possibilities of closer relations with Poland have been postponed
                                due to Yugoslav recognition of East Germany. Unless the Poles have
                                real hope for continuing economic assistance from sources other than
                                the Soviet bloc, it is difficult for them to take the additional
                                steps necessary to reorient their trade toward the West and to give
                                them an alternative to complete dependence on Moscow. The problem is
                                to determine, and make available, the U.S. and Free World assistance
                                required to provide a justifiable basis for this hope.</item>

                                in the period under review. Certain developments in Czechoslovakia
                                in the last year have probably been in a direction favorable to
                                long-run U.S. interests. Czechoslovakia is now open to American
                                tourists, several thousand of whom have visited the country in the
                                last year, and more Czechoslovak citizens are now being allowed to

                                plans for a U.S. tour by the Czech Philharmonic and thereby to

                            demonstrating Free World interest in and concern for the welfare of the
                            Polish people. It also added to Poland’s relatively independent status
                            in the eyes of world public opinion. All these positive factors were
                            circumscribed in the Polish mind, however, by what they felt was a
                            limited quantity of aid and by the delays and difficulties surrounding
                            the negotiations with the U.S. Economic aid has been of importance so
                            far principally to assist in warding off the collapse of the Polish
                            economy. The continuation of <persName corresp="#p_GW1"
                                >Gomulka</persName>’s middle-of-the-road policies depends in large
                            part upon his acceptability to the Polish population, who, in turn, will
                            be more willing to support him if there remains hope for improvement in
                            the economic situation. Available information on economic conditions in
                            Poland indicates that Polish needs for imports of grain and cotton
                            cannot be entirely financed by the Poles themselves from the resources
                            likely to be available to them within the next year or so without a
                            severe readjustment of their import program and an increased dependence
                            on the Soviet bloc. Despite a great effort the present housing
                            construction program of the <persName corresp="#p_GW1"
                                >Gomulka</persName> regime cannot keep pace with the growing need in
                            this area. There has been only a small improvement in availability of
                            agricultural commodities, consumer goods and services. Without
                            substantial outside financial assistance, this situation is unlikely to
                            improve except in agricultural production which may be stimulated by
                            increased private initiative. Advancement toward U.S. policy objectives
                            in Poland is closely linked to an improvement in the Polish economic
                            situation and its reorientation toward the West. It is not necessary for
                            the U.S. to match the level of Soviet bloc economic aid to Poland to
                            advance our objectives there; but rather to insure that our aid is
                            timely and effective. The Polish requirements (presented in quantities)
                            have not yet been fully evaluated. It is estimated that, in any event,
                            their equivalent value will be considerably in excess of the amount
                            which has tentatively been programmed under Title I of <gloss

                            amount available under Section 401 of the Mutual Security Act, namely,
                            $30 million. The tentative program, therefore, is of approximately the
                            same magnitude as that provided under the earlier agreements. The
                            Department of State has not yet requested allocation of the latter
                            amount under Section 401 of the MSA pending further examination of the
                            Polish request. The figures indicated above reflect the present
                            limitations, as far as the U.S. is concerned, for two principal reasons:
                            (1) Under <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480, any amounts additional
                            to those already reserved for Poland could only be obtained by
                            disregarding high priority requirements of other countries or by
                            securing additional <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 authority from
                            the Congress, and (2) Section 401 of the Mutual Security Act stipulates
                            that not more than $30 million of the funds available under this section
                            may be allocated to any one nation in any one fiscal year.</p>

                            objectives in Eastern Europe, through the provision under certain

                            or other aid agreements with satellite countries, such as Poland, which

                            the question, reacted favorably to the Department’s proposal that MFN

                                increases in consular work resulting from the easing of Polish

                                nevertheless been useful in narrowing the area of disagreement in
                                this matter. The talks are still continuing. There is a strong
                                possibility that at its next session Congress will pass legislation

                                the passage of a bill on this subject. Lawyers of the interested
                                agencies are now preparing an administration bill to replace a

                                would probably result in a breaking off of the negotiations with the
                                Czechs for an agreed settlement and could worsen somewhat our

                            that the Bulgarian Government had asked the Poles to approach the State

                            the question was first raised, the Bulgarians would like to receive some
                            official answer. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FEL1">Freers</persName>
                            stated that there has been no change in our official position, that we
                            had no relations with Bulgaria, and have made no decision to work toward
                            resumption of relations. He said that some change had been made in our
                            passport validation policy, as Mr. Jaroszek was aware. He said that the
                            question of our relations with Bulgaria was under continuous review. The
                            Polish approach on behalf of the Bulgarians would be considered, and an

                                Moscow declaration of November 21 was signed by the leaders of all
                                12 “Sino-Soviet bloc” parties. In regard to international relations,
                                the declaration scored the “war danger” created by an allegedly
                                reactionary United States and called for opposition by the the
                                Communist world, socialists, and neutralists. A specific assessment
                                of Poland’s role is in a memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_ECB1"

                            represented Polish policy, but he assumed that it did not or Poland
                            would not be negotiating to improve economic relations at this

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that he had called
                            the Ambassador in to see what he might have to say or what he might
                            obtain from his Government to interpret the Moscow Declaration.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he was not authorized to make a statement on the
                            Moscow Declaration. However, he could say that this Declaration did not
                            represent any change in the policy of the Polish Government. Polish
                            relations with other socialist countries and with the West was unchanged
                            from what it has been since the events of October 1956. He said that he
                            felt those who were aware of the development of Polish affairs should
                            not attach undue importance to this Declaration but should judge the
                            facts. The facts were that cultural relations with the West had expanded
                            and that their objective was that half the trade of Poland would be with
                            the West and half with the Soviet Union and the socialist countries. He
                            referred to the Secretary’s talk with the Polish Foreign Minister<note
                                n="5" xml:id="d278fn5">See <ref target="#d271">Document
                                271</ref>.</note> in which the Secretary had expressed a hope for
                            better relations with the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> agreed that improved
                            relations with the Soviet Union were desirable but that when the Polish
                            Government signed a declaration which might be expected from the
                            U.S.S.R. but not from Poland, we naturally were concerned as to its
                            meaning. He reiterated that he felt it was best to put our problem
                            frankly and that the statements made by the Ambassador were along
                            helpful lines; it would be of further help if the Ambassador could also
                            obtain additional information from his Government concerning this
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he would do so, but he wanted to make it clear that
                            he would personally be very disappointed if the Moscow Declaration did
                            anything to obstruct the progress of improved economic relations with
                            the United States, and he felt that this was also his Government’s view.
                            At this point he made a guarded reference to the difficulties the Polish
                            Government and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> faced.
                            He asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> if it would
                            be possible to bring the negotiations to a conclusion before the end of
                            the year, as he wondered whether there might be some problem with
                            Congress should the talks continue into January.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that he had not
                            put any time limit on the negotiations. He said we had now obtained
                            about all the information needed in order to make our decision. He said
                            that he would be leaving for the Paris meeting<note n="6"

                            basis of what information he had obtained from Warsaw. However, as funds

                            which he stated that the foreign policy of Poland and its attitude
                            toward the United States had not changed since the events of October
                            1956. He said that now he spoke with the full authority of his
                            government and had been instructed to confirm officially that the
                            foreign policy of Poland had not changed. In support of this statement
                            he mentioned the remarks of Foreign Minister Rapacki on December 15 to
                            the Polish Parliament. The Foreign Minister explained at that time that
                            Poland was seeking peaceful solutions to world problems and desired
                            cooperation of Poland with countries having different social systems.
                            The Ambassador added that Poland was worried by recent international
                            developments and wanted to avoid a division of the world into two
                            camps.</p>
                        <p>So far as Polish-American relations were concerned, the present economic
                            negotiations constituted an expression of Polish desire. These
                            negotiations were being conducted in a straightforward manner and all
                            questions were being answered frankly in order to bring about a better
                            understanding of the Polish economic situation. When an <pb n="702"
                                xml:id="pg_702" facs="0732"/>agreement is reached after a full
                            exploration of Poland’s needs, this would have a tremendous effect on
                            Poland and on other Eastern European countries as well.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the general changes which have taken place in Polish
                            foreign policy there have been extensive technical exchanges. These
                            exchanges constitute a good beginning and are very helpful in overcoming
                            misunderstandings. During the past year it is worthy of note that
                            agreements have been entered into between Poland and such American
                            organizations as ING, The Joint Distribution, and CARE. These agreements
                            concluded during 1957 indicate clearly the intention of the Poles to
                            establish closer relations with the United States.</p>
                        <p>As to the Moscow Declaration, the Ambassador said it was important to
                            note the difference between a Party declaration and a document signed by
                            the Polish Government. The language in the Moscow Declaration is a Party
                            expression. Moreover the language of some of the Parties was different
                            from that used by the Polish Party. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GW1"
                                >Gomulka</persName> has pointed out that there were differences in
                            meaning and in shades of meaning. The true interpretation of the Moscow
                            Declaration from Poland’s point of view was given by <persName
                                corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> when he said that there were no
                            strings attached to the Polish negotiations with the US for economic
                            assistance. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> had found
                            it necessary to emphasize this interpretation and it would be helpful
                            therefore not to draw erroneous conclusions from the Moscow
                            Declaration.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that the
                            statements of the Ambassador had been helpful and what he had said was
                            what we had hoped would be the case. However, it was difficult for us
                            and for the American public to draw a line of distinction between
                            statements of the Party and of the Government in Socialist countries.
                            The same relationship did not exist in the US. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> added that he hoped Poland would
                            have this difficulty in mind in making statements such as those in the
                            Moscow Declaration. However he saw no reason now why we could not
                            proceed with the negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that the delay in the current negotiation was causing
                            questions to be asked of the Embassy and he therefore wondered if it
                            would be possible to speed up the present talks. He felt that there was
                            some danger in waiting until Congress reconvened in January.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> expressed the opinion
                            that there was no reason for concern on these grounds.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then asked if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> felt it would be desirable to make further
                            contacts with Members of Congress. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> replied that he did not feel that this was
                            particularly required but that on a general basis it certainly would do
                            no harm for the Embassy to maintain its contacts with the members of the
                            Congress.</p>

                        <p>During the period 1955–1957, Finland’s political and economic stability
                            and its relations with the Soviet Union continued to be of interest to
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>From September 16 to 19, 1955, President Juho Paasikivi and Prime
                            Minister Urho Kekkonen, along with other officials, visited the Soviet
                            Union. The visit resulted in the signing on September 19 by Kekkonen and
                            Soviet Premier <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> of (1) a
                            protocol extending for 20 years the Finnish-Soviet treaty of friendship
                            and mutual assistance that had been concluded in 1948, and (2) an
                            agreement whereby the Soviet Union undertook to evacuate, and to return
                            to Finland, the naval base of Porkkala (12 miles southwest of Helsinki)
                            which had been leased to the Soviet Union under the terms of the Finnish
                            Peace Treaty signed in 1947. An analysis of the significance of these
