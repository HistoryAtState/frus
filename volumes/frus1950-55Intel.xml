    <head>Preface</head>
    <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents the
     official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and significant
     diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The Historian of the Department of State
     is charged with the responsibility for the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
      Relations</hi> series. The staff of the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs,
     under the direction of the General Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
     series, plans, researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. Secretary of State
      <persName>Frank B. Kellogg</persName> first promulgated official regulations codifying
     specific standards for the selection and editing of documents for the series on March 26, 1925.
     These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
    <p>Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, which was signed by President
      <persName>George H.W. Bush</persName> on October 28, 1991, established a new statutory charter
     for the preparation of the series. Section 198 of P.L. 102–138 added a new Title IV to the
     Department of State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 4351, et seq.).</p>
    <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be a thorough,
     accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy decisions and significant
     United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the series should include all records needed
     to provide comprehensive documentation of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the
     United States Government. The statute also confirms the editing principles established by
     Secretary <persName>Kellogg</persName>: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is
     guided by the principles of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered
     or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been made; the
     published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in reaching a decision; and
     nothing should be omitted for the purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute also
     requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30
     years after the events recorded. The editors are convinced that this volume meets all
     regulatory, statutory, and scholarly standards of selection and editing.</p>
    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Structure and Scope of the Foreign Relations
     Series</hi></p>
    <p>This volume is part of a retrospective subseries of volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
      Relations</hi> series that fills in gaps in the volumes of the <persName corresp="#p_THS1"
      >Truman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> subseries. At the
     time the <persName corresp="#p_THS1">Truman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
      >Eisenhower</persName> volumes were prepared, the Office of the Historian did not have access
     to documents related to intelligence. This is the second volume that documents the
     institutional foundations of the relationship between <pb n="IV" xml:id="pg_IV" facs="0004"
     />foreign policy and intelligence. The first, <ref target="frus1945-50Intel"><hi rend="italic"
       >Foreign Relations</hi>, 1945–1950, Emergence of the Intelligence Establishment</ref>, was
     published in 1996. This volume is a sequel, and it will be followed by a third volume with the
     same focus, covering the years 1956–1960. After 1960, the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
      Relations</hi> volumes for the <persName>Kennedy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_JP1"
      >Johnson</persName>, and <persName>Nixon-Ford</persName> subseries include a chapter on
     intelligence and foreign policy in their volumes on the organization and management of foreign
     policy, thus negating the need for separate retrospective volumes.</p>
    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Focus of Research and Principles of Selection for</hi>
     Foreign Relations, <hi rend="italic">1950–1955, Development of the Intelligence
     Community</hi></p>
    <p>This volume is organized along chronological lines in one large chapter covering 1950–1955,
     and a second chapter that includes the key National Security Council Intelligence Directives of
     the period. The volume documents the institutional growth of the intelligence community during
     the first half of the 1950s. When Lt. <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Walter Bedell
      Smith</persName> took over as Director of Central Intelligence in October 1950, he inherited
     an agency that was widely believed to have been unable to establish itself as the central
     institution of the U.S. intelligence community. Utilizing his great prestige, and a national
     security directive from President <persName corresp="#p_THS1">Truman</persName>, <persName
      corresp="#p_SGWB1">Smith</persName> established the multiple directorate structure within the
     Central Intelligence Agency (<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>) that has continued to this
     day, brought the clandestine service into the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, and worked
     to effect greater inter-agency coordination through a strengthened process to produce National
     Intelligence Estimates. The exponential growth of the national security establishment and of
     the intelligence community was due to the impact of two factors: <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
      >NSC</gloss> 68 (a clarion call for more active containment of the Soviet Union) and the
     Korean War. The Central Intelligence Agency was called upon to expand the clandestine service,
     and the intelligence community was required to provide better and more definitive intelligence
     on the Soviet bloc and China. When <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> took
     over as Director of Central Intelligence in February 1953, these pressures continued. By 1955,
     the general consensus of two commissions appointed by President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
      >Eisenhower</persName> to review the intelligence effort was that the clandestine service had
     grown too rapidly and was plagued by poor management. In general, the commission implied that
     the clandestine service’s growth had come at the expense of the agency’s intelligence
     analysts.</p>
    <p>This volume presented the editors with documentary challenges. The documents used to compile
     this volume were unique by <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> standards. Rather than
     documenting the formulation of foreign policy decisions or important diplomatic negotiations,
     this volume is a record of high-level policy plans, discussions, administrative decisions, and
     managerial actions that transformed the intelligence community from its somewhat shaky
     establishment into a community <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0005"/>that collected intelligence
     worldwide; provided extensive analysis of that intelligence for policy makers; and carried out
     covert operations, as approved by the United States Government, on a global scale. The
     intelligence community under President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> in
     1955 was a much more significant player and a more robust bureaucracy than it was under
     President <persName corresp="#p_THS1">Truman</persName> in the late 1940s. This volume
     documents that growth and development.</p>
    <p>In preparing this volume, the editors sought to limit their selection of documents to those
     dealing with national intelligence coordination, planning, and policies. The editors did not
     seek to document the planning and implementation of specific intelligence operations, or to
     document the impact of intelligence appraisals upon specific foreign policy decisions or
     negotiations. Intelligence reports, estimates, and analyses dealing with particular regions,
     countries, or issues have not been included. The important intelligence operations of the
      <persName corresp="#p_THS1">Truman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
      >Eisenhower</persName> years, missing in the coverage of <hi rend="italic">Foreign
      Relations</hi> for 1945–1960, are covered in other retrospective volumes. The first,
     Guatemala, 1952–1954, was published in 2003. Others will follow.</p>
    <p>The preparation of this volume raised special problems since many of the intelligence
     documents for 1950–1955 have been destroyed, or were widely scattered in multiple archival
     holdings. Documents were hard to locate because of the shifting and rapid growth of various
     intelligence organizations. It became obvious that some important decisions were probably
     reached without written records having been made. Still, this volume presents an extensive
     collection of documents that will go a long way to demonstrate the growth of the intelligence
     community during the key period 1950–1955. That growth and development was not without growing
     pains, as the documents reveal.</p>
    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Editorial Methodology</hi></p>
    <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time. Memoranda of
     conversation are placed according to the date and time of the conversation, rather than the
     date a memorandum was drafted. Documents chosen for printing are authoritative or signed
     copies, unless otherwise noted.</p>
    <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
      Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by guidance from the
     General Editor. The documents are reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or
     other notations, which are described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed
     according to accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents within the
     limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied by the editors for each document
     included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation are retained as found in the
     original text, except that obvious typographical errors are silently <pb n="VI" xml:id="pg_VI"
      facs="0006"/>corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the documents are corrected by
     bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an addition in roman type. Words or
     phrases underlined in the source text are printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions
     are preserved as found in the original text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the
     front matter of each volume.</p>
    <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an unrelated
     subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after declassification review (in italic
     type). The amount and, where possible, the nature of the material not declassified has been
     noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of text that were omitted. Entire documents
     withheld for declassification purposes have been accounted for and are listed with headings,
     source notes, and number of pages not declassified in their chronological place. All brackets
     that appear in the original text are so identified in footnotes. With the exception of
     Presidential recordings transcribed in the Office of the Historian by the editor(s) of the
     volume, all ellipses are in the original documents.</p>
    <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document’s source, original classification,
     distribution, and drafting information. This note also provides the background of important
     documents and policies and indicates whether the President or his major policy advisers read
     the document.</p>
    <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not printed in the
     volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources, provide references to
     important related documents printed in other volumes, describe key events, and provide
     summaries of and citations to public statements that supplement and elucidate the printed
     documents. Information derived from memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when
     appropriate to supplement or explicate the official record.</p>
    <p>The numbers in the index refer to document numbers rather than to page numbers.</p>
    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic
      Documentation</hi></p>
    <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under the <hi
      rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute, reviews records, advises, and makes
     recommendations concerning the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The Advisory
     Committee monitors the overall compilation and editorial process of the series and advises on
     all aspects of the preparation and declassification of the series. The Advisory Committee does
     not necessarily review the contents of individual volumes in the series, but it makes
     recommendations on issues that come to its attention and reviews volumes, as it deems necessary
     to fulfill its advisory and statutory obligations.</p>
    <pb n="VII" xml:id="pg_VII" facs="0007"/>
    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Declassification Review</hi></p>
    <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration, conducted the
     declassification review for the Department of State of the documents published in this volume.
     The review was conducted in accordance with the standards set forth in Executive Order 12958,
     as amended, on Classified National Security Information and other applicable laws.</p>
    <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information, subject only to
     the current requirements of national security, as embodied in law and regulation.
     Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the appropriate geographic and functional
     bureaus in the Department of State, other concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the
     appropriate foreign governments regarding specific documents of those governments. The
     declassification review of this volume, which began in 2002 and was completed in 2006, resulted
     in the decision to withhold 18 documents in full, excise a paragraph or more in 28 documents,
     and make minor excisions of less than a paragraph in 35 documents.</p>
    <p>The Office of the Historian is confident, on the basis of the research conducted in preparing
     this volume and as a result of the declassification review process described above, that
     notwithstanding the number of denied and excised documents, the record presented in this volume
     presented here provides an accurate and comprehensive account the development of the
     intelligence community, 1950–1955.</p>
    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Acknowledgments</hi></p>
    <p>The editors wish to acknowledge the assistance of officials at National Archives and Records
     Administration for their assistance in providing access to documents at the <persName
      corresp="#p_THS1">Truman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
     Presidential Libraries. <persName>David Haight</persName> at the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
      >Eisenhower</persName> Library was particularly helpful. The History Staff of the Center for
     the Study of Intelligence was extremely cooperative in assisting the editors in collecting
     relevant documents from Central Intelligence Agency files. <persName>Michael Warner</persName>,
     then Deputy Historian of the History Staff, was so instrumental in the production of this
     volume that he is listed as a co-editor. Special thanks to <persName>David Hatcher</persName>,
     Historian at the National Security Agency, and the historian at the Defense Intelligence
     Agency, who provided advice and key documents from their agencies.</p>
    <p>The retrospective volumes on the organization and development of the intelligence community
     during the <persName corresp="#p_THS1">Truman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
      >Eisenhower</persName> years was the brainchild of <persName>Neal Petersen</persName>, a long
     time editor of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> and an expert on intelligence history.
      <persName>Petersen</persName> retired from the Office of the Historian before the first volume
     on the <hi rend="italic">Establishment of the Intelligence Community</hi> was published in
     1996, but the idea and <pb n="VIII" xml:id="pg_VIII" facs="0008"/>basic concept was his.
      <persName>Douglas Keene</persName> and <persName>Michael Warner</persName> selected and
     annotated this volume under the supervision of <persName>David S. Patterson</persName>, then
     General Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The current General
     Editor, <persName>Edward C. Keefer</persName>, oversaw the final revisions and production of
     the volume. <persName>Susan Weetman</persName> and Dean <persName>Weatherhead</persName>
     coordinated the declassification of the volume and, with <persName>Edward Keefer</persName> and
      <persName>Renée</persName> Goings, prepared extensive declassification appeals which resulted
     in significantly more documentation being released. <persName>Florence Segura</persName> and
      <persName>Carl Ashley</persName> did the copy and technical editing. <persName>Caroline
      Sapp</persName> revised and updated the name list. <persName>Juniee Oneida</persName> prepared

    <p>In keeping with the statutory requirement of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
     series, the editors have complete access to all the retired records and papers of the
     Department of State: the decimal central files; the special decentralized files (“lot files”)
     at the bureau, office, and division levels; and the files of the Executive Secretariat.
     Virtually all the Department’s files have been permanently transferred to the National Archives
     and Records Administration at College Park, Maryland (Archives II). All of these files, which
     the exception of the <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss>/IL historical files, and the
     administrative lot file that was later destroyed, are open for research at the National
     Archives.</p>
    <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series also have full access to
     the papers of Presidents <persName corresp="#p_THS1">Truman</persName> and <persName
      corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, and other White House foreign policy records.
     Presidential papers maintained and preserved at the <persName corresp="#p_THS1"
      >Truman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> libraries include
     significant intelligence documentation from the Department of State and other federal agencies
     including the National Security Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of
     Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
    <p>The editors also have full access to the files of the Central Intelligence Agency still in
     the possession of the Agency as well as to records transferred from the Agency to the National
     Archives. The Central Intelligence Agency files were crucial to the preparation of this volume
     and they will be discussed below.</p>
    <p>Since this volume focuses on the development of intelligence, and not foreign policy and
     foreign relations, its sources are considerably different from most other <hi rend="italic"
      >Foreign Relations</hi> volumes. The decimal central files used for this volume are mainly
     intelligence-related, as reflected in the annotated source list below. The volume relies
     heavily on the retired files of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research (<gloss
      target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss>) at the Department of State. The most useful lot file was Lot 58
     D 776, covering <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss>’s work from 1945–1960. <gloss
      target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> lot files subsequently have been consolidated at the National
     Archives, but Lot 58 D 776 provides core documentation for that consolidated file. The files of
     the Policy Planning Staff (S/P) of the Department of State also proved very valuable,
     especially S/P Files, Lot 64 D 563 and S/P–<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Files, Lot 62 D
     1, both of which had key material on psychological warfare and the Psychological Strategy
     Board. The lot files of the Executive Secretariat (S/S) of the Department of State were also
     very useful, particularly S/S–<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>, Lot 62 D 333, which contains
     the minutes and related papers of the Psychological Strategy Board, 1951–1953. Also of value
     are <pb n="XII" xml:id="pg_XII" facs="0011"/> S/S–<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Files,
     Lot 63 D 351, the basic master files of the Department’s <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
     records for 1947–1961 and S/S–<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Files, Lot 66 D and
      S/S–<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Files, Lot 66 D 95, which both contain miscellaneous
      <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> records, with the latter containing <gloss
      target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> records of actions and some National Security Council
     Intelligence Directives (<gloss target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss>s). Finally, the <gloss
      target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss>/IL Historical Files have documentation on the preparation and
     working of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10 series, the papers establishing and refining
     responsibilities for covert operations. All lots mentioned above, with the exception of the
      <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss>/IL Historical Files, are available at the National
     Archives.</p>
    <p>The best Central Intelligence Agency files listed are those of the Executive Registry, the
     Directorate of Operations, and the History Staff. They are of equal importance to the
     Department of State lot files. The History Staff files require special explanation. The History
     Staff collection, maintained by the History Staff in the Center for the Study of Intelligence,
     contains documents selected over time by personnel of the various components of the Agency as
     having significant historical value and transferred to the physical custody of the History
     Staff to ensure their continued availability as part of the historical record. Documents in the
     historical collection tend to vary widely in nature and quality and usually provide only a
     partial record, but they are nonetheless a major resource and have been widely used in the
     preparation of this volume.</p>
    <p>The Central Intelligence Agency files from the Executive Registry, the various directorates,
     and the Intelligence Community Management Staff, have a more direct provenance. The Executive
     Registry files are the official records of the Director of Central Intelligence and are
     therefore crucial. The files of the Directorate of Operation were equally valuable, while the
     files of the Directorate of Intelligence and Directorate of Science and Technology, and the
     Community Management Staff were important, but not to the standard of the Executive Registry,
     History Staff files, or the Operations files.</p>
    <p>The editors did not do research in the massive files of the National Security Agency or the
     Defense Intelligence Agency, but instead relied upon the historians at those agencies to make
     available key documents upon request or recommendation. At the National Archives, research in
     Record Group 218, the Records of the Joint Chiefs of Staff provided a few key documents. Record
     Group 263, the Central Intelligence Agency Files at the National Archives also fell into that
     same category. At the time the research for this volume was done, RG 263, contained basically
     sources made available to <persName>Thomas Troy</persName> for use in preparation of his book
     on the founding of the Agency, declassified National Intelligence Estimates and Special
     National Intelligence Estimates, and declassified article from the Agency in-house journal, <pb
      n="XIII" xml:id="pg_XIII" facs="0012"/>
     <hi rend="italic">Studies in Intelligence</hi>. Since the research for this volume was
     undertaken, the Central Intelligence Agency has transferred more records to the National
     Archives and made others available on its website. Finally, Record Group 273, the records of
     the National Security Council contains some key <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policy
     papers, official minutes of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meetings, and <gloss
      target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss>s.</p>
    <p>Research at the <persName corresp="#p_THS1">Truman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
      >Eisenhower</persName> presidential libraries provided important documents, but certainly not
     to the magnitude or importance as the records of the Department of State or Central
     Intelligence Agency. At the <persName corresp="#p_THS1">Truman</persName> Library in the Papers
     of the President, the President’s Secretary’s File was the most important, followed closely by
     the Subject File with documents on organizing covert operation and copies of <gloss
      target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss>s. At the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
     Library the best files were the <persName>Whitman</persName> File (records kept by <persName
      corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s personal assistant <persName>Ann
     Whitman</persName>), the Staff Secretary Records, and the Records of the President’s Special
     Assistant for National Security Affairs.</p>

      <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. <persName>Childs</persName>:</p>
      <p>Reference is made to your memorandum of March 6, 1950, forwarding a draft interagency
       operating procedure for the proposed Watch Committee.<note n="2" xml:id="d3fn2">Not
        found.</note></p>
      <p>As you are aware, we are in full accord with the Watch Committee idea. We believe, however,
       that the specific procedures outlined in <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0034"/>the <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> proposal tend to obscure the method by which the Committee
       should operate and, indeed, the basic purpose for which the Committee needs to be
       established.</p>
      <p>In considering procedures for the Watch Committee, it is important to bear in mind that a
       committee is not needed merely to effect an exchange of pertinent items of information. The
       unique feature of a committee—and the reason a committee is needed in this field—is that it
       provides a mechanism whereby all such items of information may be juxtaposed, compared with
       each other, discussed, and jointly evaluated by the members. Similarly, the committee
       structure permits joint consideration of the important question: What are the proper and
       significant categories of information (indicators) having a bearing on Soviet intentions to
       make war in the near future?</p>
      <p>With this is mind we are submitting for your consideration a redraft of the agreement.<note
        n="3" xml:id="d3fn3">The enclosure, entitled “Draft of Proposed Interagency Operating
        Procedure,” was not found.</note> While there are a number of minor changes, the most
       important adjustments we propose are designed to emphasize this deliberative aspect of the
       Committee’s work. I should be glad to discuss it with you in detail at your convenience.</p>
      <p>I am sending copies of this letter to the other action addressees of your memorandum.<note

      <p>On June 18 [<hi rend="italic">17</hi>], 1948, at its 13th meeting, the National Security

       Central <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0035"/>Intelligence Agency an Office of Special
        Projects<note n="3" xml:id="d4fn3">The Office of Special Projects was the name originally
        proposed for the Office of Policy Coordination.</note> to plan and conduct covert
       operations, and in coordination with the Joint Chiefs of Staff to plan and prepare for the
       conduct of such operations in war time. The directive charged the Director of Central
       Intelligence with assuring <hi rend="italic">through designated representatives of the
        Secretary of State and of the Secretary of Defense</hi> that covert operations be planned
       and conducted in a manner consistent with United States foreign and military policies and
       with overt activities.</p>
      <p>Pursuant to this Directive, I was designated by <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">General
        Marshall</persName> as his representative for the above purpose, and this designation was
       officially made known to the Executive Secretary of the National Security Council by a letter
       signed August 13, 1948 by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LRA1">Lovett</persName>.<note n="4"
        xml:id="d4fn4">Not printed. (National Archives, RG 59, S/P Files: Lot 64 D 563, Political
        and Psychological Warfare)</note> Since that date, I have continued to bear this
       responsibility.</p>
      <p>My present preoccupation with other duties and my pending departure from the Department
       oblige me to recommend that I now be relieved of this responsibility, and I do so
       recommend.</p>
      <p>However, I do not think that any successor to me should be appointed in present
       circumstances; and I would urge that the National Security Council be informed that the
       Department will not be able to give further guidance on the exercise of this function by
        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> until certain prerequisites are met which could alone
       assure the soundness of the operation of these arrangements. These are: <list>
        <label>(a)</label>
        <item><p>There would have to be a marked improvement in the facilities for assuring the
          cooperation of security authorities of the Government in general, and the Department of
          Justice in particular, in the efforts of this Department and the Office of Special
          Projects to promote psychological warfare purposes.</p>
         <p>It was never to be expected that covert operations could be so conducted as to produce
          appreciable political results unless those charged with their conduct could command the
          cooperation and the confidence of all agencies of the United States Government. In a
          memorandum of conversation and understanding initialed on August 12, 1948 by Mr.
           <persName>Souers</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HRAR1">Admiral
           Hillenkoetter</persName>, Mr. <persName>Blum</persName>, Colonel
           <persName>Yeaton</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFG1">Wisner</persName> and
           myself,<note n="5" xml:id="d4fn5">The actual date of the meeting was August 6, 1948; the
           memorandum of conversation is printed in <ref target="frus1945-50Intel#d298"><hi
             rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1945–1950, Emergence of the Intelligence
            Establishment, Document 298</ref>.</note> designed to serve as the basic premises
          underlying the conduct of this work, it was agreed that the activity was to be considered
           <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0036"/>“a major political operation” and that “the greatest
          flexibility and freedom from the regulations and administrative standards governing
          ordinary operations” would be required for its successful prosecution.</p>
         <p>These requirements have not been adequately met. In particular, the Government has
          proven itself unable to take the necessary and appropriate action in matters concerning a
          number of the ex-communists and others who are the heart and soul of the potential
          ideological resistance to communism both here and abroad and whose movements in and out of
          this country are important to this purpose. Any political warfare efforts which purport to
          dispense with a free and flexible collaboration with these elements must be largely
          unrealistic. In addition to this, present restrictions on the exercise of executive
          discretion in the employment of persons by the United States Government place heavy
          handicaps on the fulfillment of the purposes of political and psychological warfare. I do
          not deny that positive results can still be obtained, in a fragmentary way and in limited
          areas of political warfare work where the cooperation of other agencies of the Government
          is not required. But in general the framework for the accomplishment of this work is so
          discouraging that prospects for success cannot be regarded as balancing out, in present
          circumstances, the other risks and disadvantages of the Department’s participation in
          it.</p></item>
        <label>(b)</label>
        <item><p>Some suitable arrangements would have to be devised to protect State Department
          personnel against personal damage to themselves arising out of their participation in this
          work.</p>
         <p>Experience has indicated that the issuance of political guidance to the Director of
          Central Intelligence in these matters is, in present circumstances, liable to distortion
          and exploitation in ways dangerous to the reputations and positions of the persons
          concerned in this Department. We have already had one instance in which the issuance of
          such guidance in good faith, through the proper channels and with the full authority of
          superior officers in this Department, has—without notification to anyone in this
          Department—been reported by the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to the <gloss
           target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> as possible evidence of political unreliability on the part
          of the State Department official concerned. We have no protection against this happening
          again and no assurance that any one in this Department will even be aware of it when it
          does happen. In these circumstances, I would consider it unjust to permit any official of
          this Department to have anything to do with this work without warning him that his
          participation in it may very well be used, unbeknownst to him, for the purpose of throwing
          suspicion on his character and his loyalty. And since it is obviously not a tolerable
          state of affairs that men should be asked to work in this atmosphere and in this jeopardy,
          I think it necessary that this matter be clarified before the Department of State can
          participate further in this work.</p>
         <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0037"/>
         <p>On point (a), above, I think it may still be possible to bring about some improvement by
          direct discussion with the agencies concerned—particularly with the Attorney General. If
          this proves not to be the case, it seems to me that our only resort is the National
          Security Council.</p>
         <p>On point (b), I think that this must in any event be taken up with the Executive
          Secretary of the National Security Council.</p>
         <p>You will appreciate that it is not without great concern and disappointment that I make
          this recommendation. The idea of the establishment of an organization of this sort for
          covert operations in the political field was largely my own, as was the initiative which
          led to the Department’s prominent part in launching this venture. It has been, and is, my
          conviction that the effective conduct of political warfare on the covert plane is
          indispensable to the prosecution of a successful policy toward the Soviet Union, designed
          to prevent a third world war and to reduce Soviet power and influence to tolerable
          dimensions. Anything which interferes, even temporarily, with the prosecution of this work
          seems to me to diminish materially the chances for defeating communist purposes on a
          world-wide scale.</p>
         <p>I would also like to make it clear that the above recommendation is not meant to be in
          any sense critical of the conduct of the work of the Office of Special Projects by Mr.
           <persName corresp="#p_WFG1">Wisner</persName> who, as far as I am able to observe, has
          struggled loyally and valiantly to make a success of this work under bitterly discouraging
          conditions and who has considerable accomplishments to his credit in those areas where
          conditions have permitted him to develop his official activity.</p></item>

       <item>For several years since the end of the war, the Navy and the Air Force have been
        codirecting special electronic airborne search projects in the furtherance of a program of
        obtaining the maximum amount of intelligence concerning foreign electronic developments as a
        safeguard to the national defense. These operations have been carried on without a formal
        statement of policy but on the basis of an informal working agreement between the Navy and
        the Air Force. The information derived from these activities is of the utmost importance
        from both an operational and technical standpoint, and thus far has not been attainable from
        any other source.</item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>As you undoubtedly know, the recent incident in the Baltic,<note n="2" xml:id="d6fn2">A
         U.S. Navy B–24 Privateer aircraft with 10 crewmen abroad was shot down by Soviet planes on
         April 8. The United States protested the Soviet action; see <ref

        plane engaged in a flight connected with this program was lost, resulted in a high-level
        decision, on 17 April 1950, to discontinue further projects of this program for a period of
        thirty days.</item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>It is recognized that there is a risk of repetition of such incidents upon resumption
        of these flights, but it is felt that there would be more serious disadvantages accruing to
        the United States if the cessation of these operations were to be extended over an
        excessively long period.</item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item>Accordingly, the Joint Chiefs of Staff urge that the special electronic airborne search
        projects be resumed with the least practicable delay and that action be initiated at the
        highest governmental level to secure approval therefore. In this connection they have agreed
        upon the policies stated below as a definitive basis of operation when these flights are
        resumed: <list>

        applicable to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 68 and particularly the decision of the
        United States Government to make a major effort in the field of covert operations. The
         <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> charter is not elaborated here since it is assumed that
        those reviewing this paper will be familiar with <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
         10/2<note n="3" xml:id="d8fn3">See <ref target="#d2fn2">footnote 2, Document
         2</ref>.</note> and related documents.</item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>The primary consideration is determination of the scale on which it may be possible to
        carry out covert operations in support of <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0042"/>United
        States foreign policy. In this connection it is apparent that two factors impose ceilings on
        covert operations: <list>
         <label>a.</label>
         <item>The establishment of an organization such as <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> is
          unprecedented in the peacetime history of the United States. Because of this a significant
          body of knowledge, personnel reserves, techniques and philosophy of operations are not
          readily available. The difficulty of locating and inducing physically, intellectually and
          psychologically qualified American personnel to abandon their present activities and
          enlist in the cold war imposes a significant limitation on the capacity to plan and
          conduct covert operations. So long as the nation is technically at peace and manpower
          controls do not exist, recruitment of adequate numbers of personnel with ability to direct
          and execute these activities will be difficult and a fairly heavy attrition rate can be
          foreseen.</item>
         <label>b.</label>
         <item>The second major limiting factor is the requirement that <gloss target="#t_OPC1"
           >OPC</gloss> activities be conducted in such a covert manner that they cannot be traced
          to the United States Government and in the event such activities are so traced, the
          Government shall be in a position plausibly to disavow responsibility. Covert operations
          are increasingly difficult to execute as they increase in size. Even such a relatively
          simple matter as the clandestine disbursement of funds grows difficult as the amounts
          involved increase to millions of dollars. These difficulties pyramid when complex
          activities are undertaken, such as the creation of large resistance organizations or the
          extensive employment of guerrilla units. The problems attendant on security are not
          insurmountable in themselves, but there are definite [limits?] above which it is not safe
          to go without willingness to face exposure which might entail hostile political and
          psychological exploitation.</item>
        </list></item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>A further difficulty inherent in the conduct of clandestine operations on behalf of
        this Government lies in the vast water area and various national borders interposed between
        the United States and its target areas. In contrast to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
         >USSR</gloss> operating from the center of the Eurasian land mass with interior lines of
        communication and dominating all areas between them and their primary targets in Eurasia,
        United States is confronted with major logistical and security problems that are not
        comparable. Even though logistical problems can be resolved the maintenance of adequate
        security in peacetime is a real limiting factor in the conduct of covert operations in
        Eurasia.</item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item>Responsive to the decision of the United States Government to make a major effort in
        the field of covert operations and to provide the basis on which the increased
        responsibilities of <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> may be accomplished, it is assumed
        that adequate administrative and logistical support will be available; specifically, that: <list>

         <label>f.</label>
         <item>In view of the dearth of personnel experienced in covert operations, military and
          foreign service personnel having appropriate qualifications will be made available to
           <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> on a high priority basis.</item>
         <label>g.</label>
         <item>Recognition will be given to the fact that those conducting covert operations are in
          fact the front line troops in the cold war and should be given maximum support with
          administrative flexibility.</item>
        </list></item>
       <label>5.</label>
       <item>Since it is considered that 1954 is the crucial year, the estimates up to and including
        that time must necessarily include expenditures for establishing, stockpiling and operating
        overseas supply bases, the establishment and strengthening of effective organizations to
        direct and execute covert operations in and against each target area, the establishment of
        an adequate, world-wide communications system, and the conduct of extensive training with
        adequate facilities of all types, including paramilitary.</item>
       <label>6.</label>
       <item>A series of independent projections coincide in establishing a figure of [<hi
         rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>] as the maximum American field force that <gloss
         target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> can install and maintain overseas in 1954. This force will be
        disposed largely in Eurasia in considerable depth along the periphery of the Soviet Union.
        Prior to 1954 the primary limitation will be the size and inexperience of our overseas
        stations. However, by 1954 the bulk of the [<hi rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>]
        personnel will have attained a degree of effectiveness which should have a significant
        effect on the cold war. The number of American personnel does not indicate the total size of
        the forces involved in covert operations, which must necessarily be conducted largely
        through apparati utilizing indigenous personnel.</item>
       <label>7.</label>
       <item>The attached data which present estimates of <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>
        financial requirements by target areas as well as operational areas are considered as
        realistic as is possible within the framework of considerations and limitations outlined
        herein. Modifications of these estimates would be required in response to more specific
        policy guidance with respect to emphasis on certain programs or areas. For example, if
        covert economic warfare operations on any considerable scale were subsidized by <gloss
         target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> it would require sums greatly in excess of these estimates.
        Likewise, the share of financial responsibility to be borne by <gloss target="#t_OPC1"
         >OPC</gloss> in connection with certain types of joint operations undertaken with the
        Department of Defense may affect the estimates.</item>
       <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0044"/>
       <label>8.</label>
       <item>As is indicated above, the two major factors limiting the scale of covert operations
        are qualified and trained personnel willing and able to undertake these activities in the
        areas involved and the requirement that the activities be conducted in such a covert manner
        that they cannot be traced to the United States Government. Manpower controls designed to
        channel qualified personnel into the Government service on behalf of the cold war would
        ameliorate the first limitation. Likewise, if the international situation deteriorates
        further, the United States Government may be willing to authorize greater security risks in
        covert operations in order to step up such activities. For example, covert support of
        guerrilla or resistance forces on a large scale would be impossible to accomplish with the
        degree of security required by current United States policy. Should the Government’s policy
        require such support on an enlarged scale with recognition of security factors involved,
        funds greatly in excess of those indicated on the attachment would be required.</item>

      <p>When North Korea invaded South Korea on June 25, 1950, the U.S. intelligence organizations
       had few resources or personnel dedicated to Korean matters. This situation changed quickly,
       with the Central Intelligence Agency and the armed forces’ intelligence services devoting
       massive efforts to support the Korean war effort. The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
       Office of Policy Coordination began an immediate build-up. Its operational concepts were
       based on the Office of Strategic Services’ (<gloss target="#t_OSS1">OSS</gloss>) World War II
       experience and stressed stay-behind agents and guerrilla forces. For the <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>’s intelligence analysis of the early phase of the Korean war,
       see <persName>Woodrow J. Kuhns</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Assessing the Soviet Threat: The
        Early Cold War Years</hi> (Washington: Central Intelligence Agency, 1997).</p>
      <p>After the second capture of Seoul by Communist forces in 1951, guerrilla forces, along with
       commando and reconnaissance raids, received the bulk of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
       attention. Eventually some 3,000 guerrillas were operating in the mountains of North Korea,
       and they briefly succeeded in tying up some North Korean and Chinese troops. The <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> also provided order of battle and targeting intelligence,
       intelligence to enforce the economic embargo against North Korea and China, and daily current
       intelligence publications on the situation in Korea.</p>
      <p>For a time, following the entry of Chinese troops in late November 1950, there was
       widespread concern in the United States that the Korean invasion was the first phase of a
       Soviet-inspired World War III that would soon engulf Europe as well as Asia. Planning began
       to simultaneously provide massive support for anti-Communist guerrillas in China and
       paramilitary activity in Europe. Emergency war plans were drawn up. In this crisis
       atmosphere, the Department of Defense urged the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to begin
       to accelerate many other war-related programs: evasion and escape planning, the build-up of
       supplies, training of para-military <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0046"/>forces, increased
       propaganda, encouragement of Soviet defections, economic defense programs, and the like. This
       led <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss>

      <p>The Central Intelligence Agency’s Office of Policy Coordination sought to make use of
       ostensibly private organizations and businesses in carrying out its cold war covert action
       mandate. The National Committee for Free Europe (<gloss target="#t_NCFE1">NCFE</gloss>) was
       one of the first such organizations, incorporated in 1949. At the instigation of <persName
        corresp="#p_KGF1">George Kennan</persName> of the Policy Planning Staff of the Department of
       State, <gloss target="#t_NCFE1">NCFE</gloss> was created to utilize anti-Communist refugees
       and émigrés to undermine Soviet control of Eastern Europe. In February 1950, the <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> gave <gloss target="#t_NCFE1">NCFE</gloss> a <pb n="18"
        xml:id="pg_18" facs="0047"/>transmitter that was installed in Germany and went on the air as
       Radio Free Europe on July 4, 1950. A host of other organizations also worked with <gloss
        target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>, with more or less independence, in the early cold war years.
       These included the American Committee for Freedom for the Peoples of the <gloss
        target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, the Committee for a Free Asia, the Congress for Cultural
       Freedom, and several youth and student organizations, including the National Student
       Association. One of the earliest Agency proprietary companies was Air America, which long
       provided <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> airlift capability in the Far East. <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> purchased Air America from <persName>Claire

      <p rend="flushleft">My Dear Admiral:</p>
      <p>For some months representatives of the <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> and of the
       Department of Justice have been formulating a plan of action for an emergency situation
       wherein it would be necessary to apprehend and detain persons who are potentially dangerous
       to the internal security of the country. I thought you would be interested in a brief outline
       of the plan.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Action to Be Taken By the Department of Justice</hi></p>
      <p>The plan envisions four types of emergency situations: (1) attack upon the United States;
       (2) threatened invasion; (3) attack upon United States troops in legally occupied territory;
       and (4) rebellion.</p>
      <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19" facs="0048"/>
      <p>The plan contains a prepared document which should be referred to the President immediately
       upon the existence of one of the emergency situations for the President’s signature. Briefly,
       this proclamation recites the existence of the emergency situation and that in order to
       immediately protect the country against treason, espionage and sabotage the Attorney General
       is instructed to apprehend all individuals potentially dangerous to the internal security. In
       order to make effective these apprehensions, the proclamation suspends the Writ of Habeas
       Corpus for apprehensions made pursuant to it.</p>
      <p>The plan also contains a prepared joint resolution to be passed by Congress and an
       Executive Order for the President which too will validate the previous Presidential
       proclamation.</p>
      <p>The next step in the plan is a prepared order from the Attorney General to the Director of
       the <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> to apprehend dangerous individuals, conduct necessary
       searches and seize contraband as defined in the plan. Together with the order to the Director
       of the <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> the Attorney General will forward a master warrant
       attached to a list of names of individuals which names have previously been furnished from
       time to time to the Attorney General by the <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> as being
       individuals who are potentially dangerous to the internal security.</p>
      <p>It should be pointed out that the plan does not distinguish between aliens and citizens and
       both are included in its purview. If for some reason the full plan is not put into operation
       it has so been drawn that the section applicable only to alien enemies may be put into
       effect.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Action to Be Taken By the <gloss target="#t_FBI1"
         >FBI</gloss></hi></p>
      <p>For a long period of time the <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> has been accumulating the
       names, identities and activities of individuals found to be potentially dangerous to the
       internal security through investigation. These names have been compiled in an index which
       index has been kept up to date. The names in this index are the ones that have been furnished
       to the Department of Justice and will be attached to the master warrant referred to above.
       This master warrant will, therefore, serve as legal authority for the <gloss target="#t_FBI1"
        >FBI</gloss> to cause the apprehension and detention of the individuals maintained in this
       index. The index now contains approximately twelve thousand individuals, of which
       approximately ninety-seven per cent are citizens of the United States. Immediately upon
       receipt of instructions and the master warrant from the Attorney General the various <gloss
        target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> Field Divisions will be instructed by expeditious means to
       cause the apprehension of the individuals within their various territories. Each <gloss
        target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> Field Division maintains an index of the individuals within its
       territory, which index is so arranged that it may be used for ready apprehension purposes.
       Upon apprehension the individuals will be delivered to the nearest jail for temporary
       detention and action by the Attorney General.</p>
      <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0049"/>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Detention and Subsequent Procedures</hi></p>
      <p>The permanent detention of these individuals will take place in regularly established
       Federal detention facilities. These facilities have been confidentially surveyed and the
       facilities have been found to be adequate in all areas except in the territory covered by the
        <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss>’s New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco Offices. In
       these three areas arrangements have been perfected with the National Military Establishment
       for the temporary and permanent detention in Military facilities of the individuals
       apprehended.</p>
      <p>The plan calls for a statement of charges to be served on each detainee and a hearing be
       afforded the individual within a specified period. The Hearing Board will consist of three
       members to be appointed by the Attorney General composed of one Judge of the United States or
       State Court and two citizens. The hearing procedure will give the detainee an opportunity to
       know why he is being detained and permit him to introduce material in the nature of evidence
       in his own behalf. The hearing procedure will not be bound by the rules of evidence. The
       Hearing Board may make one of three recommendations, that is; that the individual be
       detained, paroled or released. This action by the Board is subject to review by the Attorney
       General and the Attorney General’s decision on the matter will be final except for appeal to
       the President.</p>
      <p>The details of this plan as set forth in this communication have also been furnished on
       this date to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1">James S. Lay, Jr</persName>., Executive
       Secretary, National Security Council.</p>
      <p>With expressions of my highest esteem and best regards,</p>
      <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

      <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJE1">Webb</persName>:</p>
      <p>The State-Defense Staff Study of 1 May 1950, on “Production of National Intelligence”,
       transmitted with your letter of 7 July<note n="2" xml:id="d20fn2">Not printed. (Ibid.) For
        the staff study, see <ref target="frus1945-50Intel#d420"><hi rend="italic">Foreign
          Relations</hi>, 1945–1950, Emergence of the Intelligence Establishment, Document
        420</ref>. Apparently, however, the staff study sent to <persName corresp="#p_HRAR1"
         >Hillenkoetter</persName> mistakenly included pages from a “preliminary” or “early”
        version; see <ref target="#d22">Document 22</ref>.</note> for my comments, points up the
       conflicting theories which have prevailed since the inception of <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss> on the responsibility within our Government for intelligence relating to the
       national security, i.e., a responsible single Director versus a committee of co-equal
       directors of the several intelligence agencies.</p>
      <p>The proposals set forth in the Staff Study would be so radical a departure from the concept
       of the Central Intelligence Agency as envisaged by the Congress that there exists at present
       no legal authority to adopt them.</p>
      <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0053"/>
      <p>As an indication of this Congressional intent, I quote from the statement of the Chairman
       of the Special Subcommittee of the House Expenditures Committee Investigating Intelligence
       Activities of the Government (at the time of the Bogota crisis) dated 16 April 1948: <quote
        rend="blockquote">
        <p>“It may be necessary for Congress to enact additional legislation to give the <gloss
          target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> the independent status it was generally presumed to enjoy.…
         Our Central Intelligence Agency must be protected against censorship or intimidation by any
         arm of the Executive Branch.”</p>
       </quote></p>
      <p>This position has been repeatedly made clear to me in virtually every committee session I
       have attended since assuming the Directorship. It is also a fact that in times of crisis the
       appropriate Congressional Committees have always called on the Director of Central
       Intelligence for an accounting and for briefing on the intelligence situation. The Congress
       has always made it amply clear in these situations that it holds the Director and this Agency
       completely responsible in the field of foreign intelligence, and it presumes that this Agency
       has the requisite powers and authorities to make that responsibility effective in the
       interests of our national security.</p>
      <p>The effect of your Staff Study is to abrogate the statutory responsibility for the
       production of national intelligence of the Central Intelligence Agency and shift it as a
       collective responsibility to a committee. This is specified in your study as follows: <quote
        rend="blockquote">
        <p>“Until the emergence of a national estimate or study from the <gloss target="#t_IAC1"
          >IAC</gloss>, collective responsibility is inescapable under the Act of 1947 … The full
         statutory responsibility of the D/<gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss> for the production of
         national intelligence becomes operative only when … final drafts of national estimates or
         studies are recommended by the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> to the D/<gloss
          target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss>.”</p>
       </quote></p>
      <p>Not only does the National Security Act contemplate no such doctrine of collective
       responsibility, but, in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 50,<note n="3" xml:id="d20fn3"
        >For text of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 50, see <ref target="frus1945-50Intel#d384"
          ><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1945–1950, Emergence of the Intelligence
         Establishment, Document 384</ref>.</note> the National Security Council specifically
       disavowed this doctrine in the following language: <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“… we do not believe that the Director and the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> should
         be bound by the concept of collective responsibility because this would inevitably reduce
         coordinated national intelligence to the lowest common denominator among the agencies
         concerned.”</p>
       </quote></p>
      <p>Careful thought and study has been given to the existing <gloss target="#t_NSCID1"

       your information.<note n="5" xml:id="d20fn5">Not found.</note> This draft clearly establishes
       the minimum authorities necessary to enable this Agency to fulfill its statutory
       responsibilities and likewise establishes the responsibilities of the departmental agencies
       in support of national intelligence. Separate specific comments on your Staff Study are also
        attached.<note n="6" xml:id="d20fn6">A 7-page paper, July 25, signed by <persName

      <p>It is noted that you propose to submit your Staff Study with its proposed <gloss
        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Directive direct to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>. It
       is therefore requested that our comments and the inclosure accompany your submission.</p>
      <p>As a matter of parallel interest the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has been
       instructed by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> to consider through normal <gloss
        target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss> procedure the following quoted comments of the Secretary of
       Defense, and to submit recommendations in connection therewith: <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“I do not find the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> comments on RECOMMENDATION 8 to be
         convincing. Existing directives fall far short of coming to grips with urgent and
         recognizable problems of coordination of intelligence in Washington and overseas.
         Furthermore, I do not concede that the ‘rather elaborate committee structure’ is either
         inevitable or desirable. On the contrary, it is my belief that the intricate committee
         structure is the consequence of compromises created by inter-bureau rivalries rather than
         the results of objective study of intelligence organization.</p>
        <p>Dependable conclusions from … intelligence, as from every other subject matter of
         national intelligence, should result from evaluation and synthesis within the framework of
         the Central Agency of all available material from every Federal source. Final
         responsibility for coordinating the collection of this material as well as its processing
         should rest squarely in the same agency. With that responsibility should go corresponding
         authority, which now is ambiguous and obscured in the present interlocking committee
         structure.”</p>
       </quote></p>
      <p>In view of our instructions from the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> in connection with
       this statement, it would in any case be incumbent on this Agency to submit our proposed
       revision of the <gloss target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss> through normal channels as it
       reflects our considered opinion of what is needed as a proper foundation for the national
       intelligence mission.</p>

       <item>Expanded Requirements of the Armed Forces Security Agency (<gloss target="#t_AFSA1"
         >AFSA</gloss>) in View of Current World Situation</item>
      </list>
      <p>1. By a memorandum dated 22 June 1950<note n="2" xml:id="d21fn2">Not found.</note> the
       Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended to you that funds be made available to permit commencing
       immediate recruiting of additional civilian personnel by the Armed Forces Security Agency
        (<gloss target="#t_AFSA1">AFSA</gloss>), in order to increase that Agency’s output of
       communications intelligence. The Director, <gloss target="#t_AFSA1">AFSA</gloss>, was
       thereafter authorized by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) to commence
       recruiting, with ultimate ceiling to be determined later.</p>
      <p>2. In the light of the current world situation, as it has developed since 22 June, the
       necessity for a large increase in output of communications intelligence has taken an added
       degree of urgency. In addition, the same developments have generated an additional need for
       greatly expedited production of cryptographic material required by the armed forces, and for
       stepped-up prosecution of already approved research and development projects in both the
       communications intelligence and communication security fields.</p>
      <p>3. The Joint Chiefs of Staff, after careful study of the needs involved, recommend as a
       matter of urgency that the current direct resources of <gloss target="#t_AFSA1">AFSA</gloss>
       be increased as follows (these increases include the additional personnel recommended in the
       above mentioned memorandum of 22 June 1950):</p>

      <p>I regret to report the discovery that the staff study enclosed with your letter of July 7
       to <persName corresp="#p_HRAR1">Admiral Hillenkoetter</persName> on this subject<note n="3"
        xml:id="d22fn3">Regarding <persName corresp="#p_WJE1">Webb</persName>’s July 7 letter, see
         <ref target="#d20fn2">footnote 2, Document 20</ref>. The enclosed “preliminary” or “early”
        version of the State–Defense staff study has not been found.</note> was in fact a
       preliminary version containing three pages which were later amended. While the final version
       of the paper is not fundamentally different, the fact is that only the early version
       contained the reference to “collective responsibility”—to which <persName corresp="#p_HRAR1"
        >Hillenkoetter</persName> took strong exception and on which he pinned much of his
        argument.<note n="4" xml:id="d22fn4">See <ref target="#d20">Document 20</ref>.</note></p>
      <p>This error, for which I am fully responsible, appears to have come about through the
       circumstance that the paper was amended in the interval between the time it was first
       presented to you (May 2) and the time when you considered it for the second time and
       forwarded it to <persName corresp="#p_HRAR1">Hillenkoetter</persName> (July 7). The amended
       pages were not substituted in the copies in your office, one of which apparently was
       transmitted to <persName corresp="#p_HRAR1">Hillenkoetter</persName>.</p>
      <p>While we feel sure that the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> reaction to either version
       of the paper would have been substantially the same, we must of course set the record
       straight by transmitting the final version of the paper on which there was State-Defense
       agreement. At the same time, there is the chance, however faint, that if <persName
        corresp="#p_HRAR1">Hillenkoetter</persName> has any inclination to modify his original and
       extreme position, forwarding of the later version will provide him with a convenient excuse
       for doing so.</p>
      <p>In this connection, <persName corresp="#p_MBGJUSA1">General Magruder</persName> and Admiral
        <persName>Souers</persName> yesterday discussed the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
       reaction to our proposals. According to <persName corresp="#p_MBGJUSA1">Magruder</persName>,
       it is <persName>Souers</persName>’s view that <persName corresp="#p_HRAR1"
        >Hillenkoetter</persName>’s position is wrong, that an effort should be made to make him see
       the constructive features of our proposals, and that the later version of the paper may
       provide him with a convenient “out.” To this end, <persName>Souers</persName> has suggested
       that he <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0058"/>himself call <persName corresp="#p_HRAR1"
        >Hillenkoetter</persName> and urge him to set up a meeting where <persName
        corresp="#p_MBGJUSA1">Magruder</persName> could go over the paper with <persName
        corresp="#p_HRAR1">Hillenkoetter</persName> and his principal assistants.</p>
      <p>Before that meeting, however, it will be important that we get to <persName
        corresp="#p_HRAR1">Hillenkoetter</persName> the correct final version of the paper. The
       simplest and best way of accomplishing this would be for you to telephone <persName
        corresp="#p_HRAR1">Admiral Hillenkoetter</persName>, inform him of the mistake and tell him
       that you are sending over the correct version of the paper. At the same time, you should
       mention that you understand that <persName corresp="#p_MBGJUSA1">General Magruder</persName>
       will be discussing the subject of national intelligence with him.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Recommendation:</hi></p>
      <p>That you telephone <persName corresp="#p_HRAR1">Admiral Hillenkoetter</persName> along the

       from existing National Security Council directives which impose upon <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss> the board of directors mechanism of the Intelligence Advisory Committee (<gloss
        target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss>) in the following manner: <list>
        <label>a.</label>
        <item>They require that recommendations and advice of the Director of Central Intelligence
          (<gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss>) to the National Security Council (<gloss

        <label>b.</label>
        <item>They enable the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> to assert the position that they
         are not merely advisory to the <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss>, but are actually a
         board of directors, of which the <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> is but the executive
         secretary, i.e. one among equals;</item>
        <label>c.</label>
        <item>Therefore the recommendations which go forward to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
          >NSC</gloss> are not <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> recommendations as contemplated

       <label>d.</label>
       <item>Difficulties imposed by <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> directives in the field of

       <label>e.</label>
       <item>There is a failure of coordination of overt intelligence collection in the field, due

       <item>Review of Relations with <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss></item>
      </list>
      <p>The purpose of this review is twofold: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>To give you a general roundup of the state of our relations with the <gloss
          target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> at this juncture, as a new Director is coming in;</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>To ascertain which, if any, issues should be discussed with <persName
          corresp="#p_HRAR1">Admiral Hillenkoetter</persName> as a result of your letter,<note n="2"
          xml:id="d24fn2">Not found.</note> written just prior to your departure for Europe, in
         which you suggested getting together with him to take up any problems which exist in
         relation to one particular phase of the Department’s relations with <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
          >CIA</gloss>, namely, secret intelligence [<hi rend="italic">1 line not
         declassified</hi>].</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>Any review such as this naturally focuses on areas of difficulty; these, however, must be
       kept in the perspective of our total relations which in a great number of areas are on the
       whole satisfactory. In this connection it should be pointed out that the Department’s
       relations with <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> on the following important matters are of
       the best: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item><hi rend="italic">Defectors</hi>—each case invariably presents a knotty problem, but
         in the course of the last six months they have been smoothly and cooperatively dealt with
         by the Department, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, and the Military Services.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item><hi rend="italic">Foreign Broadcast Monitoring</hi>—an important “service of common
         concern” in which <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> produces for the Department and other
         agencies a vast quantity of voice monitoring reports.</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item><hi rend="italic">Scientific Intelligence</hi>—A “service of common concern” and also
         a coordinating mechanism in which <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>’s performance has
         been good. This office also works very closely with U/A, Mr.
         <persName>Arneson</persName>.</item>
        <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0063"/>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item><hi rend="italic">Contacts Branch</hi>—again a “service of common concern” in which
          <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> exploits the foreign intelligence available in the US
         through contacts with foreign nationality groups and individuals and US business firms with
         representatives abroad.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>I should point out also that whereas the problems which I shall discuss below are focused
       primarily in <gloss target="#t_OSO1">OSO</gloss> (secret intelligence) and <gloss
        target="#t_ORE1">ORE</gloss> (research intelligence) it should not be construed that trouble
       exists with these offices on all points. Rather, there is a wide area of cooperative effort
       and useful collaboration and liaison with only a few, if significant, areas of disagreement
       on policy or method.</p>
      <p>By way of general comment I would like to indicate that there are two factors in <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> attitude and method which we find difficult to deal with and
       which are often a source of misunderstanding: <list>
        <label>a.</label>
        <item><gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is reluctant to give us full
         information—especially voluntarily, but even after request. This applies to some
         intelligence information and also to activities in which they participate. In this it is
         our view that they carry security too far, or use security as an excuse for withholding
         information.</item>
        <label>b.</label>
        <item>Similarly, we find <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> reluctant to come to us
         directly with their problems, to identify issues and seek solutions directly. We get
         complaints, but we find an unhealthy lack of direct approach to us by senior officers
         seeking constructive solutions to problems large and small which inevitably arise.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>The following outline summarizes the points of difficulty, present and potential, in our
       relations with <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">I. Coordination of Intelligence Activities.</hi></p>
      <p>The Department has long felt that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has been deficient in
       fulfilling its responsibilities for leadership and direction in the coordination of
       intelligence throughout the Government. This responsibility within <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss> is fulfilled essentially by two mechanisms: <list>
        <label>a.</label>
        <item>The Intelligence Advisory Committee (<gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss>) composed of
         the Chiefs of each of the intelligence services, advisory to the Director.</item>
        <label>b.</label>
        <item>A staff office (<gloss target="#t_COAPS1">COAPS</gloss>) composed of officers
         contributed by the various agencies and headed by a State Department officer, responsible
         to the Director and charged with formulating any procedures for the coordination of
         intelligence activities.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>The Department is confident that change for the better can be anticipated not only by
       virtue of the new Director who will assume the chairmanship of the <gloss target="#t_IAC1"
        >IAC</gloss> and should fulfill the leadership expected of the Director of <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> in coordination matters, but also through the appointment of
        <persName corresp="#p_RJQ1">James Q. Reber</persName> as the State Department officer in
       charge of <gloss target="#t_COAPS1">COAPS</gloss>, who will also be Executive Secretary of
       the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss>.</p>
      <p>I believe that no useful purpose would be served by discussion of this matter with the
       outgoing Director.</p>
      <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0064"/>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">II. Intelligence Collection Programs.</hi></p>
      <p>This problem, which has very wide implications and is pointed up by the Korean incident, is
       discussed in a separate, accompanying memorandum.<note n="3" xml:id="d24fn3">Dated September
        14; attached but not printed.</note></p>
      <p>No useful purpose would be served by a discussion of the matter at this time with the
       Director.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">III. Research Intelligence and “National
        Intelligence.”</hi></p>
      <p>The difficulties which have arisen between the Department and <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss> in this area stem from divergence of views as to the nature of “national
       intelligence” and the method of producing it on the one hand, and, on the other, a conflict
       of ideas on the location of responsibility in the Department and <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss> for the production of research intelligence in the political and economic
       fields. The latter of these two problems is perennial and may in some measure be clarified
       with a solution to the problem of national intelligence. In any event, the steps necessary to
       bring this problem to a solution will only come in time and should be improved with the
       arrival of the new Director.</p>
      <p>Some advance has been made in the problem of “national intelligence” which was sharpened by
       your exchange of <persName corresp="#p_HRAR1">Admiral Hillenkoetter</persName> on the joint
       State-Defense proposal. <persName corresp="#p_MBGJUSA1">General Magruder</persName> has made
       a preliminary exploration with <persName corresp="#p_HRAR1">Admiral Hillenkoetter</persName>
       and believes that an area of agreement may be possible.</p>
      <p>Pending the outcome of these negotiations and the installation of the new Director on whose
       decision any final revision will depend, I believe no useful purpose would be served in
       raising this matter with <persName corresp="#p_HRAR1">Admiral Hillenkoetter</persName>.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">IV. Organization for Secret Intelligence (<gloss
         target="#t_OSO1">OSO</gloss>) and Secret Operations (<gloss target="#t_OPC1"
        >OPC</gloss>).</hi></p>
      <p>You will remember that some months ago general agreement was reached between the Department
       of Defense, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_OSO1">OSO</gloss>, <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>, and ourselves on a

       Further action on this document, however, was delayed pending a solution to the problem of

      <p>No useful purpose, therefore, would be served by discussions on this matter with <persName

        xml:id="pg_36" facs="0065"/>that although there is no disagreement as between the
       Departments of State and Defense and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> on this question,
       the Defense Department is currently considering a revision of authorities for wartime with
       respect both to <gloss target="#t_OSO1">OSO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>
       activities, and this may present some difficulties.</p>

      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">VI. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Budget.</hi></p>
      <p>Each year the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> submits an over-all budget figure to the
        <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> prior to submission to the Bureau of the Budget. It
       appears that over the course of the last few years no agency—neither the <gloss
        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> nor the Budget Bureau nor the Office of the President, nor, for
       that matter, Congressional committees—examines the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> budget
       with any thoroughness to warrant assumption of the responsibility for approval.</p>
      <p>At best it is a very difficult matter to determine what degree of review should be made of
       the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> budget to bring about a balance between the security
       factors which are obviously involved on the one hand, and the minimum requirements for
       assumption of responsibility by the Secretaries of State and Defense in the <gloss
        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>, on the other.</p>
      <p>Last year at your suggestion <persName corresp="#p_MBGJUSA1">General Magruder</persName>
       and <persName>Halaby</persName> for Defense, and <persName>Sheppard</persName> and <persName
        corresp="#p_HF1">Howe</persName> for the State Department, were given an informal
       presentation of the budget programs for some of the offices of <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss>. This was an initial step on the part of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
        >NSC</gloss> to form a basis for judgment for approval of the budget. Since that time an
       effort has been made by the Departments of State and Defense to arrive at a formula for an
       annual review of the budget. Consideration was given, for instance, to the possibility of
       appointing each year a special ad hoc high level group under the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
        >NSC</gloss> for this specific purpose. More acceptable seems the possibility that the
       Director submit to the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> on a secure basis for its comment
       the budget programs of the several <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> offices so that the
        <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> would at least have the benefit of the <gloss
        target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> advice.</p>
      <p>This problem has advanced no further and almost surely should await the installation of the
       new Director and a new look at the problem with him. (As yet no discussions on this subject
       have been held with <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> itself.) In the meantime, no purpose
       would seem to be served in a discussion of the problem with <persName corresp="#p_HRAR1"

       <label>1.</label>
       <item>Psychological warfare policy guidance for <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>
        activities was received from two principal sources during the past quarter. Much of this
        guidance came from the <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> Consultants, while some was
        received from the National Psychological Strategy Board (formerly the Interdepartmental
        Foreign Information Organization, on which <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> functioned in
        consultant status).</item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>From the <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> Consultants, the following guidance was
        given <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> in matters of Psychological Warfare: <list>
         <label>a.</label>
         <item>At the meeting of 9 August 1950, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JRP1">Joyce</persName>
          (State) agreed with the opinion that <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> should no longer
          engage in [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] motion pictures. He
          stated that this should be treated as an overt matter and that such matters would be
          handled elsewhere.</item>
         <label>b.</label>
         <item>On the same date, it was agreed that any possible use of propaganda balloons [<hi
           rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] should not be publicized.</item>
         <pb n="39" xml:id="pg_39" facs="0068"/>
         <label>c.</label>
         <item>On 23 August 1950, the consultants agreed that there was no objection on policy
          grounds to <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> proposals for the use of balloons from time
          to time [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>].</item>
         <label>d.</label>
         <item>At the meeting of 13 September 1950, <persName corresp="#p_SVARLC1">Admiral
           Stevens</persName> (<gloss target="#t_JSPD1">JSPD</gloss>) cautioned against any attempt
          to use Navy vessels as cover for [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
          declassified</hi>] psychological warfare operations. He stated that the Navy could furnish
          technical advice as to the feasibility of water-borne operations but that no warships
          would be made available for this purpose.</item>
         <label>e.</label>
         <item>On 20 September 1950 the consultants stated that in planning and executing covert
          psychological warfare operations <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> should consider
          decisions of the National Psychological Strategy Board as constituting governing
          policy.</item>
         <label>f.</label>
         <item>Again on 20 September, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCEJ1">Hulick</persName> (<gloss
           target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>) referred to a recent decision of the National Psychological
          Strategy Board to the effect that balloons other than those of the toy variety would not
          be used for overt or covert propaganda against Iron Curtain countries without prior
          specific permission from the Board. Such a medium will be reserved for a particularly
          important message. It was stated that this policy is by no means irrevocable and that
          proposals for <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> action in this field would be considered
          on their merits.</item>
        </list></item>

       <item>Guidance received from the National Psychological Strategy Board: <list>
         <label>a.</label>
         <item>On 14 July 1950, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEW1">Barrett</persName> (State) announced
          the formation of an ad hoc coordinating group composed of State, Army, Navy, Air Force,
          and <gloss target="#t_JSPD1">JSPD</gloss> members, chaired by Mr. <persName
           corresp="#p_JP1">Jos. Phillips</persName>, State. This group was to coordinate
          information policy guidance in connection with the Korean situation. <gloss
           target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> made arrangements to have a member present at the ad hoc
          meetings, and overt guidance discussed therein was turned later into general materials for
           <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> Area Divisions. Guidance received at meetings for
          this inter-service group was indirect and irregular, and only used when appropriate to
           <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> methods and channels.</item>
         <label>b.</label>
         <item>At the same meeting of 14 July, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFG1">Wisner</persName>
           (<gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>) referred to a decision, approved by the Department
          of State, to permit the National Committee for Free Europe to use certain material
          attributing responsibility of the Korean situation to the Soviets.</item>
         <label>c.</label>
         <item>On Tuesday, 15 August 1950, the Board discussed attempts to defeat the admission of
          Communist China to the Security Council. The Board felt that [<hi rend="italic">less than
           1 line not declassified</hi>] propaganda identifying Communist China participation in the
          Korean situation might be extremely effective in certain limited areas. Mr. <persName
           corresp="#p_JP1">Phillips</persName> (State) referred to a suggestion that we might give
          circulation to reports or rumors that the Soviets did not actually want to seat the
          Chinese Communists in the UN. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEW1">Barrett</persName> (State)
          saw no objection to this on policy <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0069"/>grounds and
          undertook to review the policy question of limited covert use.</item>
         <label>d.</label>
         <item>On 21 August 1950, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEW1">Barrett</persName> (State)
          reported the recommendations of his department on identification of Chinese Communist
          participation in the Korean war. Such action was approved. (See entry above.)</item>
         <label>e.</label>
         <item>At a special meeting of 13 September 1950, it was decided by the Board that the use
          of balloons as a propaganda carrying medium against the Iron Curtain countries would not
          at that time achieve any important advantage; the potential value of balloons was decided
          to have been sufficiently established to justify the further development and stockpiling
          of balloons for use in an emergency or in time of war. <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>
          was given the responsibility of doing so.</item>
         <label>f.</label>
         <item>The [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] was discussed on 18
          September 1950, and <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">Gen. Magruder</persName> (Defense)
          expressed the need for handout materials explaining [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
           not declassified</hi>] to the public.</item>
         <label>g.</label>
         <item>At the meeting of 25 September 1950, Mr. [<hi rend="italic">name not
           declassified</hi>] (<gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>) was asked to comment on the
          progress of the balloon project, and in doing so Mr.[<hi rend="italic">name not
           declassified</hi>] requested authorization to coordinate with <gloss target="#t_ONR1"
           >ONR</gloss> on research, which was agreed to. A uniform reply to private inquiries re
          government use of balloons was agreed to: “The matter is under continuous study by
          agencies of the government, but disclosure of results at this time would not be in the
          public interest.” The Board decided that utilization of large balloons would only be
          desirable on extraordinary basis to seek to reach large numbers behind the Curtain with
          important messages. The right of decision to use them was held by the NPSB. The Board
          further indicated at this time that any use of balloons for propaganda purposes, whether
          large or small (toy variety) would be a matter falling under its jurisdiction, and that
          such uses should be for Board decision. In view of the present situation, <gloss
           target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> was admonished to procure balloons for these purposes
          simultaneously with the fostering of training of personnel, additional research and
          experimentation. [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines not declassified</hi>]</item>

      <p>With the outbreak of hostilities in Korea, the Secretary of State took immediate steps to

      <p>In order to meet the requirements of further situations in which joint political and

       action to strengthen the existing organization under <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
       59/1.</p>
      <p>With the concurrence of the Interdepartmental Foreign Information Organization, the
       Department of State on August 16, announced the establishment of a national psychological
       strategy board to carry <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0075"/>out the functions assigned to
       the present Organization as established under <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 59/1.<note
        n="4" xml:id="d28fn4">Reference is to the National Psychological Strategy Board; see <ref

        on April 4, 1951 (see <ref target="#d60">Document 60</ref>), the National Psychological
        Strategy Board was redesignated the Psychological Operations Coordinating Committee.</note>
       Instead of serving simply as policy consultants, the representatives of the Secretary of
       Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of Central Intelligence are meeting
       regularly each week as members of the Board with the Assistant Secretary of State for Public
       Affairs as Chairman. Liaison representatives from the National Security Resources Board and
       the Economic Cooperation Administration are also meeting with the Board. A liaison
       representative from the Central Intelligence Agency will be available to attend Board
       meetings as required for intelligence matters. In addition to the responsibilities laid down
       in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 59/1, the Secretary of State is looking to the Board
       for concrete advice on both policy and operating problems in current situations where joint
       political and military action is required in the psychological warfare field.</p>
      <p>The Board has taken action on a report forwarded by the Interdepartmental Foreign
       Information Staff (<gloss target="#t_IFIS1">IFIS</gloss>) on August 16, recommending adequate
       research and development on balloons for possible use as an alternative means of reaching the
       Soviet Union in the event of war or in the absence of diplomatic relations. The Central
       Intelligence Agency has been requested to arrange for the development and stocking of
       suitable types of balloons for possible use in emergency or war.</p>
      <p>Other <gloss target="#t_IFIS1">IFIS</gloss> reports considered by the Organization include
       one on training of personnel for psychological warfare and foreign information.</p>
      <p>The report prepared by the Organization on a Plan for Psychological Warfare was transmitted

       brief résumé of some of the problems affecting the Central Intelligence Agency which were
       deemed of interest to the members of the Intelligence Advisory Committee. He referred
       specifically to certain drafts of proposed <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> directives,
       which were under discussion at the time <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>
       took over the duties of Director of Central Intelligence between representatives of the
       Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of State and the Department of Defense. In
       general, the drafts under discussion were designed to implement <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
        >NSC</gloss> 50.<note n="2" xml:id="d29fn2">For text of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
        50, see <ref target="frus1945-50Intel#d384"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>,
         1945–1950, Emergence of the Intelligence Establishment, Document 384</ref>.</note> By
       agreement of the Director of <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0077"/>Central Intelligence, the
       Department of State and Department of Defense, further consideration of these drafts was
       terminated on the basis of <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>’s assurance
       that <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 50 constituted a sufficient directive at the present
       time. <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> stated that <gloss
        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 50, giving effect in substance to the recommendations of the
       so-called <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> Committee Report, had not yet been
       carried out by the Central Intelligence Agency but that it was his intention promptly to
       carry out this directive except in one respect.</p>
      <p>3. The exception related to the merger of the Office of Special Operations, the Office of
       Policy Coordination, and the Contact Branch of the Office of Operations. This merger was
       considered neither practical nor advisable at this time. <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General
        Smith</persName> said he believed the coordination of these offices, as recommended by the
        <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> Report and incorporated in the directive from
       the National Security Council, could be achieved by more effective cooperation without actual
       merger. <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>’s position in regard to this
       aspect of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 50 had been made clear to the National Security
       Council at its meeting on 12 October 1950 and had been approved by the Council.<note n="3"

      <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> also stated that he had

       as to the position of the Office of Policy Coordination in relation to the Central
       Intelligence Agency and to <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>’s guidance from the Department
       of State and the Department of Defense. <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>
       said that he construed <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2,<note n="4" xml:id="d29fn4"
        >See <ref target="frus1945-50Intel#d292"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>,
         1945–1950, Emergence of the Intelligence Establishment, Document 292</ref>.</note> though
       somewhat ambiguous, as giving clear responsibility and authority to the Director of Central
       Intelligence for the activities of the Office of Policy Coordination. He said that guidance
       from the Department of State and the Department of Defense was essential for the success of
       these operations and that, as a matter of procedure, he was willing that such guidance be
       given by representatives of the Department of State and the Department of Defense directly to
       Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFG1">Wisner</persName>. However, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFG1"
        >Wisner</persName> would act under the authority and subject to the control of the Director
       of Central Intelligence, who, under <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2, was responsible
       for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFG1">Wisner</persName>’s operations.</p>

        >William H. Jackson</persName>, Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, as follows:<note
        n="5" xml:id="d29fn5">The full text of <persName corresp="#p_JWH1">Jackson</persName>’s

      <p>The Responsibility of the Central Intelligence Agency for National Intelligence
       Estimates.</p>
      <p>One of the principal duties assigned to the Central Intelligence Agency “for the purpose of
       coordinating the intelligence activities of the several Government departments and agencies
       in the interest of national security” is “to correlate and evaluate intelligence relating to
       the national security, and provide for its appropriate dissemination.” The Central
       Intelligence Agency is thus given the responsibility of seeing to it that the United States
       has adequate central machinery for the examination and interpretation of intelligence so that
       the national security will not be jeopardized by failure to coordinate the best intelligence
       opinion in the country, based on all available information.</p>
      <p>Although the Act<note n="6" xml:id="d29fn6">Reference is to the National Security Act of
        1947 (P.L. 80–253), enacted July 26, 1947; 61 Stat. 495–510.</note> provides that “the
       departments and other agencies of the Government shall continue to collect, evaluate,
       correlate, and disseminate departmental intelligence,” the statute does not limit the duties
       of the Central Intelligence Agency to correlate and evaluate intelligence, except by the
       standard of “national security.”</p>
      <p>The purport of the National Security Act can be understood and justified in the light of
       the history and general objectives of the Act. Behind the concept of a Central Intelligence
       Agency lay the necessity not only for the coordination of diversified intelligence
       activities, and for the performance by the central agency itself of certain services of
       common usefulness, but also for the coordination of intelligence opinion in the form of
       reports or estimates affecting generally the national security as a whole.</p>
      <p>The Act apparently gives the Central Intelligence Agency the independent right of producing
       national intelligence. As a practical matter, such estimates can be written only with the
       collaboration of experts in many fields of intelligence and with the cooperation of several
       departments and agencies of the Government. A national intelligence report or estimate as
       assembled and produced by the Central Intelligence <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0079"
       />Agency should reflect the coordination of the best intelligence opinion, based on all
       available information. It should deal with topics of wide scope relevant to the determination
       of basic policy, such as the assessment of a country’s war potential, its preparedness for
       war, its strategic capabilities and intentions, its vulnerability to various forms of direct
       attack or indirect pressures. An intelligence estimate of such scope would go beyond the
       competence of any single Department or Agency of the Government. A major objective, then, in
       establishing the Central Intelligence Agency was to provide the administrative machinery for
       the coordination of intelligence opinion, for its assembly and review, objectively and
       impartially, and for its expression in the form of estimates of national scope and
       importance.</p>
      <p>The concept of national intelligence estimates underlying the statute is that of an
       authoritative interpretation and appraisal that will serve as a firm guide to policy-makers
       and planners. A national intelligence estimate should reflect the coordination of the best
       intelligence opinion, with notation of and reasons for dissent in the instances when there is
       not unanimity. It should be based on all available information and be prepared with full
       knowledge of our own plans and in the light of our own policy requirements. The estimate
       should be compiled and assembled centrally by an agency whose objectivity and
       disinterestedness are not open to question. Its ultimate approval should rest upon the
       collective judgment of the highest officials in the various intelligence agencies. Finally,
       it should command recognition and respect throughout the Government as the best available and
       presumably the most authoritative intelligence estimate.</p>
      <p>Although the task is made more difficult by a lack of general acceptance of the concept of
       national intelligence estimates in the Government, it is, nevertheless, the clear duty and
       responsibility of the Central Intelligence Agency under the statute to assemble and produce
       such coordinated and authoritative estimates.</p>
      <p>7. There followed a discussion of the above excerpt from the memorandum and there was
       general assent at the meeting to its statement of the responsibility of the Central
       Intelligence Agency for national intelligence estimates. <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General
        Smith</persName> stated that, in order to discharge this responsibility, he proposed at the
       earliest possible time to set up in the Central Intelligence Agency an Office of National
       Estimates. This division, in his opinion, would become the heart of the Central Intelligence
       Agency and of the national intelligence machinery. Services of common concern, now performed
       in the present Office of Reports and Estimates but not including the production of political
       intelligence, would be placed in a separate office or division which might properly be called
       the Office of Research and Reports. The latter would confine its activities to the production
       of reports as a service of common concern in fields assigned specifically by directives of
       the National Security <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0080"/>Council. It was pointed out by
       Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JWH1">Jackson</persName> that the fact that the Office of Reports
       and Estimates has in the past produced both national estimates and miscellaneous reports in
       various fields, which could not possibly be construed as national estimates, had blurred and
       confused both the product and function of the Office of Reports and Estimates. There has been
       insufficient differentiation between the form and the coordination procedure in connection
       with the two products and in their methods of production.</p>
      <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> said that, as to the matter of
       form, in the future intelligence estimates produced by the Central Intelligence Agency on the
       basis of intelligence contributions from the various intelligence agencies and concurred in
       or dissented from by the respective agencies would be published under a cover showing plainly
       that the estimate was a collective effort the result of which would be labeled as a national
       intelligence estimate.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Action</hi></p>
      <p>9. After discussion the following procedural steps were agreed upon in the production of
       national estimates: <list>
        <label>a.</label>
        <item>The Intelligence Advisory Committee will adopt an intelligence plan, or more
         specifically, a list of required national estimates in an order of priority.</item>
        <label>b.</label>
        <item>In the case of a particular estimate, a frame of reference and the assumptions on
         which the estimate is based will be discussed and approved by the Intelligence Advisory
         Committee.</item>
        <label>c.</label>
        <item>Work on the estimate will be referred in the first instance to the Office of Reports
         and Estimates, or to the Office of National Estimates when it is established in the Central
         Intelligence Agency, and the several intelligence agencies will be consulted and a
         time-table fixed for contributions to the national estimate within the fields of their
         respective interests.</item>
        <label>d.</label>
        <item>On the basis of these contributions, the Central Intelligence Agency will produce a
         first draft of the proposed national estimate.</item>
        <label>e.</label>
        <item>This draft will be sent back to the agencies for comment and modification and for
         further discussion if required. On the basis of such comments and discussion, the Central
         Intelligence Agency will produce a second draft of the estimate.</item>
        <label>f.</label>
        <item>This second, or later drafts if required, will be submitted to the Intelligence
         Advisory Committee for final discussion, resolution of differences and approval.</item>
        <label>g.</label>
        <item>If differences cannot be resolved and approval obtained, the estimate will be
         published with notation of substantial dissent and reasons therefor.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>It was made clear by <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> that this
       procedure would not and could not be followed in the case of so-called “crisis estimates.” In
       the event of need arising for a quick or crisis estimate, a procedure similar to that used in
       the recent instance when the President called for a series of estimates prior to his
       departure for the meeting with General <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0081"/><persName

      <p>10. It was determined that at the next meeting of the Intelligence Advisory Committee there
       would be discussion of national estimates priorities and the frame of references and
       assumptions to form the basis of an intelligence estimate of the situation in Indo-China. It
       was also agreed that at a future date <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>
       will produce a paper for submission to the Intelligence Advisory Committee indicating how the
       Central Intelligence Agency will function in the theater of operation in time of war. The

      <pb n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0082"/>
      <p>For the 1950–51 year representatives of State and Defense did review in a cursory fashion

        which I proceeded to do by giving a brief but general chronological account of the origin
        and development of our dealings with <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss>, together with
        three or four illustrations of the activities in which we have been jointly engaged. At the
        conclusion of this résumé I emphasized our concern on the score of security breaches and
        operational and other improprieties as regards the use of counterpart funds. After giving a
        number of illustrations of these unhappy developments and after referring to several of the
        points made by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> in his most recent
        conversations with me, I stated that it seemed to me that there had been two chief types of
        insecurity and that there were two methods which should be employed in order to clear up as
        much of the difficulty as possible.</item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>The two types of action which had given us concern and which promise to create much
        more serious problems for all who are involved unless they can be brought to an end are (a)
        loosetalk, i.e., the tendency on the part of certain <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss>
        labor and public relations people to talk about matters which were none of their concern and
        with unauthorized people; and (b) clumsy and dangerously insecure attempts on the part of
         <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> labor and public relations officials [<hi rend="italic"
         >less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]. I acknowledged that we might not have been
        entirely without fault ourselves and I said that we had taken a number of steps to tighten
        up within our own organization, but I said that it seemed that action was in order on the
        part of Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_FWC1">Foster</persName> and <persName
         corresp="#p_BRMJ1">Bissell</persName> to clear up the difficulties within <gloss

       <item>There were some very favorable comments made about the progress of our [<hi
         rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] operations and all agreed that there
        was not only success here but immeasurable success in terms of evident results. The
        situation as regards [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] operations
        was acknowledged to be by no means as clear. When called upon for an explanation of this, I
        said that the principal problem arose from the fact that the leadership of the [<hi
         rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] has been weak and vacillating and
        that it has not been possible to press them as far as the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
         line not declassified</hi>] have gone. I further said that our approach had been more along
        the lines of building up the younger and more vigorous elements [<hi rend="italic">less than
         1 line not declassified</hi>] and providing them with encouragement, guidance and funds for
        specific projects. <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> commented that we
        should continue along this line especially that of building up vigorous younger elements—but
        that we should take our own independent soundings on the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
         not declassified</hi>] situation at a very early date with a view to reappraising the
        possibilities and reevaluating our efforts to date. It might be that we have been too soft
        about the old leadership and that we should undertake more stringent measures to move aside
        this leadership in order to make way for the other and better elements. Mr. <persName
         corresp="#p_BRMJ1">Bissell</persName> raised a question about the [<hi rend="italic">less
         than 1 line not declassified</hi>] and <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General

        that they should be looked at again.</item>

      <p>In the overall planning for our national security, an adequate and timely intelligence

        <item>Provide additional warnings at least 12 to 48 hours prior to the initiation of

       to come. However, they do provide a clear-cut target toward which your agency and the
       Department of Defense should point their intelligence efforts.</p>
      <p>Satisfaction of these requirements necessitates detailed, comprehensive and continuing
       knowledge of the disposition, organization and state of readiness of the Soviet Armed Forces
       and the supporting economy. The current basis of estimates concerning the Soviet armed forces
       seems dangerously inadequate.</p>
      <p>Because of the extraordinary security program of the Soviet Union virtually no intelligence
       contribution to these requirements is available through normal channels available to Service
       intelligence agencies.</p>
      <p>In view of the basic requirement to prevent strategic and tactical surprise, our limited
       capability to meet this requirement and the potential for improvement of this capability
       through operations by the Central Intelligence Agency within the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
        >USSR</gloss> and the satellites, particularly in the covert and defector fields, the
       Department of Defense is prepared to place support of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
       operations in these fields in Priority One.</p>
      <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0086"/>
      <p>In view of the foregoing, a statement of your foreseeable quantitative and qualitative
       requirements in as much detail as possible is requested in order to enable the Department of
       Defense to arrange for this support.</p>
      <p>With special reference to the matter of military equipment it is further requested that
       your requirements in this field be forwarded as soon as possible and separately from the more
       general requirements in support of the broader intelligence programs.</p>

          <p><gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> was created by <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
           10/2 (under the authority of Sec. 102(d)(5) of the National Security Act of 1947) to
           supplement the overt foreign activities of the U.S. Government and to conduct covert
           operations in support of or to accomplish U.S. foreign policy objectives. The term covert
           operations is defined as embracing all activities (exclusive of operations to secure
           intelligence and of cover and deception for military operations) against hostile foreign
           states or groups or in support of friendly foreign states or groups, which are conducted
           so that any U.S. Government responsibility for them is not evident and that if uncovered
           the responsibility therefor can be denied. Foreign policy objectives are interpreted to
           be those objectives which are established by the President (usually acting through the
           Secretary of State) in pursuance of applicable laws, and enunciated and interpreted
           through various regulations and pronouncements. <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>’s
           source for determination of what is U.S. foreign policy at a given time is the Department
           of State.</p></item>
        </list></item>
      </list>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">2. Interpretation.</hi></p>
      <list>
       <label><hi rend="italic">a.</hi></label>
       <item><p><hi rend="italic">General.</hi></p>
        <p>It is clear that by both law and charter <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> is precluded
         from engaging in operations concerned with the domestic affairs of the United States.
          <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> is authorized to conduct operations only against or in
         support of foreign states or elements thereof. Police, law-enforcement, and internal
         security functions are responsibilities of other U.S. Government agencies; <gloss
          target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> is bound by the presumption that these agencies are
         performing their functions faithfully and effectively.</p>
        <p>What may not be clear is whether <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> is authorized to
         engage in operations within the United States against or in support of a foreign state or
         group and in so doing support U.S. foreign policy objectives. In many instances it might
         appear more practicable to carry out a given operation in the United States than elsewhere.
          <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> is not expressly authorized or forbidden by <gloss
          target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2 to conduct such operations. However, it appears to have
         been the intent of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> that covert operations <pb
          n="59" xml:id="pg_59" facs="0088"/>were only to be executed abroad (cf., purpose of
         establishing <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>: “to supplement the overt <hi
          rend="italic">foreign activities</hi> of the U.S. Government” (underscoring supplied)).
         Moreover and more important, it would be very difficult if not impossible to undertake
         covert operations in the United States in such a manner that “any U.S. Government
         responsibility for them is not evident and that if uncovered the U.S. Government can
         plausibly disclaim any responsibility for them.” The U.S. Government has certain
         responsibilities under international law for acts committed within its jurisdiction which
         might well make impossible disavowal of responsibility for a covert act committed by <gloss
          target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> in the United States. For these reasons it is considered that
         only in the most exceptional circumstances will it be desirable to propose operations which
         are to be executed within the United States.</p></item>
       <label><hi rend="italic">b.</hi></label>
       <item><p><hi rend="italic">Auxiliary Activities.</hi></p>
        <p>It is also evident, however, that <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> does have occasion
         to carry on certain activities within the United States. [<hi rend="italic">3½ lines not
          declassified</hi>] The fact that these activities take place within the United States is,
         however, purely incidental to the main purpose of the <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>
         operation. The essential element is that they are part of operations to be executed abroad
         against hostile foreign states. Such activities have no other relation to the domestic
         affairs of the United States than that they physically take place, for reasons of
         necessity, convenience, security, etc., within the United States. The determinant as to the
         propriety, from the standpoint of <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>’s charter, of an
          <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> undertaking within the United States is therefore the
          <hi rend="italic">objective</hi> of the operation. The ultimate objective of any proposed
         undertaking must clearly be to produce an effect upon a foreign state or group. This effect
         may even be the ultimate reception abroad of an idea which has been produced and
         disseminated within the United States. It is not appropriate to undertake any activity
         which has the objective or primary effect of influencing the foreign or domestic policies
         of the United States, or of influencing the internal security of the United States; or
         which has as its target a domestic group in the United States.</p></item>
       <label><hi rend="italic">c.</hi></label>
       <item><p><hi rend="italic">Preliminary Activities.</hi></p>
        <p>There are certain other kinds of activity which <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> must
         carry on within the United States which are incidental but necessary to the execution of
         its substantive tasks. Some of these are self-evident and will not be dealt with here
         (e.g., personnel recruitment, domestic liaison, matériel procurement). Others are not so
         clearly defined and delineated and consequently provide opportunity for misunderstanding.
         Among these are: <list>
          <item>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (20 lines) not declassified</hi>]</item>
          <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0089"/>
          <item>(2) <hi rend="italic">External Research</hi>—Preliminary to launching some
           operations it may be necessary to perform certain research or to acquire information
           which is necessary for realistic planning. Since <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> is
           not a research organization, it is often obliged to turn to external sources. The
           employment of private individuals and organizations outside the Government is sometimes
           required. In this activity <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> will finance only that
           research which (a) deals with matériel the need for which is essential to <gloss
            target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> operations, and (b) can not be obtained from established
           U.S. governmental research organizations. Here again, however, such contacts with U.S.
           groups, and their utilization, is solely for the support of <gloss target="#t_OPC1"
            >OPC</gloss> operations abroad.</item>
          <item><p>(3) <hi rend="italic">Training</hi>—Providing specialized training is an inherent
            prerequisite to the undertaking of many substantive activities. It is necessary to give
            indoctrination training to staff personnel. It is necessary to train staff agents and
            indigenous agents in doctrine and techniques of secret operations. It may be desirable
            to train individuals or groups of indigenous agents for execution of a particular
            clandestine operation. When it is more convenient and more practicable to do so, such
            training will be administered in the United States.</p>
           <p>There are other types of training which involve personnel not under the permanent or
            complete control of <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> but which enable <gloss
             target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> indirectly to execute operations abroad. The training of a
            selected group of members of a foreign internal security service in anti-sabotage
            techniques might enable <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> effectively to discharge a
            requirement for protection of vital materials or installations in the country
            represented. [<hi rend="italic">4 lines not declassified</hi>] It is appropriate for
             <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> to provide these types of training within the
            United States if (1) the <hi rend="italic">objective</hi> of such training is within the
            charter of <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>, and (2) the training can, for reasons of
            convenience, security, control, or availability of facilities, most effectively be
            provided within the United States. <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> can of course
            provide this training through its own or through other available facilities where it is
            more desirable to do so.</p></item>
          <item>(4) <hi rend="italic">Technological Research and Development</hi>—In order that
           proficiency in execution of operations and capabilities for new operations may be
           constantly expanded, it is desirable to conduct research into and to sponsor the
           development of new devices, weapons, and equipment, including psychological warfare aids.
           It is necessary and appropriate to carry on this activity within the United States. In so
           doing, however, <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> will insofar as practicable conduct
           research and development through other Government agencies, <gloss target="#t_OPC1"
            >OPC</gloss> will not initiate research or development directly through private
           organizations in the United States, except where <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> has
           principal interest in the article to be developed, and where it is demonstrably

      <p>This agreement is entered into between the Department of State (hereinafter referred to as
       the Department) and the Central Intelligence Agency (hereinafter referred to as <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>), to make administrative provisions for budget and finance

       (including Foreign Service personnel) to <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Washington and
       field activities in the continental United States. This agreement also provides a basis for
       such other budget and finance arrangements as may be mutually agreed upon. This agreement
       does not cover those personnel details of a temporary nature [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
        line not declassified</hi>], or regular interservice assignments as provided for in the
       Foreign Service Act, or other nonreimbursable assignments mutually agreed upon. This
       agreement will cover all assignments of Departmental personnel now or hereafter made to all
        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Washington and domestic field office activities unless
       for security reasons appropriate officials determine that reimbursement should be made under
       the terms of the “covert” arrangements. Appendices may be added or amendments made to this
       agreement to cover other budget and finance arrangements of an overt nature as mutually

       will be based upon the salary compensation paid by the Department since other direct costs
       will be borne by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. Quarterly estimates will be based on
       known and anticipated needs for each quarter by grades, positions, and types of officials

      <p rend="center">PRODUCTION OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATES</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Bedell Smith</persName>’s direction of <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has resulted in a significant change in that organization’s
       production of finished intelligence. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is now in the
       business of producing what are called National Intelligence Estimates along the lines laid
       down in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 50. These papers are interdepartmental in
       character, designed to focus all available intelligence <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0096"
       />on a problem of importance to the national security. In the preparation of these Estimates,
        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is now relying on the State Department, rather than its
       own staff, for political and economic intelligence, the Department of the Army for military,
       etc., etc. A reorganization within <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is in process with the
       emphasis on quality rather than quantity of personnel. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>’s
       Office of Reports and Evaluation (<gloss target="#t_ORE1">ORE</gloss>) is being eliminated so
       far as political intelligence is concerned, and a small top level Office of National
       Estimates has been created to integrate the departmental drafts for the approval of the
       Intelligence Advisory Committee (<gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss>). (The <gloss
        target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> advises the Director of Central Intelligence and is made up of
       the chiefs of intelligence of State, Army, Navy, Air, <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>,
        <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss>, and a representative from the Joint Staff in the
       Department of Defense.) Upon approval by the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss>, the paper
       becomes a National Intelligence Estimate and is sent by the Director of Central Intelligence
       to the President, appropriate officers of Cabinet level, and the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
        >NSC</gloss>.</p>
      <p>What all this means to <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss> is simply this: heretofore
       reports written by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>’s former evaluation office (<gloss
        target="#t_ORE1">ORE</gloss>) were sent to the <gloss target="#t_R1">R</gloss> area of the
       Department for comment and concurrence or dissent. In this procedure, the Bureau’s role was
       gauged to the relatively minor importance of these papers. The <gloss target="#t_R1"
        >R</gloss> area checked with the Bureau to insure that the Department was speaking with one
       voice, but the papers seldom dealt with major issues.</p>
      <p>With the new <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> product, however, it is obvious that
       Bureau participation will be more important than it has been in the past. These National
       Intelligence Estimates, as can be seen by the auspices under which they are prepared and
       their eventual destination, carry considerable weight. What the new <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss> Office of National Estimates wants and should have from State is the pooled
       intelligence of the Bureau and <gloss target="#t_R1">R</gloss>. This approach does not mean
       that the Bureau will have to do any original drafting—such drafts will be prepared by the
        <gloss target="#t_R1">R</gloss> area—but it does mean that the Bureau will share the
       responsibility for making State’s contribution.</p>
      <p>In practice, the preparation of a National Intelligence Estimate breaks down into the
       following steps: (1) the <gloss target="#t_R1">R</gloss> area (<gloss target="#t_OIR1"
        >OIR</gloss>) prepares a first draft of the political and/or economic section of the paper
       under interdepartmental agreements as provided for in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 50;
       (2) these sections are then taken by the Office of National Estimates (<gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>) and worked into a draft of the whole paper; (3) this <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> draft is sent to the contributing Departments for comment; (4)
       after consideration by the Departments, it is further discussed in <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss> by an interdepartmental working group; (5) a final draft is then issued by
        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> for approval by the <gloss target="#t_IAC1"
       >IAC</gloss>.</p>
      <p>Although the Bureau may, on occasion, be consulted at stage (1), it will generally not
       enter the picture until stage (3) when the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> draft <pb
        n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0097"/>of the whole paper is sent to the Departments for comment
       and suggestion. Stage (3) should be the beginning and the end of Bureau participation, unless
       the draft is radically changed in the course of its future development either in the working
       group discussion or the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> (see below). The Bureau will
       receive its copy for comment through the Intelligence Adviser. Bureau comment may be made
       either in writing to the Intelligence Adviser, or directly to the <gloss target="#t_OIR1"
        >OIR</gloss> personnel involved (in which case the Intelligence Adviser should be informed).
       In the event that the Bureau or <gloss target="#t_OIR1">OIR</gloss> feel that further
       discussion is needed in order to develop a unified Departmental position, they will notify
       the Intelligence Adviser who will then arrange a meeting for a reconciliation of views. If
       there is a fundamental divergence of interpretation between the Bureau and <gloss
        target="#t_R1">R</gloss>, this fact and the opposing arguments will be presented to the
       Special Assistant for Intelligence who will follow the accepted principles of action and
       review by referring the matter to higher authority for a decision as to the Departmental
       position.</p>
      <p>In this connection it should be noted that the Special Assistant speaks for the Department
       in the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss>. This role has its complications. The <gloss
        target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss>, although formerly concerned almost exclusively with
       jurisdictional matters, has now been transformed under <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General
        Smith</persName>’s chairmanship into a substantive group, which means that there is
       considerable give and take around the table before a final version of an Estimate is
       approved. Should the Special Assistant feel that in his judgment the final version is so
       changed by this give and take as to run counter to the Departmental position, he can either
       ask time for further consideration (in which case the Bureau will be apprised) or, if time
       does not permit, he can publish the Departmental position as a dissent in an appendix to the
       National Estimate.</p>
      <p>Throughout this whole process, it must be recognized that once a National Estimate draft is
       underway, the timing on deadlines for contributions or comments is out of the hands of <gloss
        target="#t_R1">R</gloss>. The Special Assistant will attempt to have these deadlines made
       realistic, but the ultimate decision as to their urgency rests with the <gloss
        target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> itself. Therefore, in order to incorporate the Bureau’s views
       in this new and influential series of intelligence appraisals, it is essential that every
       effort be made within <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss> to meet the due dates
       specified.</p>
      <p>It is hoped that the procedure cited above will not place too great an additional burden on
       Bureau personnel, while, at the same time, it will ensure that the Bureau’s role as a
       contributor of intelligence is being effectively played.</p>

      <p>Reference is made to the Department’s unnumbered circular instruction dated November 5,
       1948 entitled “National Intelligence Studies”.<note n="2" xml:id="d41fn2">Not printed.
        (Ibid., 101.61/11–548)</note> In the above instruction the general outline of the program
       for production of <gloss target="#t_NIS1">NIS</gloss> was announced, and a brief description
       given, both of the purpose of <gloss target="#t_NIS1">NIS</gloss>, and the responsibilities
       of the Department in its production. Since the issuance of this instruction, a number of
       chapters and sections of <gloss target="#t_NIS1">NIS</gloss> relating to various countries
       have been completed. Copies of these portions have regularly been forwarded to the principal
       post in the area concerned under cover of Form DS–4.</p>
      <p>The present international situation has emphasized and greatly increased our requirements
       of both current and basic intelligence. The present greater emphasis on current information
       is obviously in order, but it must not obscure and completely supplant the collection and
       reporting of needed basic information. Planning and the establishment of policy relative to
       national security require basic intelligence, too. Therefore, where at all possible,
       increased attention should be devoted to providing the basic information needed for the
       preparation of the <gloss target="#t_NIS1">NIS</gloss> and to filling in and bringing
       up-to-date chapters and sections which have already been completed.</p>
      <p>In preparing portions of <gloss target="#t_NIS1">NIS</gloss>, every effort is made by the
       producing agency to utilize all pertinent information available in Washington. It has been
       and will continue to be necessary, however, to request additional data and information from
       Foreign Service posts. In some cases it will be expedient to forward to the post concerned
       preliminary drafts of sections for revision or correction and return to the Department.</p>
      <p>It is, of course, very important that portions of <gloss target="#t_NIS1">NIS</gloss> which
       have been produced be revised and kept up-to-date. In the preparation of occasional and
       voluntary reports, Foreign Service personnel are urged to consult available <gloss
        target="#t_NIS1">NIS</gloss> material, and wherever possible, endeavor to <pb n="75"
        xml:id="pg_75" facs="0104"/>augment the information contained therein. Each <gloss
        target="#t_NIS1">NIS</gloss> section and subsection concludes with a paragraph entitled
       “Comments on Principal Sources”, which contains a brief survey of the information gaps and
       weaknesses in the preceding section. These comments are a valuable guide to the basic
       information which is currently not available in Washington and which should, if possible, be
       acquired and reported.</p>
      <p>The Department, and the other agencies cooperating in the <gloss target="#t_NIS1"
        >NIS</gloss> program, welcome and request comments and suggestions from the field concerning
        <gloss target="#t_NIS1">NIS</gloss>. It is requested that completed sections and subsections
       forwarded to posts be brought to the attention of all appropriate personnel at the post.</p>

        <item>This organization is the national agency responsible under specified conditions for
         the “planning, preparation and execution” of the various types of covert operations
         enumerated in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2. Some of these operations do not
         involve armed conflict and will not be discussed in this study. Some of the physical types
         of covert operations might indirectly involve armed conflict but it is primarily in the
         field <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0107"/>of guerrilla warfare that responsibilities of
          <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> (<gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>) and the national
         military forces overlap.</item>

        <item>The responsibility of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> (<gloss target="#t_OPC1"
          >OPC</gloss>) with respect to guerrilla operations differs in peace and war. In peacetime,
          <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> formulates doctrine and technique for utilization and
         employment of guerrilla warfare, plans guerrilla warfare operations to be implemented in
         case of war in response to and consistent with the requirements of the military
         authorities, and within the limits of feasibility, makes the physical preparations
         necessary for such implementation. It foments, supports and conducts only such peacetime
         guerrilla operations as may be authorized by the State Department with the approval of the
         Department of Defense. In wartime, <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> implements plans
         previously prepared, and continues the planning and execution of guerrilla warfare
         operations within the framework of organization and command specified in <gloss
          target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>_______.<note n="8" xml:id="d42fn8"><gloss target="#t_NSC1"
           >NSC</gloss> 10/3, as approved. [Footnote in the original.]</note></item>

       <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Characteristics and Capabilities of <gloss
          target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> (<gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>) in Support of Guerrilla
         Warfare</hi></p>
       <p>4. a. The covert operations of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> (<gloss
         target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>) “do not include armed conflict by organized military forces.”
        Therefore <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> (<gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>) has no
        responsibility for the organization, training or operations of such units as “Commandos,”
        “Rangers,” etc., which are in all respects organic components of national military forces.
        This does not, however, prevent mutual arrangements between the national military forces and
         <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> (<gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>) for employing the
        same facilities, when appropriate, for the training of individuals or groups in subjects of
        common interest.</p>
       <p>b. A distinguishing characteristic of guerrilla operations by <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
         >CIA</gloss> (<gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>) is the employment of relatively limited
        numbers of American <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> (<gloss target="#t_OPC1"
        >OPC</gloss>) personnel. This consists of individual operatives and leaders rather than
        large bodies of men. Such personnel, however, must have specialized qualifications,
        including linguistic and political background, imagination, resourcefulness and initiative.
        They must have access to clandestine intelligence sources. They will be concerned with such
        intricate matters as establishing initial contacts with appropriate leaders of underground
        or guerrilla forces in enemy territory, gaining their confidence and developing their
        capabilities by furnishing communications, weapons, equipment and training, and by
        exercising such controls over their organization and operations as will insure that their
        activities support U.S. political and military objectives.</p>
       <p>c. These operations will generally be strategic rather than tactical in nature. Initially
        and usually they will be deep in enemy territory and will require special intelligence,
        communications and covert transportation <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0108"/>facilities.
        In the initial phases, the fomentation, development and exploitation of indigenous
        underground and guerrilla forces should be exclusively a responsibility of <gloss
         target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> (<gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>). Without wasteful
        duplication, the national military forces could not be expected to have the assembled talent
        and flexibility of organization for such operations.</p>
       <p>d. Most resistance activities and movements in their earlier stages are covert in
        character, and have their origins in the successful establishment and operation of
        underground organizations. As they begin to develop strength, these movements have a
        tendency to come out into the open and under proper circumstances, including support by the
        local population, favorable terrain, and assistance from the outside, develop into organized
        resistance movements on a major scale. Assuming the successful development of large-scale
        and relatively well organized resistance movements behind enemy lines resulting from
        successful covert operations or originating spontaneously, the control and exploitation as
        well as the support and provisioning of such resistance movements should become the
        responsibility of the theater commanders whose interests are most directly affected or
        benefited.</p>
       <p>e. However, such guerrilla movements never entirely lose their covert characteristics in
        that they maintain contacts with underground operatives located in cities and in or near
        centers of enemy control; and moreover, in that they depend for their survival upon extreme
        mobility and secrecy as to their location and movements as of any given time. Finally, they
        remain highly political in their nature and inspiration, and for this as well as other
        reasons already mentioned, cannot be used against all types of objectives and targets. It
        follows that even though control and direction of large organized resistance movements
        should pass to the senior military commanders, there remains the necessity for close
        cooperation by and assistance from those experienced in covert operations.</p>
       <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Responsibility of the National Military Forces in
         Unconventional Combat Methods</hi></p>
       <p>5. a. As previously stated, guerrilla forces are not to be confused with organizations
        such as “Commandos” and “Rangers”. These latter are organized by and are organically a part
        of the national military forces. The combat operations of these types of units will often
        require methods similar to those employed by guerrillas. The training of such organizations
        will, in some respects, be analogous to that of guerrillas. Their operations can best be
        described as employment of “unconventional combat methods” by orthodox forces—unconventional
        only in the sense that they have been little exploited in the American Military Forces and
        are more flexible and adaptable to circumstances than those of conventional combat
        units.</p>
       <p>b. Independent Commando-type units can accomplish close-in or distant raids for a variety
        of purposes. They may include airborne or <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0109"/>landing
        operations. Ranger-type units, organic to the division, consist of specially equipped
        personnel trained in hand-to-hand combat, furtive movement and individual resourcefulness in
        all situations. They are adept at infiltration and disruptive tactics behind enemy lines.
        The activity of these units is limited to the zone of combat of the parent division and is
        employed to assist the division in carrying out its specific missions. These units may at
        times employ local indigenous inhabitants. While they employ tactics similar to guerrillas,
        neither Commando nor Ranger operations are deemed to be guerrilla operations, and <gloss
         target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> (<gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>) has no responsibility
        respecting them.</p>
       <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Responsibility of the National Military Forces in
         Guerrilla Warfare</hi></p>
       <p>6. a. The national military forces rarely, if ever, will be in position to assume
        responsibility for the covert techniques required in fomenting guerrilla movements,
        establishing initial contacts with existing ones, and in the early development of the
        movements into appreciable military assets. This is the mission of <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
         >CIA</gloss> (<gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>) and that agency should be afforded all
        feasible logistical support by the military forces.</p>
       <p>b. In wartime, a guerrilla movement having successfully been built up to a certain
        magnitude, may require military direction and logistical support from an appropriate
        military commander similar to that furnished regularly constituted forces under his command.
        Such direction and support will exceed the resources of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
         (<gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>). At this time, control, exploitation and supply of
        the movement should be assumed by or assigned to the appropriate military commander.
        Nevertheless, for reasons stated in paragraph 4–e, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
         (<gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>) personnel should either serve as, or continue to be a
        part of, the operating link between that commander and the guerrilla forces.</p>
       <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>In some cases a decision by the theater commander becomes necessary as to whether or not
         command of the guerrillas should pass. In a few cases, attended by profound political
         implications, consultation in the matter of command will be advisable between the theater
         commander and higher authority.</p>
       </quote>
       <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
       <p>7. a. Guerrilla warfare is defined as the operations of organized bodies of politically
        motivated and predominantly indigenous irregulars, in or out of uniform, not organically a
        part of national military forces, trained and equipped for armed conflict of specialized
        character and for limited objectives.</p>
       <p>b. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> (<gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>) is the agency
        of this Government which in peacetime has the sole responsibility under specified conditions
        for the planning, preparation and conduct of guerrilla operations. In wartime <gloss

       considers signing the attached draft memorandum addressed to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1"
        >James S. Lay, Jr</persName>. The following considerations with respect to <gloss
        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/3 have been suggested to me within the Department: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>The document as presently worded does not sufficiently assert Department of State
         responsibility, authority and control over the activities set forth in 10/3. Specifically
         paragraph 3a would seem to <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0111"/>place complete control of
         covert operations and clandestine intelligence activities within the <gloss
          target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. Similarly the last sentence in paragraph 3b reenforces
          <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> control. (In active military theatres)<note n="3"
          xml:id="d43fn3">The parenthetical phrase was added by hand. References to paragraphs 3a
          and 3d under points 1 and 2 of this memorandum apparently refer to the earlier draft
          attached to <ref target="#d38">Document 38</ref>.</note></item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item><p>Paragraph 3d then produces [<hi rend="italic">reduces</hi>?] the “coordinating”
          role of the Secretary of State vis-à-vis the Director of Central Intelligence in
          Washington. It has been suggested that this coordinating role is insufficiently explicit
          and does not extend down to the theatre commanders through the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
           >JCS</gloss>.</p>
         <p>It has been suggested to me that the Department should ask for a great deal more in that
          the roles between the Department and the Military Establishment have now reached a point
          where the Department of State is in a position to obtain a great deal more than this
          document provides for. It was therefore suggested that the two alterations marked on page
          2 and page 3 of the draft 10/3 might now be included in the Department’s comment requested
          by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName>.</p>
         <p>I have the following comments to make: <list>
           <label>1.</label>
           <item><persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> and <persName
             corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen W. Dulles</persName> feel that it is necessary at this time to
            obtain for <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> what is set forth in 10/3. They both feel
            that they have gone as far as possible in asserting <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
            >CIA</gloss>’s role vis-à-vis the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> in Washington and
            as related to theatre commanders. As long as the present <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
             >JCS</gloss> position remains in its present state, nothing further can be accomplished
            in increasing the responsibility and authority of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
             >CIA</gloss> particularly in military theatres. As you know, <persName
             corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
             Dulles</persName> are presently in Tokyo in an endeavor to accomplish something with
            General <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> and General
             <persName>Willoughby</persName> which will make it possible for <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
             >CIA</gloss> to play some role in the intelligence field in General <persName
             corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>’s theatre. (Has his theatre ever been defined
            geographically?)</item>
           <label>2.</label>
           <item>The Director of Central Intelligence feels that if he tries to get more than 10/3
            calls for, he might end up by getting much less. In other words, <persName
             corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> is prepared to settle for 10/3 as presently
            drafted on the theory that this gives him enough to work out <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
             >CIA</gloss>’s problems in the command structure given present thinking within the
             <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and the personalities of theatre commanders in time
            of war. <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> does not feel that it
            would be wise at this time, in his endeavor to obtain the necessary degree of authority
            and control over secret operations and clandestine activities, to engage in a
            jurisdictional battle with the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> which would raise
            basic issues, generate heat and <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0112"/>conflict and
            probably result in jeopardizing what <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> now has and can
            get in the present circumstances.</item>
           <label>3.</label>
           <item>My own feeling is that the Department of State can probably not go beyond the
            present language of draft <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/3 in asserting civilian
            responsibility and authority. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">General Magruder</persName>
            and <persName corresp="#p_SVARLC1">Admiral Stevens</persName> agree that this is a fact.
             <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">General Magruder</persName> is an outstanding exponent of
            the theory that war is too serious a business for the generals, is an extension of
            politics, etc., etc. He advises against the Department’s trying to assert itself further
            than is now outlined in the present draft and believes that if it did so the <gloss
             target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> would react violently, and immediate conflict would
            develop and there would be little or no hope of getting even what is set forth in the
            present language of 10/3.</item>
          </list></p>
         <p>I think it will be most useful if Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_MHF1"

      <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AWPJ1">Armstrong</persName>:</p>
      <p>As you know, <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> has written to the
       Secretary of State<note n="2" xml:id="d46fn2">Dated February 1. (Ibid.)</note> to indicate in
       broad terms how he envisions the allocation of certain intelligence responsibilities, in line
       with National Security Council Directives, as between the Department of State and the Central
       Intelligence Agency. This letter was based on the principles agreed to in our recent
       discussions on the responsibilities of the Department and <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89"
        facs="0118"/>Central Intelligence Agency with reference to certain functions formerly
       performed in Central Intelligence Agency by the Office of Reports and Estimates. To assist
       you in planning to meet the additional burden which will fall on the Department, I am
       outlining my understanding of the agreements upon which <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General
        Smith</persName>’s letter is based.</p>
      <p>The Department has responsibility for intelligence research in the political, cultural and
       sociological fields. The research work hitherto performed in these fields by our former
       Office of Reports and Estimates is discontinued and the Department will be responsible for
       meeting the requests from all departments and agencies previously handled by the Office of
       Reports and Estimates. This will include initiation of requirements for intelligence
       collection and evaluation of raw information reports in these fields. The Department will
       undoubtedly have further demands on its resources arising from its increasing participation
       in the preparation of National Intelligence Estimates.</p>
      <p>As a guide towards estimating the increased burden on the Department, I might point out
       that Central Intelligence Agency is discontinuing, among other activities, the following: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>Political research to meet the requests of the National Security Council, the Joint
         Chiefs of Staff and other departments and agencies;</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>Intelligence research for psychological warfare;</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>Intelligence research on international organizations, particularly United
         Nations;</item>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item>Intelligence research on world Communism;</item>
        <label>5.</label>
        <item>Intelligence research in the political, cultural and sociological fields for the
         internal needs of Central Intelligence Agency.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>The Central Intelligence Agency wishes to assist the Department in meeting these new
       responsibilities, as is indicated in <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>’s
       letter. To fulfill this obligation, Central Intelligence Agency is prepared to: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>Provide, for the remainder of fiscal 1951, funds for additional personnel up to the
         amount of $200,000. We have both estimated that the number of additional personnel which
         the Department may need is approximately 150.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>Cooperate in the detail or transfer to the Department of any available personnel
         formerly engaged in the Office of Research and Estimates. The Department is free to discuss
         such detail or transfer directly with the personnel involved.<note n="3" xml:id="d46fn3"
          >This assistance was presumably to tide the Department over until the positions were
          properly authorized and budgeted.</note></item>
       </list></p>
      <p>I understand that working negotiations are under way on these points. Copies of this letter
       have been distributed to the appropriate <pb n="90" xml:id="pg_90" facs="0119"/>officers in
       this organization for policy guidance. I hope you and I may meet for further discussions if
       the need arises in the course of these negotiations.</p>

      <p>The Secretary desires Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCH1">Humelsine</persName> or Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_BEW1">Barrett</persName>, or the proper person, to prepare for him a short paper
       on the programs that are being discussed with Admiral <persName>Souers</persName>. He wants
       to know particularly what programs are going which are not subject to our coordination now.
       What is the subject matter of these programs, both overt and covert?</p>
      <p>After the Secretary has studied this matter, he is inclined to agree to a meeting that
       would include himself, Admiral <persName>Souers</persName>, <persName>Fred Lawton</persName>,
        <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">Bedell Smith</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LRA1">Bob
        Lovett</persName> to thrash the matter out.</p>

       <item><gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Daily Summary</item>
      </list>
      <p>In opening the meeting, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJQ1">Reber</persName> stated in
       substance that: 1) After consultations with the President, <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss> had decided to continue to publish its Daily Summary but to recast the
       publication in the form of a true “Intelligence Summary” rather than a mere summary of
       telegrams; and 2) <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> desired to obtain from the Department
       an additional copy of all S/S telegrams for a new Office of Current Intelligence, which will
       be established to publish the new Daily.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName>Barnes</persName><note n="2" xml:id="d48fn2"><persName>Robert G.
         Barnes</persName>, Chief of the Policy Reports Staff, Executive Secretariat.</note> stated
       that while the Department had always desired to keep the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
       Director and the analysts in the Office of National Estimates fully informed of current
       developments of a sensitive nature, we had always had certain reservations regarding the
       Daily Summary, particularly with respect to its distribution. He pointed out that the <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Daily Summary had never been an “Intelligence Summary” as such
       and that we have been concerned at times in the past regarding the use of sensitive and
       operational S/S telegrams in that publication, particularly after the distribution of the
       Summary had been extended to include persons not normally receiving S/S–<gloss target="#t_R1"
        >R</gloss> telegrams.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJQ1">Reber</persName> expressed the view that the distribution
       of the Summary was an incidental question; that it was necessary in the first instance to
       determine the intelligence need to be met by the new Summary; and that it was necessary in
       any event for the new Office of Current Intelligence to receive all pertinent information,
       including S/S telegrams, in order to do an adequate job.</p>
      <p>At this point there was a long and inconclusive discussion of whether it was necessary for
       the editors of the new Daily to have access to all sensitive and operational materials in
       order for them to select intelligently the significant items for reporting and whether it was
       feasible to publish a true “Intelligence Summary” on a daily basis. In <pb n="92"
        xml:id="pg_92" facs="0121"/>this connection, there was a divergence of opinion among the
        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> people themselves as to whether they could publish on a
       periodic basis the type of “Intelligence Summary” they apparently had in mind.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName>Barnes</persName> explained the various channels through which <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> received Department telegrams and expressed doubt that the
       Office of National Estimates and Office of Current Intelligence in <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss> required equal treatment with respect to S/S telegrams. He stressed in this
       connection overall responsibilities of S/S concerning the distribution of sensitive material
       to other agencies and the relationship of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Daily
       Summary to this problem.</p>
      <p>It was finally agreed that: 1) <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> would develop and
       present to the Department more concrete proposals with respect to the type of publication
       they had in mind, the distribution it should receive, etc, in justification of their request;
       and 2) in the interim, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">Smith</persName> was authorized to
       make available to the editor of the new Summary copies of “information only” S/S telegrams on
       a trial basis in order for <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to determine its possible
       future need for this type of material in connection with the new Summary.</p>

       <item>Meeting with Admiral <persName>Souers</persName></item>
      </list>
      <p>Regarding your meeting with Admiral <persName>Souers</persName>:</p>
      <p>When the parties concerned were unable to resolve their differences over who should
       supervise psychological strategy now and in event of war, the question was referred to the
        <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>.<note n="2" xml:id="d49fn2">See <ref target="#d45"
         >Documents 45</ref> and <ref target="#d47">47</ref>.</note> The President then directed
       Admiral <persName>Souers</persName>, with the assistance of the Bureau of the Budget, to
       study the subject and make recommendations.</p>
      <p>The Admiral came up with what he considered a compromise plan. This was a plan for a board
       as proposed by the Defense Department, <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0122"/>consisting of
       one representative each from State, Defense, Joint Chiefs and <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss>, plus an “independent” chairman. However, the Admiral proposed that the
       chairman should report to the National Security Council—not to the President as recommended
       by Defense.</p>
      <p>We have objected strenuously to this plan, and accordingly, we understand it hasn’t been
       presented to the President.</p>
      <p>Subsequent discussion with Admiral <persName>Souers</persName> developed the fact that he
       had in mind a board whose field would be far broader than that discussed in any of the <gloss
        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 74 papers.<note n="3" xml:id="d49fn3">See <ref target="#d17"
         >Document 17</ref>.</note> The original papers all specified that the board would give
       broad direction to overt information and psychological warfare matters and just “coordinate
       with” covert psychological operations. The Admiral, it developed, was thinking in terms of a
       board that would plan general strategy for virtually all unconventional warfare measures.
       These would include overt psychological strategy, covert psychological strategy (whispering
       campaigns, etc.), covert operations of the old <gloss target="#t_OSS1">OSS</gloss> variety,
       and perhaps certain economic warfare measures (like pre-emptive buying).</p>
      <p>Admiral <persName>Souers</persName> has implied in private conversations that he believes
       the planning for perfectly overt psychological operations should continue under the
       coordination of the Secretary of State, as is now the case with our Psychological Strategy
       Board, which presently operates under the authority given the Secretary in <gloss
        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 59<note n="4" xml:id="d49fn4">For the text of <gloss
         target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 59/1, see <ref target="#d2">Document 2</ref>.</note> and which
       would be strengthened under State’s version of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 74. He
       seems, however, inclined to advocate the creation under <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
       of a superboard to coordinate overt psychological planning with planning in all the other
       unconventional warfare fields mentioned above.</p>
      <p>The following is a listing of U.S. foreign propaganda programs in being or planned and the
       state of coordination with each:</p>
      <p>In addition to the Department’s <gloss target="#t_USIE1">USIE</gloss> program, programs are
       now being carried on or are planned by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, <gloss
        target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss>, Army, Air Forces, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and
        <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss>.</p>
      <p>The Department, <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss>, Army, <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
        >NATO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss> are now engaged in overt
       information activity abroad.</p>
      <p>Coordination of overt operations by the Department is undertaken through the National
       Psychological Strategy Board (members: State, as Chairman, Defense, <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
        >JCS</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> and
        <gloss target="#t_NSRB1">NSRB</gloss>) which has been set up under <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
        >NSC</gloss> 59, and through direct liaison in the U.S. and abroad between the Department
       and the agencies concerned. The independent charters held by <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
        >ECA</gloss> and the Army occasion a lack of coordination <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94"
        facs="0123"/>and/or duplication in some operations such as the Armed Forces Radio Service
       and the activity of some <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> country units.</p>
      <p>Covert propaganda operations are centered in <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> although
       the <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> and Army, in some instances, appear to be involved in
       activity of this nature (to the apparent annoyance of <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
       >CIA</gloss>).</p>
      <p><gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> covert propaganda operations are coordinated with the
       Department through an agreement for direct liaison between P and <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss>’s Office of Policy Coordination (<gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>), through
       the role of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JRP1">Joyce</persName> (S/P) as <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss> consultant, and through <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> participation in
       the National Psychological Strategy Board. I consider that coordination in this field is
       satisfactory, but do not know and do not need to know the substance of all of <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>’s programs. <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> and Army covert
       or semi-covert operations are not coordinated with State or <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss> in all cases. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and <gloss
        target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss> information operations are in the formative stage, and we
       are working out the problems of coordination. No major problems here have been uncovered so
       far.</p>
      <p>Psychological warfare in areas of military operations is under the control of the theatre
       commander, as in Korea.</p>
      <p>There is a substantial lack of coordination in relation to psychological operations in
       Korea. This is a problem not only for the Department but for the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
        >JCS</gloss>, the Department of the Army and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.</p>
      <p>Research in psychological warfare is being undertaken by State, Army, Air Forces, and
        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.</p>
      <p>There is a definite lack of coordination in the field of psychological warfare research,
       particularly within the defense establishment.</p>

       <item>It was proposed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> that a basic step
        toward integration might be the adjustment of the geographical divisions in the two offices
        so that they correspond to each other. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFG1">Wisner</persName>
        said that this might prove difficult in certain instances and cited Italy as an example. He
        said that <gloss target="#t_OPC1">O/PC</gloss> in Italy falls naturally into the Western
        Hemisphere bloc, whereas in <gloss target="#t_OSO1">O/SO</gloss> it is in the
        Mediterranean-Balkan area. It was pointed out that [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
         declassified</hi>]. It was concluded that this matter would be studied and that there
        probably would be adjustments necessary on both sides.</item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>There was discussion of making the staffs in both offices correspond to each other. It
        was pointed out that Mr. <persName>O’Gara</persName> has plans for the administrative staffs
        of both offices which will make them identical. It was decided that a committee composed of
        Col. <persName>Johnston</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>, and
        Mr. <persName>O’Gara</persName> should study this problem and come up with
        recommendations.</item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>There was discussion of the level on which <gloss target="#t_OSO1">O/SO</gloss> and
         <gloss target="#t_OPC1">O/PC</gloss> operations should be coordinated. <gloss
         target="#t_OPC1">O/PC</gloss> feels that there should be specialists at a certain level. It
        was suggested that this level might be the area region which would be the bottom of the
        merger. It was suggested that each area division be combined with the deputy for each
        activity. The pattern by area may vary. It was pointed out that the “confidential”
        activities of <gloss target="#t_OPC1">O/PC</gloss> as distinguished from the “secret”
        operations might be separated. The general operations of the two offices break down into
        political-economic, paramilitary, and intelligence. It was also suggested that perhaps area
        divisions might have a deputy for each of these activities rather than a deputy for <gloss
         target="#t_OSO1">O/SO</gloss> and one for <gloss target="#t_OPC1">O/PC</gloss>.</item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item><gloss target="#t_OPC1">O/PC</gloss> raised the question of the responsibility for

        that it is the <gloss target="#t_OSO1">O/SO</gloss> function to get intelligence from these
        groups. A task force composed of Mr. <persName>Angleton</persName>, Mr. [<hi rend="italic"

      <p>Because of certain changes in <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> organization the

      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">4. Psychological Strategy Board</hi></p>
      <p>On August 17, 1950, the Department of State issued a press release (attached as Tab E)
       announcing the establishment of a national psychological strategy board under the Secretary
       of State.<note n="7" xml:id="d52fn7">Printed in Department of State <hi rend="italic"
         >Bulletin</hi>, August 28, 1950, p. 335.</note> This Strategy Board was in fact nothing
       more than the “Director” and the “Consultants” under <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>–59,
       including the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> representative. This step was <pb n="100"
        xml:id="pg_100" facs="0129"/>taken in recognition of the necessity for conducting
       psychological measures in connection with the hostilities in Korea and the increasingly
       critical world-wide situation. The activities of the “organization” were in fact intensified,
       as the Board has met more frequently since the announcement and has dealt with more problems
       of a psychological character requiring joint political and military action.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">5. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>–74</hi></p>
      <p>In July, 1950 the Under Secretary of State transmitted to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
        >NSC</gloss> a report prepared by the Organization established pursuant to <gloss
        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>–59. This report was issued for clearance as <gloss
        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>–74 (attached as Tab F).</p>
      <p>This paper has been prepared principally during the period prior to Korea and was based on
       the tacit assumption that any war would be general and would break out without warning. It
       provided an “initial stage” of psychological warfare organization to be invoked on D–day, or
       earlier at the discretion of the President, and a plan for the “subsequent stages” to be
       established as rapidly thereafter as possible.</p>
      <p>The plan for the initial stages of war recognized the responsibility of the Secretary of
       State to “formulate national psychological warfare policy and issue psychological warfare
       policy directives to appropriate departments and agencies of the U.S. Government” and to
       “coordinate policies and plans for overt psychological warfare with the Department of
       Defense” and other agencies. The plan also directed the Secretary of State to make “detailed
       plans and preparations to employ psychological warfare to the maximum in consonance with this
       plan.” It was recognized that overt psychological warfare would be executed in theaters of
       military operations by theater commanders and in other areas by the Department of State.</p>
      <p>For the “initial stages” the Interdepartmental Foreign Information Organization was to be
       “augmented” and established as an Interim Psychological Warfare Board to act as the
       “Executive Agent” of the Secretary of State in the execution of his planning and coordinating
       responsibility for psychological warfare. The Board was to be composed of a Chairman
       representing the Secretary of State, a Vice-Chairman representing the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
       and one representative each from State, Defense, and <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss>.</p>
      <p>The plan for the “subsequent stages” provided a National Psychological Warfare Board
       “composed of a Chairman, appointed by the President and directly responsible to him; a member
       designated by and representing the Department of State; a member chosen from the Joint Chiefs
       of Staff organization, designated by and representing the Department of Defense; and a member
       designated by and representing the Central Intelligence Agency.”</p>
      <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0130"/>
      <p>On September 13, 1950, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JL1">Johnson</persName> submitted to
       the Executive Secretary of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> his comments on <gloss
        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>–74<note n="8" xml:id="d52fn8">Not found.</note> (attached as
       Tab G). He proposed the immediate implementation of the plan for the “initial stages”, but he
       considered it inadequate even for the situation at that time and thought that “we should move
       to create immediately an independent psychological planning board in the Executive Office of
       the President.” The chairman would have been directly responsible to the President and the
       board members would have been full-time appointees not representing the Departments.</p>
      <p>Also on September 14, the Under Secretary of State advised the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
        >NSC</gloss> that the Department of State approved <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>–74
       except for the subsequent stages plan, which he believed required further study.<note n="9"
        xml:id="d52fn9">Not found.</note> (See Tab H.) He also stated that he had “taken steps to
       strengthen the Inter-departmental Foreign Information Organization established under <gloss
        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>–59/1, so that it may meet the requirements of situations where
       joint military and political action is necessary in the field of psychological warfare”,
       referring to the establishment of the psychological strategy board.</p>
      <p>After further study within the Department, a draft <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>–74/1
       (attached as Tab I) was developed.<note n="10" xml:id="d52fn10">Not found.</note> In an
       effort to meet the requirements of the present situation, this paper provided for the
       establishment of a National Psychological Strategy Board (or National Psychological Warfare
       Board in time of war) “as the coordinating agent for the Secretary of State” with respect to
       his responsibility to “recommend broad policies and plans for the national psychological
       effort designed to achieve a maximum support of U.S. national objectives” and to “review the
       plans and programs of agencies executing psychological measures for conformity with national
       policy.” The chairman was to be designated by the Secretary of State, the vice-chairman by
        <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and additional members by State, Defense, and <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. This paper spoke of the “National Psychological Effort” in
       order to avoid the controversy about whether “psychological warfare” is conducted in time of
       peace, and to make adequate provision for the present situation. It was the position of the
       Department of State that organization in time of war should be subjected to further
       study.</p>
      <p>Following discussion of the new State Department draft by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
        >NSC</gloss> senior staff, it was determined that agreement between the Departments could
       not be secured. A memorandum of disagreement was prepared <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102"
        facs="0131"/>(attached as Tab J) and submitted for <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
       consideration, together with an additional memorandum from the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
        >JCS</gloss><note n="11" xml:id="d52fn11">Neither found.</note> (attached as Tab K). The
       senior staff memorandum stated the essential issue as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“Should responsibility at the national level for psychological policy formulation, within
         the framework of approved national policies, and for the coordination and evaluation of the
         national psychological effort, including authority to issue policy guidance to all
         Departments and agencies of the Government executing portions of the psychological effort
         (1) be assigned to the Secretary of State, or, (2) be assigned to an official independent
         of any Department and responsible to the President.”</p>
       </quote></p>
      <p>After <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> consideration on January 4, the President
       referred these memoranda “to Mr. <persName>Souers</persName> and the Bureau of the Budget for
       further study and recommendation to the President.”<note n="12" xml:id="d52fn12">Not further

      <p rend="flushleft">Dear <persName corresp="#p_BGON1">General Bradley</persName>:</p>
      <p>Herewith as discussed during our conference last Monday (see Annex 1)<note n="2"
        xml:id="d54fn2">Attached but not printed.</note> are estimates of the support which is or
       which may be needed by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> from the Department of Defense in
       order to carry out projects which have already been approved or which it is possible may be
       approved within the near future in accordance with our estimate of present trends of policy.
       Our estimated requirements are listed under three categories as follow: those already
       requested under approved projects; those required for the support of approved projects,
       requests for which will be made within the next thirty days; those required for the support
       of projects which are still tentative or which are still in the discussion state.</p>
      <p>These latter are largely guesswork but the guesswork is educated to the extent that it is
       based on past experience and on our estimate of future possibilities.</p>
      <p>For cross reference, in Annex 2,<note n="3" xml:id="d54fn3">Not found.</note> we have
       indicated the requirements for covert operations by project, listing those which fall within
       the above three categories.</p>
      <p>As I mentioned during Monday’s conference, the responsibilities which are being placed upon
       us under our Charter and under <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> directives, particularly
       in the field of planning and execution of guerrilla warfare activities, go beyond our current
       capabilities and indeed embrace operations of such magnitude that they threaten to absorb the
       resources of this Agency to a point which might be detrimental to its other
       responsibilities.</p>
      <p>In order to bring these activities into proper focus a statement will be submitted to the
       Joint Chiefs of Staff within the next 60 days,<note n="4" xml:id="d54fn4"><persName
         corresp="#p_SGWB1">Smith</persName> sent a follow-up letter to <persName corresp="#p_BGON1"

      <p rend="flushleft">Dear <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>:</p>
      <p>I have read your letter (TS #43690) of 2 March 1951<note n="2" xml:id="d56fn2"><ref
         target="#d54">Document 54</ref>.</note> with interest, and note that you are preparing a
       statement for submittal to the Joint Chiefs of Staff giving your estimate of the support
       required from the Department of Defense in order to meet your responsibilities in the field
       of operations.</p>
      <p>The assets which may be generated by requirements for operations in the cold war can be
       expected to be of proportionate value in case overt global war should intervene, and for some
       time all of us have been acquiring a considerable body of experience in learning the
       mechanics of dealing with the complex elements that are involved.</p>
      <p>It seems to me that much of the support which is visualized in the enclosures to your
       letter can be provided by arrangements which have already been set in motion and are well
       advanced. This leads me to hope that we will not have too much difficulty in handling the
       situation within the current framework, but it is, of course, a proper subject for further
       exploration and discussion with the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
      <p>Financing appears to be a matter between you and the Congress, but you may be assured that
       I shall support your efforts to obtain funds for any conception of your plans and operations
       which has been accepted by Defense.</p>

      <p>The <persName>Troy</persName> Report almost uniformly reflects a very high order of
       technical competence, political sophistication, and common sense. It deserves the most
       serious consideration. It lays down principles and techniques for the conduct of political
       warfare which, with few exceptions, seem worthy of adoption. On the non-technical side its
       value is not so much its originality—few of the ideas will seem original to anyone who has
       sat around the S/P table—as its cogency. Development of Staff views as to what
       recommendations should be adopted, and how we can secure their adoption, would seem to be in
        order.<note n="3" xml:id="d59fn3">Another evaluation of the <persName>Troy</persName> report
        is in a memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_AWPJ1">Armstrong</persName> to <persName
         corresp="#p_BEW1">Barrett</persName>, March 26, which complimented the report for “its
        appreciation of the nature of political warfare and in its proposals as to the techniques
        that could be employed in disseminating our propaganda and otherwise carrying on political
        warfare activities.” In his memorandum <persName corresp="#p_AWPJ1">Armstrong</persName>
        also offered a critique of the “over-all substantive approach” of the
         <persName>Troy</persName> report. (National Archives, RG 59, <gloss target="#t_INR1"
         >INR</gloss> Files: Lot 58 D 776, Box 14)</note></p>
      <p>Following are its highlights. I am intruding my own comments only with respect to
       recommendations which seem to be questionable.</p>
      <p rend="center">Volume I—Foreword</p>
      <p>Explains that although the initial study was directed primarily toward the technical
       problems confronting <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> because of Soviet jamming, it was
       agreed that other methods of piercing the Iron Curtain should be examined, “and that the
       nature of any technical facility was inevitably tied to the target and to the content of the
       material to be conveyed and finally to the effect which was ultimately desired.” (p. viii)
       Thus the study has emerged with the concept of “political warfare”. “The newness of our idea,
       if any, lies in the understanding of the strategic power of the several elements when
       combined as a well rounded and coordinated whole.… the idea that the United States must
       develop a coordinated political warfare effort is the most important idea in the report.” (p.
       ix)</p>
      <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0140"/>
      <p rend="center">Part I—Political Warfare</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Chapter I—Political Warfare</hi></p>
      <p>Urges the “unification of political warfare”, which “should be organized like any form of
       warfare, with specialized weapons, strategy, tactics, logistics, and training”. (p. 3)</p>
      <p rend="center">Part II—Communication Into Shielded Areas</p>
      <p>Deals with means of communication for piercing the Iron Curtain, mentioning, besides radio
       and balloons, and other existing ways, the use of direct mail to send professional journals
       and industrial and commercial publications and questions “Impulsive emotional blockades of
       this kind of communication, such as the recent ban on shipments of <hi rend="italic">The Iron
        Age</hi>”. It also mentions sending of objects, typical of American life, drugs, flash
       lights, fountain pens, small radio receivers, etc.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Chapter II—Radio</hi></p>
      <p>“Really important advances can be made along two complementary lines: a) by developing a
       broadcasting system which combines standard elements in a special way to achieve the effect
       of enormous power and, b) by developing a tiny, cheap, self-contained, durable receiver that
       could eventually be distributed in large numbers over the world.” (p. 11) It notes that a
       hundred, perhaps a thousand, Soviet jamming transmitters are in use, which “appear to be <hi
        rend="italic">centrally controlled</hi>, although the individual transmitters are widely
       distributed”. (p. 13) “The evidence suggests that the operation is growing in scale and is a
       direct and major threat to high-frequency radio communication <hi rend="italic">within</hi>
       and <hi rend="italic">to</hi> Europe generally”. (p. 14)</p>
      <p>Recommends use of “the coherent transmitter” technique whereby a ten unit cluster,
       radiating one megawatt each, costing about 1.5 million dollars apiece, would have the same
       power as a single one hundred megawatt unit, “and if well-located could reach most of Eastern
       Europe at night.… (a) it cannot easily be jammed over a large area; (b) it can be heard with
       a receiver as insensitive as a simple crystal set”. (p. 21)</p>
      <p>Recommends also “a concerted effort to develop crystal and transistor receivers for mass
       production”. (p. 22)</p>
      <p>Points out “The Russian jamming operation seems to us to have clear and serious
       implications extending beyond the immediate problems of the Voice of America.… Already there
       have been instances of deliberate, effective jamming of intercontinental point-to-point
       transmissions, both United States and British.… If our high-frequency transmissions were
       jammed (they could be jammed tomorrow) and the Atlantic cables cut by submarine action, air
       mail would be our only means of communication with Europe.… the problem must be faced, <pb
        n="112" xml:id="pg_112" facs="0141"/>as a matter of national security, now.… A wideband
       transatlantic communication facility, reliable and secure against jamming, can and must be
       provided. The appropriate agency should at once sponsor a thorough engineering study of the
       several possible methods. The national telecommunications policy must be reexamined.… The
       challenge of the electro-magnetic war is serious and we are not organized to meet it.” (pp.
       24–27)</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Chapter III—Balloons</hi></p>
      <p>“An area of a million square miles could be saturated with a billion propaganda sheets in a
       single balloon operation costing a few million dollars.… If the area of dispersal in such an
       operation were restricted to 30,000 square miles, which may be practicable, there would be a
       leaflet laid down, on the average, for each area of 30 by 30 feet.… The dispersion of
       balloons in flight and the dispersion of leaflets in falling from altitude both lend
       themselves to saturation operations.… Production specifications should be established now and
       productive capacity should be located.… The operational testing and production program should
       be undertaken now. It may cost about one million dollars.… In order to coordinate balloon use
       with other political warfare operations, organizational planning for the final operations
       should start now.… A stockpile sufficient for an actual operation should be created now, and
       the questions of size and type of stock should be reviewed periodically as the program
       develops”. (pp. 29–35)</p>
      <p rend="center">Part III—Notes on Target Areas</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Introduction</hi></p>
      <p>Observes that <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> “programs should deal insofar as possible
       with subjects that are matters of real <hi rend="italic">emotional concern</hi> to the

      <p>Notes that appeals to reason or efforts to modify ideological views have small chance of
       success. Suggests efforts should be directed toward undermining Soviet rulers’ confidence in
       themselves and each other: noting possibility of producing deterioration in administrative
       structure “by overloading the system with material introduced from outside”; disturbing
       confidence of the leaders by increasing defection; stimulating mutual distrust by artificial
       means, bogus letters, etc.; promoting distrust of dependability of military and political
       organizations among the satellites. Comments that although the “full and fair” formula is
       officially abandoned, it remains in the habits of psychological warfare operators. Recommends
       “We should avoid the position, express <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0142"/>or implied,
       that communism is bad, or any implication of contempt for communism … rather … that Stalinism
       has betrayed certain ideals of Marxism which have actually had a peaceful evolution in the
       West.… Discord in the United States is not only tolerable but actually necessary. Variation
       and divergence … are … an evidence of strength, not weakness… There should be no direct or
       indirect disparaging of Soviet culture.” (pp. 44–45)</p>
      <p>Our principal targets should be the intelligentsia, skilled workers, bureaucrats, personnel
       of the mechanized armed forces, rural areas. Major themes should be “The Soviet peoples have
       proven themselves capable, patriotic, hard-working … having with their sweat and blood built
       up a large scale industry and modern agriculture, are now being denied the fruits of their
       labor by a harsh and grasping regime.… the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the
       United States … have … common interests and common attitudes.… Americans grant that the
       teachings of Marx, Engels, and Lenin have great historical importance. Yet the Stalinist
       system has not evolved … as Marx and Engels would have wished”. (p. 46) The handling of the
       material “should be persistent, simple and consistent … based on genuine sophistication in
       Stalinist thinking … truly personal … occasionally seek the opportunity for drama … should
       get on the band-wagon at the earliest possible moment for programs which are certain to be
       widely popular among the Russian people, even if they also have official Russian support.”
       (pp. 46–47)</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Chapter V—Europe</hi></p>
      <p>Proposes “a program based on the concept of European unity.… one must look to European
       tradition itself.… Nor will mere verbal argument suffice if in our other acts we appear to
       encourage the continuance of inequities or special privilege long associated with the
       managerial elites of European society.” (pp. 51–55)</p>
      <p>Recommends exploiting the opportunities offered by Yugoslavia.</p>
      <p>Recommends considering seriously the inclusion of satellite and possibly Russian units in
       the all-European Army and, with suitable acknowledgment of the difficulty of the problem,
       emphasizes the importance and the genuine possibility of organizing a European Army with
       national units as small as companies. (Comment: The inclusion of satellite and Russian units
       under their own flags or so organized as to appear to the world as national units would seem
       questionable prior to an outbreak of hostilities. But they should be so organized that they
       can readily be converted into national units. The Report’s unwillingness to accept the
       assumption that national units in the European Army must be of division size seems warranted,
       provided the problem is approached with suitable realism and flexibility.) The economic
       program should be designed to reduce the inequalities between social classes, <pb n="114"
        xml:id="pg_114" facs="0143"/>reduce the feeling of isolation from sources of raw materials

       needed now a special Presidential Commission on Aid to Asia”. (p. 66) Political warfare
       operations “should operate at the local level and specially trained technical personnel

      <p>The remaining recommendations are closely similar to the policy decisions already taken and
       now pending with respect to defectors, except for a recommendation, the necessity for which

      <p>“In the absence of plans the conduct of political warfare tends to become a series of
       defensive responses to enemy action.… The success of our political warfare depends finally,
       upon the public support of national policies.… What is needed, what is indeed indispensable,
       is a planned research effort to insure first, that scarce resources of personnel, wherever
       located, are assigned tasks of the highest priority and second, that pieces of the research
       mosaic not lying clearly within the responsibility of existing agencies are supplied to
       complete the whole picture.… there must be some <hi rend="italic">single authority</hi>
       concerned with political warfare exclusively, with the capacity to design a comprehensive
       program and the power to obtain execution of this program through the effective action of all
       the agencies and departments that are now engaged in waging political warfare.” (pp.
       79–81)</p>
      <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0144"/>
      <p rend="center">Volume II</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Annex 1—Political Warfare</hi></p>
      <p>Points out that “the rise of technology has so changed the play of economic and social
       forces that the questions that now divide nations … go too deep to yield easily to
       negotiation … international relations must therefore increasingly be conducted through
       channels that reach the mass of people directly”. (pp. 1–2)</p>
      <p>Observes that U.S. Civil War was the first since the religious wars of the 17th Century to
       be fought consciously over an idea, and was fought not by professional armies but by masses
       of men representative of the whole society, with spectacular losses on both sides, won less
       by superior tactical skill than by overwhelming weight, and ended in unconditional surrender.
       “Technological advance has now put in our hands logistical weapons of such power that we find
       ourselves literally unable to use them for limited objectives. War has become for us not only
       all-out but all-or-none.… Even though such a weapon might win a war, it probably would not do
       so in a way that will lead to a satisfactory peace. Atomic war thus falls outside the
       Clausewitz definition. Its possession gives us time to develop a united world, but its use
       will not continue that policy.” (p. 3)</p>
      <p>Thus, we must seek other ways of reaching our international objectives. “Fear of all-out
       war has so far kept us from aggressive steps to halt the Russian advance. This is just the
       wrong attitude. A carefully planned series of forward steps that erode the Russian power
       provides the best way of avoiding, not provoking, the last great battle of the West … we must
       remember clearly that all international actions—wars included—are directed at the minds and
       emotions of men.… This interconnected simultaneous use of all instruments of international
       action to obtain a single objective is what we call, in this Report, political warfare.… a
       political war consisting of well-planned attacks on a series of limited objectives will make

       in the number of problems referred upward for a decision. How far could the Soviet system go
       in increasing the decision-making powers at the lower ranks before it fell below the critical
       level of centralized control for maintaining a dictatorship? We should explore all the

       resistance, and social groupings by classes, sex and age, the peasantry, nationality groups,
       party affiliation, and military-civil.</p>
      <p>It recommends strongly against “the non-Party people being set off against the Party
       members. This has long been a shaky proposition, because it neglected the structure of the
       Party and the diversity of its actual roles in Soviet society.… A very high proportion of
       displaced <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0146"/>persons … maintain that a large number of
       the Party people are blameless, were forced into their membership, and do their best not to
       harm people.… To stress the theme of Party as against non-Party people might serve to push
       them deeper into the Party rather than away from it.” The crucial differentiation is between
       “we” and “they”, “between the ordinary, poor driven people both within and without the Party,
       and those in power or associated and/or identified with it”. (p. 12)</p>
      <p>“The suggested approach does not slight, minimize, or debunk Soviet accomplishments. A
       series error is often made in assuming that because so many Soviet citizens seem to have so
       strong a rejection of the Soviet regime, they equally reject all of its works and
       institutions. Nothing could be further from the truth. Work with defectors indicates that
       even among the most disaffected there tends to be strong personal, even emotional,
       identification with many of the features of society developed under Soviet rule.…</p>
      <p>“By the same token, we should be exceedingly cautious in attacking the Soviet system not to
       permit the impression that this means for us the sweeping away of all the basic institutions
       of contemporary Soviet society and their replacement by institutions imported from the West.
       Our central appeal is the promise of an end to the oppressive, compulsive totalitarian
       aspects of the Soviet regime.…</p>
      <p>“… There are two closely related themes which meet the requirements indicated. The first
       stresses that the Soviet regime is impersonal, harsh, capricious, with little or no respect
       for the human dignity or for the basic rights to justice and fair play of a hardworking,
       decent, long-suffering people. The second stresses that the Soviet people have made great
       sacrifices and endured extraordinary hardship and suffering to build up in the Soviet Union a
       great and powerful industry and a promising agricultural establishment, but they are being
       denied the fruits of their labor and the just reward for their suffering—which itself need
       never have been so great or so long-lasting—by a regime which is exploiting the ordinary

       measures of assistance “will increase in even greater proportion the number of mouths”.</p>
      <p>Suggests efforts to build up in such areas of the Far East “somewhat different attitudes
       toward individual life than now exists. Specifically, this change can be described in terms
       of encouraging mothers to recognize the value of having a limited number of healthy,
       energetic and well-nourished children rather than a succession of sick, feeble and starving

      <p>Recommends study of the political control systems utilized for influencing the decisions of
       groups holding or seeking power, analysis of the social structure of key target areas, and of
       basic attitudes of target populations, investigation of major channels of communication
       within a country and existing attitudes towards materials carried in these channels,
       continuing studies of domestic vulnerability to political warfare, and research on the
       changing of attitudes.</p>
      <p>Also recommends research in support of the defector program, on the use of radio, the

       functions of the new Psychological Strategy Board.<note n="2" xml:id="d62fn2">See <ref
         target="#d60">Document 60</ref>.</note> In particular I want to state my exceptions to Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_BEW1">Barrett</persName>’s memorandum to you of March 29, 1951, on the
       subject: Plans for Psychological Strategy Board.<note n="3" xml:id="d62fn3">The memorandum by
         <persName corresp="#p_BEW1">Barrett</persName> has not been found. An unsigned March 26
        draft prepared by <persName>Leon Crutcher</persName> of the Management Staff is in National
        Archives, RG 59, P Files: Lot 55 D 339.</note></p>
      <p>That memorandum speaks of the board’s jurisdiction as including “the development of
       proposals in the field of military, political and economic action geared for psychological
       effect and to the development of campaigns directed toward important psychological objectives
       and embracing action in these fields as well as the fields of purely psychological activity”.
       It envisages the board as operating as a central authority on political warfare—”as
       recommended by the <persName>Troy</persName> group”.<note n="4" xml:id="d62fn4">See <ref
         target="#d57fn5">footnote 5, Document 57</ref> and <ref target="#d58">Document
        58</ref>.</note></p>
      <p>The <persName>Troy</persName> group, you will recall, was originally given warrant to study
       the problem of defeating Russian jamming of the Voice of America. The group widened its own
       jurisdiction to include the content of the programs to be protected against jamming. The
       group interpreted this widened jurisdiction to include the substance of “political warfare”.
       The group interpreted “political warfare” to include the <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1"
        >Marshall</persName> Plan, Point IV, <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> operations in the
       Far East, and the like. The group referred to political warfare as “inter-connected
       simultaneous use of all instruments of international action”. The group envisaged political
       warfare as the range of activities which, if successful, “will make an all-out shooting war
       impossible for Russia and unnecessary for us”.</p>
      <p>The group then called for an “aggressive” political warfare program instead of the current
       efforts, which the group labeled “defensive”.</p>
      <p>The group discovered a need that “the many elements of our national power, political,
       economic, military,” be “wielded as an integrated effort”. In the group’s phrasing, “We
       therefore urge the unification of political warfare”.</p>
      <p>The group thus called for “some single authority”. This was to have “capacity to design a
       comprehensive program and power to <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0161"/>obtain execution
       of this program”. The authority was to be “concerned with political warfare exclusively”, but
       the phrase, as we have seen, was interpreted to embrace all aspects of foreign policy.</p>
      <p>The <persName>Troy</persName> group went vastly beyond its original terms of reference and
       explored a field for which it had no special competence and about which it had little
       information. In effect it proposed a new board to take over the jurisdiction of all the
       agencies operating in the foreign field, of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>, and in
       part of the President himself.</p>
      <p>I think I have stated sufficiently my misgivings about the <persName>Troy</persName> report
       as a frame of reference for the new board. I have the same misgivings about the reference in
       Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEW1">Barrett</persName>’s memorandum to “the development of
       proposals in the field of military, political and economic action geared for psychological
       effect and to the development of campaigns directed toward important psychological objectives
       and embracing action in these fields as well as fields of purely psychological activity”.</p>
      <p>In my view, if the board were to follow out the implications of the
        <persName>Troy</persName> report and the language cited from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEW1"
        >Barrett</persName>’s memorandum, the result would be a harmful duplication and conflict of
       authority with established agencies and a missing of the potentially very valuable objective
       set up for the board in the establishing directive.</p>
      <p>The board obviously is not intended as a new agency to determine or formulate the ends of
       our foreign policy. Its primary jurisdiction has to do with means of our policy—those means
       devoted directly to affecting the state of mind within the adversary’s camp. I employ the
       word “directly” advisedly. I am aware that all of our policy—ends and means—relates in some
       way to the state of mind in the adversary’s camp. Certain of the means for carrying out that
       policy act indirectly on his state of mind as a collateral effect. I do not believe these
       means fall within the board’s primary jurisdiction. Other means are designed for direct
       effect on that state of mind. These clearly do fall within the board’s primary
       jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>I believe the board should bring about a sharpening of effort in regard to our
       behind-the-iron-curtain information program, our defector program, our covert activities
       within the adversary’s fold, and the like. It should seek to ensure that no opportunity for
       such activities goes unexploited and that the activities are consistent among the various
       agencies carrying them out. When this part of our effort might be helped by a clarification
       of policy or broadening the effort to interpret that policy on some other front, the board
       should be alert to the opportunity to call the matter to the attention of the agency or
       agencies concerned. If the board should undertake to formulate programs “geared for
       psychological effect” in the field of military, political and economic action and “embracing
       action in these fields as well as fields <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133" facs="0162"/>of purely
       psychological activity”, there would be no stopping place short of assuming jurisdiction over
       the whole range of our foreign policy—ends and means.</p>

      <p rend="flushleft">Dear <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>:</p>
      <p>Reference is made to your memorandum of 26 December 1950, transmitting a general statement
       of the support needed by the Central Intelligence Agency (<gloss target="#t_CIA1"
       >CIA</gloss>) from the Department of Defense.<note n="2" xml:id="d64fn2"><ref target="#d36"
         >Document 36</ref>.</note></p>
      <p>The military agencies accept the commitment for furnishing one or two officers each to
        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to aid in the preparation of national intelligence
       estimates.</p>
      <p>Your request for special consideration in obtaining military personnel for use in
       clandestine intelligence and covert operations entails budgetary, personnel and training
       implications which must be considered by the three Services in their manpower plans. If you
       will furnish the Department of Defense with more detailed breakdown with respect to the
       numbers of enlisted and officer personnel desired from each of the Services, the
       qualifications desired in such personnel, and the rate at which you desire they be supplied,
       I will be glad to consider the matter further.</p>
      <p>With respect to the use of certain facilities at Army, Navy and Air Force installations,
       the Joint Chiefs of Staff will welcome discussion of the details of such requirements and be
       receptive to any reasonable demands which will further the national security.</p>
      <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (12 lines) not declassified</hi>]</p>
      <p>The assignment of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> representatives to the military
       staffs in theaters of operations will be dependent upon the relationship between those
       representatives and the theater commanders. This is now under consideration in <gloss
        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/3 proposed by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.<note
        n="3" xml:id="d64fn3">For the draft text of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/3, see
        the attachment to <ref target="#d43">Document 43</ref>.</note></p>
      <p>With reference to your request that you be kept fully informed of operational decisions and
       plans of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I am informed that the policy of the Joint Chiefs of
       Staff on this matter has been transmitted to you in JICM–1205 of 25 September 1950.<note
        n="4" xml:id="d64fn4">Not found.</note></p>
      <p>Permanent liaison between elements of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Joint Chiefs
       of Staff, including a method of furnishing <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0166"/>advice
       and guidance on essential elements of information, appears to be established through frequent
       working-level contacts with the Service intelligence agencies and the representative of the
       Joint Chiefs of Staff on the Intelligence Advisory Committee. Should any deficiencies exist
       under this arrangement, I would appreciate having them brought to my attention.</p>
      <p>As the remaining proposals made in your memorandum will be directly affected by the
       decisions reached with respect to revision of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2 and

      <p>Your memorandum of 28 February 1951,<note n="2" xml:id="d65fn2">Not found.</note> outlining
       the need for specific intelligence and counter-intelligence information on the part of the
       Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference, was handed to us on 22 March 1951 by Major General
        <persName>Bolling</persName>. This Agency realizes that the type of information which you
       describe is becoming more and more necessary and vital to the internal security of the United
       States, appreciates your action in specifying the types of information desired by your
       Committee and welcomes the opportunity to comment on the problem you have presented.</p>
      <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0167"/>
      <p>In our overseas operations our ability to achieve satisfactory results in the fields of
       interest to the <gloss target="#t_IIC1">IIC</gloss> depends in some areas upon obtaining the
       cooperation of local intelligence and security organizations. These local organizations have,
       in varying degrees, useful information on the specific targets listed in your memorandum. We
       could secure more information from these local agencies if we were able, within the limits
       prescribed by the primary requirements of our own security, to work out an exchange of
       information and to furnish them on a basis of reciprocity some information on these subjects
       developed within the United States.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we could more effectively address the work of this Agency to the targets set
       out in your memorandum if there were a closer coordination of the intelligence on Soviet
       controlled espionage activities abroad and the intelligence on such activities in this
       country.</p>
      <p>To this end, the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> would be glad to consider with the
        <gloss target="#t_IIC1">IIC</gloss> agencies the desirability of designating a <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> liaison representative to attend meetings of the <gloss

      <p rend="flushleft">Dear <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>:</p>
      <p>Your memorandum of April 17, 1951,<note n="2" xml:id="d66fn2"><ref target="#d65">Document
         65</ref>.</note> concerning the <gloss target="#t_IIC1">IIC</gloss> need for specific

       Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference.</p>
      <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0168"/>
      <p>It will not be possible for the <gloss target="#t_IIC1">IIC</gloss> agencies to furnish to
       you on a regular basis information of a confidential nature, or that developed from
       confidential sources, for use in bartering with foreign intelligence and security
       organizations. Where there is a specific problem or special circumstances existing, we will,
       of course, be glad to consider any specific requests or suggestions and, where possible,
       information in such cases will be made available for your use in this manner.</p>
      <p>When the <gloss target="#t_IIC1">IIC</gloss> or its Subcommittee is considering a specific
       problem concerning the coordination of domestic intelligence with foreign intelligence
       matters, you will, of course, be invited to designate a representative to attend, as
       contemplated in the <gloss target="#t_IIC1">IIC</gloss> Charter. Generally, however, it is
       felt that the appropriate media for the coordination of the intelligence on Soviet-controlled
       espionage activities abroad and the intelligence on such activities in this country exists in
       the Intelligence Advisory Committee and in the close liaison facilities which are maintained
       with <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.</p>
      <p>The <gloss target="#t_IIC1">IIC</gloss> agencies desire to cooperate with you in any manner
       possible in connection with the obtaining of this vital information, which can for the most
       part only be obtained in the foreign field. As previously indicated, it is most urgent that
       this type of information be developed as its receipt could, when considered in the light of
       domestic problems, possibly be the means of averting serious Communist-controlled Fifth
       Column or sabotage operations within our borders. It will be appreciated if you will furnish
       at your earliest convenience any studies or information which you may presently have in
       connection with the type of information listed in the <gloss target="#t_IIC1">IIC</gloss>

      <p>On Tuesday, May 8, a meeting was called by <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General
        Smith</persName> in <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to discuss plans for the new <gloss
        target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss>. This meeting was attended by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
        >Dulles</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SVARLC1">Admiral Stevens</persName>, <persName
        corresp="#p_MBGJUSA1">General Magruder</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFG1"
        >Wisner</persName> and myself. Minutes of the meeting are being prepared by <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and a copy will be sent to your office in case you would like
       to look at them.<note n="2" xml:id="d67fn2">The minutes have not been found.</note></p>
      <p>No firm recommendations were made as to the substantive problems which the Board should
       attack. <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> expressed the opinion, however,
       that the <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> should have as one of its functions taking high
       policy from <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> and other sources and translating this into
       psychological warfare objectives. <persName corresp="#p_SVARLC1">Admiral Stevens</persName>
       felt that the Board should concern itself largely with use of psychological warfare in the
       cold war and <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> believes it might
       constitute a “general staff” for the cold war.</p>
      <p>At the end of the meeting <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> requested
       that each agency concerned designate two men to draft recommendations for the consideration
       of the Board members. This working group is to address itself to the following questions: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>What kind of a staff will the Board need?</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>How should this staff proceed?</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>What mechanisms are presently available which could be used for the conduct of the
         Board’s business.</item>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item>What should be the initial program of the Board?</item>
       </list></p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> and I registered mild objections to the
       above. We felt that the Board should consume as little time as possible on formal
       consideration of mechanisms, organizational problems, etc.—and certainly should not get
       involved in a lot of formal papers on this subject. Both of us expressed the belief that we
       would like to see the Board get going immediately on certain substantive problems—like our
       over-all strategy with regard to Iran, or overloading the Soviet administrative <pb n="141"
        xml:id="pg_141" facs="0170"/>system. The General seemed to agree in part, but, I gather,
       felt that some minimum organizational planning would be necessary.</p>
      <p>I have asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JP1">Phillips Davison</persName>, Executive
       Secretary of the Psychological Operations Coordinating Board, to represent the Department on
       this working group. He would be accompanied by Mr. <persName>Crutcher</persName> from Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_HCH1">Humelsine</persName>’s office when organizational problems are
       being considered, and by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JP1">Phillips</persName> from this office
       when policy matters are under discussion.</p>
      <p>The first meeting of this working group has been called for next Wednesday.</p>

         <label>a.</label>
         <item>To meet its responsibilities for covert operations, the Central Intelligence Agency
          has already had to increase its personnel and expenditures to an extent believed to exceed

          operations in the summer of 1948.</item>

         <item>Even more considerable increases will be required in the near future if this agency

          (and of which segments are found in various other <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>

         <item>High level policy decisions are required not only on the issue of these increases in

          Chiefs of Staff memorandum to the Director of Central Intelligence, 28 March 1951,<note

       <p>4. Subsequent to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2, the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
         >NSC</gloss> 68 series called for an intensification of covert operations in the fields of
        economic, political and psychological warfare with the purpose of rolling back the perimeter
        of Soviet power and the ultimate frustration of the <persName>Kremlin</persName> design. As
        a result, the covert activities of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> have been stepped up
        considerably, even though the policies established by <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 68
        have never been spelled out in terms of a specific covert program directive to <gloss
         target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.</p>

       <p>7. [<hi rend="italic">7 paragraphs (26 lines) not declassified</hi>]</p>
       <p>8. The above missions, current and proposed, representing a very considerable number of
        covert cold-war projects, constitute in themselves a rather extensive preparation to conduct
        covert operations in support of the military effort in the event of the outbreak of a
        general war. Nevertheless, they do not comprise the comprehensive cold-war program clearly
        contemplated by <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 68. In the absence of a specific
        detailed plan for conducting a comprehensive cold-war program, it is not possible to make an
        accurate estimate of manpower, matériel, and money required. Nor, in the absence of detailed
        overt war plans is it possible to make an accurate estimate of the requirements of
        full-scale covert operational support of an all-out military effort. Nevertheless, it is
        possible, on the basis of the requirements of the programs already under way or in the
        planning stage, to make an informed guess of the general order of magnitude of a covert
        apparatus capable of supporting either an effort to prevent overt war or an all-out military
        effort in the event of such war. [<hi rend="italic">1½ line not declassified</hi>] (These
        estimates exclude additional requirements for military personnel and for funds to stockpile
        and resupply certain standard military items for guerrillas and resistance groups. For
        further detail see Tab “B”.)</p>
       <p>9. Thus, the Central Intelligence Agency is faced with the fact that its covert operations
        are outstripping its present administrative capabilities. Even an apparatus of the magnitude
        required to discharge the relatively limited cold war and military support programs,
        outlined by paragraphs 5 and 7 above, calls for an administrative organization of
        considerably greater strength than now present in <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to
        solve effectively the complex planning and logistical problems involved. Specifically, there
        would be required a staff comparable to that of a Major Command, procurement and production
        machinery for those items not properly assignable to the Department of Defense, and
        additional facilities for: training, security clearances, communications, headquarters
        office space, and other requisite administrative and logistical services. Without such
        augmentation the growing magnitude of covert operations will tend to divert an ever
        increasing share of the time and attention of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> key
        personnel from the basic intelligence mission of the Agency, with the attendant risk that
        such mission will not be adequately accomplished.</p>
       <pb n="146" xml:id="pg_146" facs="0175"/>
       <p>10. Although the cumulation of missions already undertaken by <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
         >CIA</gloss>, to say nothing of those now proposed to <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>,
        may transcend the original intentions of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2, the
         <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 68 series leaves little doubt that it is our national
        policy to conduct covert operations on a very large scale. It is the view of <gloss
         target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> that all of these things can and should be done. But before
        launching <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> into such large activities, a number of high
        level policy decisions and certain vital assurances are required from the National Security
        Council. The following paragraphs deal with the qualitative nature of the required
        guidance.</p>
       <p>11. It appears that the Office of Policy Coordination was originally created to be
        primarily an agency to execute covert support to cold war activities (with planning and
        preparation for covert support in the event of hot war as an additional responsibility).
        However, the increasing scope and pace of hot war preparation is tending to overshadow this
        original purpose. The cold war program (though essentially political in conception) is
        heavily weighted with military considerations; equally, the hot war preparations (though
        essentially military in conception) are heavily weighted with political considerations.
        Because <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>’s present responsibilities cover both current
        cold war covert operations and certain covert aspects of preparations for hot war, it has
        perhaps been more immediately aware than other interested agencies of the need for
        delineation of policies and priorities as between these programs and of the need for more
        definitive machinery to give both programs politico-military guidance on a continuing basis.
        The machinery established under <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2, i.e., the
        designated representatives of the Departments of State and Defense, has consisted of
        individuals of the most exceptional qualifications, who have been of the greatest assistance
        in developing projects. The efforts of these representatives have been augmented by those of
        an equally well qualified and helpful representative of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. However,
        this machinery was not designed to develop strategic guidance of the order required by the
        far-reaching policy determination of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 68 and other
         post-<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2 policy papers.</p>
       <p>12. An illustration of the need for such strategic guidance is the problem raised by the
        view of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as expressed in its memorandum of 28 March 1951, that the
        Central Intelligence Agency should give top priority to preparations for the retardation of
        a Soviet military advance across Europe. The responsibilities of the Director of Central
        Intelligence under <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2 are such that he cannot accept
        this view as controlling without assurance that this military policy will also be consistent
        with the foreign policy of the United States. Only a National Security Council decision can
        give this assurance in a matter of such moment. Such a decision will require a determination
        of relative priorities and of the extent to which the United States is willing to support
        and follow up on counter-revolution in the slave states. Political <pb n="147"
         xml:id="pg_147" facs="0176"/>and matériel support on a national scale is required to back
        up and capitalize on any counter-revolution which may be engendered. Only the National
        Security Council can insure such support.</p>
       <p>13. It is true that the covert apparatus needed for the cold war is similar to that needed
        to support the military effort in a hot war. However, there are numerous important
        differences in detail and in timing. For example, it is clearly desirable from the
        standpoint of either cold war or hot war to develop the potential of resistance groups in
        Eastern Europe. How much of this potential to develop, when to release it, and how much to
        hold in reserve are problems which can be and are argued differently by the military and by
        the political experts. Again <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> must seek politico-military
        guidance at the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> level to determine where and how to
        build and utilize its covert assets.</p>
       <p>14. Another area requiring such guidance pertains to the question of concealing U.S.
        participation in covert activities which cannot remain completely covert. The training of
        indigenous personnel for resistance and guerrilla activity, the mounting of guerrilla
        operations, all become more difficult to cover as the size of the effort increases and the
        time for field operations approaches. [<hi rend="italic">3 lines not declassified</hi>]
        Somewhere in the process it becomes pointless to attempt to deceive the enemy on U.S.
        participation, just as it would have been naive for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
         >U.S.S.R.</gloss> to expect the U.S. to believe it had no part in supporting and directing
        the Greek Communist guerrilla operations. Only continuing guidance from the National
        Security Council level can insure sound decisions in this field.</p>
       <p>15. Finally, it is urged that these matters call for immediate resolution by the National
        Security Council. It requires approximately eighteen months to build the base from which
        all-out covert operations can be launched. The building of the U.S. covert base and
        apparatus is not proceeding at the required pace and cannot until the specific determination
        and guidance discussed above have been issued by the National Security Council.</p>
       <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Conclusions and Recommendations</hi></p>
       <p>16. The above discussion leads to the following conclusions which are stated in the form

         <item>That in view of the magnitude issue as well as the guidance needed to give proper

      <p rend="center">Program Planning for Psychological Warfare</p>
      <p>The National Security Council has directed that in any actual theater of war the Department
       of Defense will be responsible for psychological activities. However, as it is agreed that
       the State Department’s program of International Information and Educational Exchange will be
       called on to assist the military the following steps have been taken: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>An emergency plan has been prepared which covers the necessary general directives for
         providing propaganda activities in the country attacked and in adjacent countries, not only
         for the United States forces which might be involved but for the government under attack.
         While this plan is general, it was drawn with two special countries in view—Iran and
         Yugoslavia.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>A stockpile of necessary basic supplies, including paper, ink, mimeograph, and
         necessary sound equipment is being prepared.</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>A basic stockpile of propaganda output in the form of research materials on various
         subjects that will probably need to be covered in an emergency as well as some
         semi-prepared press releases, pamphlets, leaflets and other similar forms of propaganda is
         being prepared.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>Further, an informal meeting has been held with the British to provide for the beginning of
       active policy and operations liaison.</p>
      <p>In a situation short of actual warfare the State Department is responsible for overt
       propaganda activities. Through the National Psychological Strategy Board we are in constant
       liaison with other agencies in the field. As an acknowledged agency of the United States
       Government we do not engage in activities which will seriously embarrass the government.</p>
      <p>However, recognizing the seriousness of the international situation we began to prepare
       almost two years ago for a vigorous Psychological Offensive. The Offensive has the dual
       purpose of (1) strengthening the alliance of free nations, and (2) weakening the Soviet Union
       and its satellites. We distinguish between the short <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150" facs="0179"
       />term objective in psychological warfare of persuading the enemy to make a false move and
       the longer term objective in our psychological offensive of both encouraging our friends and
       discouraging our enemies.</p>
      <p>In preparation for our special program we prepared a plan known as the Campaign of Truth,
       which contains the following devices to concentrate our efforts on our specialized
       objectives: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>A system of country priorities in which we analyzed propaganda strategy on a global
         basis.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>Country papers which aimed our efforts more precisely by stating: <list>
          <label>a.</label>
          <item>Those propaganda themes or objectives which in each country would best contribute to
           our overall objectives.</item>
          <label>b.</label>
          <item>Target group priorities in which we chose those social classes in each country which
           it was most expedient for us to reach; and</item>
          <label>c.</label>
          <item>Media priorities by which we determined what devices are most effective in each
           country for reaching our target groups.</item>
         </list></item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>Special Propaganda Plans—Special plans spelling out in great detail the psychological
         vulnerability of the peoples and the appeals useful in reaching them, have been prepared
         for Russia, China, Indo-China and the Eastern European satellites and South Asia. Others
         are in process.</item>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item>Guidances—There are four types of guidances used to assure that our operators use the
         most effective messages: <list>
          <label>a.</label>
          <item>The country paper or basic guidance for each area.</item>
          <label>b.</label>
          <item>The overnight guidance which covers day to day events.</item>
          <label>c.</label>
          <item>The weekly guidance which takes care of events of continuing concern; and</item>
          <label>d.</label>
          <item>Special guidances which cover either special propaganda problems or special events
           which lend themselves to propaganda exploitation.</item>
         </list></item>
       </list></p>
      <p>Among the State Department activities which might be pointed to as vigorous implementation
       of the propaganda responsibility of the State Department, I include the following: <list>
        <label>(1)</label>
        <item>Radio—We have two radio stations—<gloss target="#t_RIAS1">RIAS</gloss> in Berlin and
         Red-White-Red in Vienna beaming a strong signal and a hard-hitting message into the Eastern
         European areas constantly. The Radio Division is now constructing studios in Munich in
         addition to increasing the strength of its transmitters and from there will beam still a
         third program into Russia and Eastern Europe soon. The next step calls for a fourth program
         to be beamed out of Salonika to the Near East. The Ring Plan which calls for encircling
         Russia and her satellites with the most powerful radio transmitters ever built, and Project
         Vagabond, in which radio transmitters are mounted on ships, are examples of the <pb n="151"
          xml:id="pg_151" facs="0180"/>new planning of <gloss target="#t_IBD1">IBD</gloss>.<note
          n="2" xml:id="d69fn2">International Broadcasting Division.</note> A further effort to get
         our message into the crucial areas, has already resulted in contracting for radio receivers
         to be distributed in Korea, Indo-China, Greece, Iran and Turkey. The 1952 budget provides
         for further increase of this program. Further, <gloss target="#t_IBD1">IBD</gloss> has
         begun to broadcast in many minority languages of China and Russia, as for example,
         Ukrainian, Georgian, Lithuanian, Amoy, Mandarin, Cantonese and Swatow dialect, as well as
         Urdu and Hindi to South Asia, and is actively working toward programs in Central Asian
         dialects in the very near future.</item>
        <label>(2)</label>
        <item>Press—The major changes under the Campaign of Truth in the press program are that
         regional and local production in not only standard languages but important dialects is
         being stressed and that a great deal of material which is either tied to the local
         interests of the people or is anti-Soviet in character is being produced under the imprint
         of private groups. This is one way in which we have been able to aid organizations
         interested in furthering the same objectives we have.</item>
        <label>(3)</label>
        <item>Motion Pictures—The new developments in the motion picture program are ever-increasing
         emphasis on production in the field, particularly in priority countries and the speeding up
         of the production of a newsreel so that it can become a fast medium for propaganda
         messages.</item>
        <label>(4)</label>
        <item>Exchange of Persons—Priority emphasis worldwide has been given to labor leaders and
         journalists, as labor is a most important target group for us in almost every priority
         country and opinion leaders are also a first priority group. The trend has been away from
         academic exchanges toward political exchanges.</item>
        <label>(5)</label>
        <item>Libraries and Institutes—In addition to more careful selection of types of books and
         languages in the translation program the whole concept of the library has been sharpened
         into that of an Information Center which specializes in books, magazines and exhibits which
         contribute directly to our basic purposes of strengthening ourselves and weakening the
         enemy.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>In policy formulation <gloss target="#t_USIE1">USIE</gloss> plays an active role in the
       Department. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEW1">Barrett</persName> participates in Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_WJE1">Webb</persName>’s meetings. Representatives of the Policy Staff are
       members of working groups on special problems, as for example, the CFM meetings in Paris, the
       Forced Labor issue, the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> information program for which
       we have the responsibility in the United States Government. A special Poly Implementation
       Staff makes news for us to exploit. We help to determine the content of various intelligence
       reports sent out to the missions, and we receive propaganda guidance reports from our
       missions at regular intervals, some daily.</p>
      <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152" facs="0181"/>
      <p>Although the planning for our program began quite some time ago it should be noted that
       little could be done to really effect significant improvement until last October when
       additional funds were granted by the Congress. The Campaign of Truth is dependent on having
       adequate resources.</p>

       has been called on to perform and can anticipate since the approval of <gloss

         >footnote 2, Document 42</ref>.</note> and particularly since the Korean war, requires, in

        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> of its directive to <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
       contained in 10/2. He as much as says that the character of the mission for <gloss

       be recognized by <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>.</p>
      <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0182"/>
      <p>There seems to be no disagreement in the Department or with <persName corresp="#p_MBGJUSA1"
        >General Magruder</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SVARLC1">Admiral Stevens</persName>, or
        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> itself that there is no alternative but to pursue
       vigorously the covert operations and to re-affirm the 10/2 in the light of the changes noted
       by <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">2. Cold War Operations vs. Preparation for Hot
       War</hi></p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> points out the gradual but pronounced
       shift of emphasis in <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> projects from those in support of

       the event of war. This presents to <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> a competing claim upon
       personnel and facilities and <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> requires
       further guidance.</p>
      <p>The Department would join with <persName corresp="#p_MBGJUSA1">General Magruder</persName>
       and <persName corresp="#p_SVARLC1">Admiral Stevens</persName> in believing that we have no
       course but to pursue both objectives simultaneously. However, the Department would feel that,
       in the light of the continuing and understandable pressure from the Military for activities
       in support of a hot war, it is necessary to re-affirm that a fundamental mission of <gloss
        target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> is to promote national policy which has been most recently set
       forth in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>–68 series,<note n="5" xml:id="d70fn5">See
         <ref target="#d5">Document 5</ref>.</note> and that therefore <hi rend="italic"
        >primary</hi> emphasis must be upon the cold war psychological objectives. This would
       include the underlying principle that every effort, including psychological, should be made
       to prevent the coming of a Third World War, while not overlooking the possibility that such a
       war will break out and we will need to be fully prepared for it.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">3. Guidance Mechanism; Support</hi></p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> directly and indirectly inquires
       whether <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> should look to the Psychological Strategy Board
       for guidance and coordination. At the same time he points out that <gloss target="#t_OPC1"
        >OPC</gloss> will not be able to fulfill its mission unless it gets more support in terms of
       personnel and assistance in military and political plans and policies.</p>
      <p>The Department would agree with <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">General Magruder</persName>
       and particularly with <persName corresp="#p_SVARLC1">Admiral Stevens</persName> that the
        <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> was established for just this purpose and it should be
       utilized to the fullest possible extent. The <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> can and
       should be called upon for giving or obtaining from the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
       decision where decision is needed, for giving continual guidance, for coordinating the
       various agencies and for marshalling from the agencies the support required by <gloss
        target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">4. Decision and Guidance on Specific Projects</hi></p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> asks for guidance on a number of

       Notably <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> has pointed out that with
       respect to the problem of support of counter-revolution in the slave states—how much support
       should be given, when to release it, how much reserve to maintain—presents a conflict in
       terms of the objectives of the cold war on the one hand, and of preparation for hot war on
       the other.</p>
      <p>Although <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">General Magruder</persName> does not address this
       point, <persName corresp="#p_SVARLC1">Admiral Stevens</persName> points out, and the
       Department of State would warmly endorse his position, that such problems cannot be answered
       without further plans and proposals by the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and impliedly
       what the issues are as between the conflicting objectives. This and every other project on

      <p><persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>’s memorandum points out that under

        <item>The Director, Central Intelligence is faced by problems created by the cold war in
         which our enemy has the initiative and by the fact <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0185"
         />that our Government as a whole has not adapted itself to the flexibility of action
         demanded in the circumstances. The Departments of State and Defense in the face of swift
         and uninhibited manuevers by the <persName>Kremlin</persName> are still bound by formal
         traditions of political action and conventional war planning as if peace and war were
         absolute conditions. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> alone has been conceived and
         patterned to exercise relative freedom of action in a world situation which is more akin to
         war than peace.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>Nationally we are not mobilized to face the kind of challenge forced upon us by the
          <persName>Kremlin</persName>. That challenge obviously cannot be met by the <gloss
          target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> alone, or by the totality of our so-called psychological
         resources. The Soviets have enlarged the cold war by the coordinated employment actively or
         potentially of all their resources, orthodox as well as unorthodox.</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>The issues raised by the <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> are not administrative or
         jurisdictional. They can be understood only in light of the inflexibility of our
         governmental organization and concepts in facing urgent and unusual requirements. While the
         orthodox departments think and plan too largely in terms of a D–Day that no man can
         predict, we deprive ourselves of full resources in fighting a cold war which might be
         decisive. While our psychological and covert agencies remain a “thin red line of heroes”,
         there is no authoritative agency geared to ensure them mutual and continuous support from
         orthodox national forces.</item>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item>The National Security Council cannot serve as this agency. Nor can it solve the
         problems of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> by any broad statements of principle or
         detailed delineation of functions. The Council can, however, urge expedition in the
         activation of the required agency and ensure its unquestioned authority to solve the major
         issues raised by the <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss>, as well as other varied problems
         yet to be created by the cold war</item>

        <label>6.</label>
        <item><p>In view of the foregoing considerations, the following comments are pertinent to
          the <hi rend="italic">Conclusions and Recommendations</hi> in paragraph 16 of the basic
          paper, by sub-paragraphs as numbered therein:</p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">Sub-paragraph a and b</hi>. It is useless to belabor the question as
          to whether or not <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> should continue to be the agency
          primarily responsible for conducting “covert” operations. This matter has long been
          debated with the same conclusion. The answer should be affirmative for two reasons: one,
          there is no other agency of government which can as logically be assigned the
          responsibility; two, the cold war is on, and the ground lost by any major reorganization
          at this time would be hazardous. The reasonable concern of the <gloss target="#t_DCI1"
           >DCI</gloss> regarding guidance he requires in the stepped-up covert operations can be
          dispelled by the coordination and guidance forthcoming from the Psychological Strategy
          Board which should be expected to make logical distribution of responsibilities in the
          conduct of cold war operations.</p>
         <p>If this statement of the scope and authority of the Psychological Strategy Board should
          be in question, the National Security Council should recommend in unequivocal terms to the
          President an interpretation of his Directive which would establish the validity of the
          concept.</p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">Sub-paragraph c(1)</hi>. Provisions for joint planning with the armed
          forces for covert operations in war time exist in the established procedures for the
          preparation of covert annexes to joint war plans through the mechanism of the Joint
          Subsidiary Plans Division of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington and the Commander’s
          Staff in theaters of operations. Unusual adjustments should be provided in <gloss
           target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> programs.</p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">Sub-paragraph c(2)</hi>. Guidance in the allocation of available
          resources of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> for covert operations as between cold war
          missions and preparations for overt war should be made in the programs promulgated by the
           <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss>.</p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">Sub-paragraph c(3)</hi>. The <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss>
          should have the authority and responsibility for determining the relative weight to be
          ascribed to political and military considerations involved in covert operations, and be
          the arbiter as to whether the operations should or should not be undertaken by <gloss
           target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.</p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">Sub-paragraph c(4)</hi>. The administrative and logistical provisions
          of projects or programs promulgated to operational agencies, including <gloss
           target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, by the <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> should provide
          authoritatively for the necessary supplementary support, if required, in types and
          quantities of personnel, and other administrative and logistical assistance.</p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">Sub-paragraph d</hi>. The guidance herein requested is a normal
          responsibility of the <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> as prescribed in the President’s
          Directive.</p></item>

        <label>7.</label>
        <item>It is probably true that the major departments have looked to <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
          >CIA</gloss> for accomplishments wholly beyond its capabilities, particularly in available
         manpower. Furthermore, the same departments, when requested by <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
          >CIA</gloss> for assistance in supporting its overload, have been loathe to depart from
         administrative rigidity and war mobilization objectives in order to aid <gloss
          target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. The recruitment of types of Americans with talents required
         by the varied operations of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is rendered almost
         impossible by favorable employment conditions in civil life and the absorption of such
         types into the armed forces. It is literally impossible for <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
          >CIA</gloss> to expand operations unduly unless the armed forces make available manpower
         in keeping with the tasks imposed. Decision must be made as to whether the manpower demands
         for war mobilization or cold war operations are to have precedence in a rational division
         of scarce categories of personnel. If it be assumed that the cold war can be won, then it
         is rational to divert manpower for psychological operations at a relatively minor charge
         against orthodox mobilization plans and routine administrative conveniences.</item>
        <label>8.</label>
        <item>Reconsideration should be given to the provision of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
          >NSC</gloss> 10/2 which requires that covert operations be “so planned and executed that
         any U.S. Government responsibility for them is not evident to unauthorized persons and that
         if uncovered the U.S. Government can plausibly disclaim any responsibility for them.” It is
         obvious that the international atmosphere and conditions requiring this highly restrictive
         security provision no longer exist. Publicly announced national policy asserts the
         determination of the Government to fight Soviet aggression wherever it appears and
         implicitly by any means necessary. If for no other reason, the magnitude and variety of
         cold war effort renders the security formula invalid except for <hi rend="italic">genuinely
          covert operations</hi>. Certainly it is not a secret to the enemy that the U.S. Government
         supports unconventional warfare. We should not accept the handicaps of unduly rigid
         security measures respecting para-military types of operations beyond those required to
         obscure our strategy and tactics. The acceptance of this reasoning is important in that it
         facilitates all administrative and logistical steps in combining overt and covert national
         resources in pursuing the cold war.</item>
       </list>
       <p>A clear differentiation can be made between two categories of “covert” operations to the
        first of which the security formula in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2 should
        remain applicable, and to the second of which the formula should be modified. These two

        <item>The action to be taken by the National Security Council on the Central Intelligence
         Agency memorandum of 8 May 1951, “Scope and Pace of Covert Operations,” hinges on the
         acceptance or rejection of two propositions which are implied but not discussed in that
         memorandum. They are: <list>
          <label>a.</label>
          <item>Although global overt war may occur at any time, the possibility that the cold war
           will continue is sufficiently great to warrant a strong effort in the planning and
           conduct of the cold war as well as of a hot war.</item>
          <label>b.</label>
          <item>There is a possibility that by the planned use of all our capabilities, including
           covert ones, we can win the cold war, thereby averting global hot war.</item>
         </list></item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>Acceptance of these two propositions means that we play it both ways, for either war
         or a continuation of the uneasy “peace,” without putting all our eggs in either basket.
         Although there may be differences of opinion as regards the degree of probability of both
         of the two above propositions, there seems to be general agreement as to their validity as
         stated, and consequently as to the desirability of our playing it both ways. This is the
         only course which seems consistent with our intelligence and the national thinking behind
         the great bulk of National Security Council papers in recent years.</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>As a result of past experiences, we are better organized to deal with overt war than
         with the unprecedented situation of a protracted <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0189"
         />all out cold war. The President’s directive of April 4, 1951, establishing the new
         Psychological Strategy Board but requiring maximum use of existing agencies, seems to go
         far towards providing the necessary mechanism. <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> can be
         expected to function not only as a coordinating agency for guidance, but, when it is unable
         to reach decisions and provide guidance itself in the light of approved policy, to
         formulate and recommend in the premises to the National Security Council and the
         President.</item>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item>A decision to play it for both hot war and a continuation of the cold war gives a
         definite answer to the basic question raised by the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
         memorandum. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> should increase the scope and pace of its
         capabilities and action directed towards the winning of the cold war, but should not
         jeopardize its effectiveness for hot war, including planning and preparations therefor by
         so doing. When detailed and specific conflicts in priorities arise, they can and should be
         settled through the Psychological Strategy Board. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is
         also required to insure that its intelligence activities will not suffer by such an
         increase in scope and pace, and its internal arrangements should take this into
         consideration.</item>
        <label>5.</label>
        <item>The extent to which the United States will support and follow up on counter-revolution
         in the slave states, how much of that potential to develop, when to release it, and how
         much to hold in reserve, cannot be answered without the development of more concrete plans
         and proposals to this end. Such plans and proposals are entirely suitable for presentation
         by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to the <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss>, which,
         after study, criticism and coordination, should obtain final decision from the President
         via the National Security Council. The potential forces for counterrevolution may, with
         sufficient time and skill in their development, be capable of eventually providing a final
         solution for the cold war, or, in case hot war intervenes, of raising covert operations
         from a series of minor conspiracies to the stature of a weapon on a par with land, sea and
         air forces.</item>

          <item>Covert operational responsibility should remain as now directed. Although all
           organizational problems are not completely solved, there is no reason to believe that
           they cannot be solved within the existing framework. Moreover, the urgencies of the
           situation will not permit major structural alterations, which would in themselves create
           new problems. Such clarifications of present broad responsibilities as may be essential

        <label>a.</label>
        <item>Personnel and logistic support in short supply and possibly in conflict with other
         projects;</item>
        <label>b.</label>
        <item>Possible conflicts on objectives of the project, particularly as between the cold war

       </list></p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Discussion</hi></p>
      <p>The discussion touched on the following points: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item><hi rend="italic">Personnel</hi>. <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> is experiencing
         serious difficulty in obtaining the necessary personnel to carry out its operations, and
         notably headquarters personnel, most of whom would come from the Military
         Establishment—either regular officers or special call-up of reserves. One estimate of their
         needs called for 50 officers per year, of special qualifications in various areas and
         military specialties.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item><hi rend="italic">Supplies and Stock Piling</hi>. There was no disagreement in the
         responsibility of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to budget for its own supplies, but
         to procure them through the facilities of the Military.</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item><hi rend="italic">Funds</hi>. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> pointed out that to
         date funds were not a limitation upon their effectiveness in carrying out planned projects,
         but rather the limitations were in personnel and logistics.</item>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item><hi rend="italic">Priorities</hi>. It was pointed out that there were three types of
         projects, the allocation of resources to which represented the basic priority difficulty,
         namely: (a) political and psychological targets, purely for the cold war; (b) guerrilla
         operations which could be activated now or in the event of hot war; and (c) development of
         resistance in preparation for hot war. In this connection it was pointed out that any
         cold-war activity would be helpful toward the preparation for hot war, but at the same time
         preoccupation with (b) and (c) above could not help but hurt the effective prosecution of
         (a).</item>
        <pb n="163" xml:id="pg_163" facs="0192"/>
        <label>5.</label>
        <item><hi rend="italic">Potentialities and Risks</hi>. Considerable concern was felt that
         the fulfillment of many of the projects under way might materially increase the risk of
         general war. Obviously the more successful we are in reaching our cold-war objectives of
         containment through strengthening of free-world forces, the more we are risking a general
         war. On the other hand the <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> projects may inherently be
         more provocative than the general factors of success because they are designed positively
         to weaken the potential enemy, and in some cases to cause clashes.</item>
        <label>6.</label>
        <item><hi rend="italic">Psychological Strategy Board</hi>. It was generally felt that the
          <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>, when it becomes operative, will be in a position to
         coordinate the direction given to <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> projects. Two
         important matters in this connection were pointed out: <list>
          <label>a.</label>
          <item>The <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> charter may have to be expanded if it is to
           be effective in insuring <hi rend="italic">the support</hi> as distinct from guidance for
            <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> from the various agencies.</item>
          <label>b.</label>
          <item>Initiative in presenting the issues involved in projects must rest heavily upon
            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, which should identify the various issues and
           conflicting priorities—whether of matériel or objectives—for presentation to the <gloss
            target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> and, where appropriate, the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
            >NSC</gloss>.</item>
         </list></item>
        <label>7.</label>
        <item><hi rend="italic">Scope and Organization</hi>. There was no disagreement that <gloss
          target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> must continue to increase the scope of its activities to
         fulfill the enlarged mission given to it. It was apparent that with possibly minor
         exceptions <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> should continue to have full responsibility
         for all of this type of work.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>In this connection it was pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General
        Smith</persName>’s memorandum was indicative of the growth and success of the <gloss
        target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> operations because it raised such problems as conflicting
       priorities and the effects of successful operations which heretofore have not been necessary
       to raise since all of the effort was going into a build-up. At the same time the memorandum
       indicated the need for <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to put forward full analysis of
       the issues involved in projects in which some decision is necessary and the need for the
       development of such a facility as <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> for the resolution of
       such problems. These problems could not any longer be decided on a blanket and over-all basis
       but would require the specific analysis of the issues in individual projects.</p>

         and existing facilities and arrangements, and a plan for satisfying national needs for such
         intelligence through coordinated inter-agency effort. (National Archives, RG 273, <gloss
          target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Records of Action, Box 1)</note> the Central Intelligence
        Agency has conducted a study of foreign economic intelligence requirements relating to the
        national security and of the facilities and arrangements currently employed for meeting
        those requirements.</item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>As the study has progressed, both the requirements and the facilities and arrangements

        Government.</item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>It is believed that the facilities and arrangements now in effect or contemplated by
        the various agencies will go far toward providing the basis for the adequate coverage of
        economic intelligence relating to the national security whose lack prompted <gloss
         target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action 282. The Central Intelligence Agency itself is engaged
        in strengthening its work in economic intelligence production as a service of common
        concern. The Office of Research and Reports has been established to coordinate the economic
        intelligence activities of other agencies and to produce such economic intelligence as it
        not otherwise allocated.</item>

       <item>For reasons explained in Tab A,<note n="3" xml:id="d73fn3">Memorandum to the
         Intelligence Advisory Committee from the Director of Central Intelligence entitled
         “Proposed Economic Intelligence Committee,” undated, not printed.</note> it is believed
        that it is neither practicable nor desirable to recommend at this time a formal allocation
        by the National Security Council of responsibility for economic intelligence production
        among the various agencies.</item>
       <label>5.</label>
       <item>What is immediately needed is machinery to insure regular procedures whereby (1) the
        full economic knowledge and technical talent available in the Government can be brought to
        bear on specific issues involving the national security, and (2) important gaps in the
        collective economic knowledge of the Government can be identified on a continuing basis and
        responsibility for filling them be allocated as they are disclosed.</item>
       <label>6.</label>
       <item>To meet this need, the Director of Central Intelligence proposes to establish an
        Economic Intelligence Committee. This proposal and the terms of reference of the
         Committee<note n="4" xml:id="d73fn4"><ref target="#d72">Document 72</ref>.</note> described
        in Tab A (tabbed in red) have the concurrence of the members of the Intelligence Advisory
        Committee. To clarify the role of the Central Intelligence Agency in the coordination and
        production of economic intelligence, it is recommended that the National Security Council
        issue the attached proposed <gloss target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss> (Tab B<note n="5"
         xml:id="d73fn5">Not printed. The draft <gloss target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss> is identical

          target="#d254">Document 254</ref>.</note>—also tabbed in red). This proposed <gloss
         target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss> has also received the concurrence of the Intelligence
        Advisory Committee. It would be desirable to invite the Economic Cooperation Administration
        and the Department of Commerce to sit with the National Security Council when this document
        is being considered. Upon the approval of the proposed <gloss target="#t_NSCID1"
         >NSCID</gloss>, the Director of Central Intelligence will establish the Economic
        Intelligence Committee.</item>
       <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0196"/>
       <label>7.</label>
       <item>It is further recommended that the National Security Council call to the attention of
        the relevant agencies of the Government the urgency of a collaborative effort to exploit the
        intelligence resources of the Government for security purposes. A draft of a proposed
        communication from the National Security Council asking that high priority be given to
        requests for cooperation from the Economic Intelligence Committee is attached (Tab C).<note

       <label>8.</label>
       <item>The Director of Central Intelligence will keep under continuing review the arrangements

      <p><persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Walter B. Smith</persName> met this morning with the
       ad hoc committee of the Senior Staff of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> to set forth
       verbally his ideas on the above-mentioned subject. The representatives of the Departments of
       State, Defense and the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> who act as consultants to <gloss
        target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> were also present.<note
        n="2" xml:id="d75fn2">The consultants to the Office of Policy Coordination were <persName
         corresp="#p_JRP1">Joyce</persName> (for the Department of State), <persName
         corresp="#p_MBGJUSA1">Brigadier General John Magruder</persName> (for the Department of
        Defense) and <persName corresp="#p_SVARLC1">Rear Admiral Leslie C. Stevens</persName> (for
        the Joint Chiefs of Staff).</note></p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> started by querying whether it was
       desirable for <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to operate as a sort of “covert War
       Department” for the conduct of large-scale guerrilla operations. He added that para-military,
       large-scale guerrilla operations might go on for a period of years in this present <pb
        n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0198"/>era of the tepid war. He commented that no commander
       should accept responsibility for important missions unless he is assured of receiving proper
       support. He went on to speak of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>’s present support of
       guerrilla warfare on the China Mainland. He stated that it was possible that these operations
       might develop into a very large military effort involving perhaps two or three hundred
       thousand men who would have to be equipped and supplied. If this situation did in fact
       develop it would naturally involve a large production program for specialized light weapons
       and would mean in addition, a large-scale training, shipping and air-supply and re-supply
       program which would amount to a military operation. In other words an “operation of war” on a
       grand scale.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> doubted that the <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> was the proper agency to undertake such a program. He stated
       that our Military Establishment would undoubtedly feel uncomfortable with such an operation
       left to a civilian agency. He added that although the Secretary of Defense and the top
       echelon of the three services might agree with such an operation to be undertaken by the
        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, nevertheless the working levels in the armed services
       would not be prepared to go along and the end result would be that necessary logistic and
       other support would not be forthcoming in a degree which would permit the <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> successfully to fulfill its responsibilities. <persName
        corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> cited several instances whereby support for
        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> in terms of personnel had been agreed to by the
       Secretary of Defense but that long delays and whittling down by the lower echelons of the
       three services had resulted in his obtaining only a minimum of support. For example, the
       Secretary of Defense had agreed that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> should receive from
       400 to 500 officers but that after a period of four months only 40 officers had been supplied
       to the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. He emphasized that the delays in the staff
       echelons and the reluctance to make available qualified personnel had made it virtually
       impossible for the Director of Central Intelligence to meet the requirements which had been
       laid upon him by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> itself. <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1"
        >General Smith</persName> then spoke of the responsibility and authority vested in a theatre
       commander to accomplish certain missions and added that he did not see how the Director of
       Central Intelligence or his representatives could ever obtain in peacetime like authority to
       accomplish missions of great magnitude which had been laid upon the <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss>. He then stated that it might be possible for high ranking and highly competent
       generals loaned to <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to obtain such authority but there
       were very few of these and they were most difficult to obtain from the Military
       Establishment. In other words, available talent in this category was limited.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> went on to say that he, acting on his
       own responsibility, could do and did do certain things in the field of special operations. As
       an illustration he mentioned activities designed to impede the supply of aviation gasoline to
       the Chinese communists which was <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0199"/>presently entering
       the Portuguese port of Macao. He said that an operation of this kind would only require a few
       men and his organization could handle it. On the other hand, however, a large para-military
       support program for anti-communist guerrillas in China is entirely another thing and perhaps
       beyond the capabilities of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> given present dispositions
       and attitudes within the working levels of the Military Establishment.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> went on to say that the major mission
       of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is intelligence and that the operations tail are
       now starting to wag the intelligence dog and that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> was
       already spread very thin. He added that the obtaining of necessary funds was not presently a
       problem as the honeymoon with Congress was still going on. He added, however, that these
       honeymoons never lasted forever and that sooner or later he would probably have to justify to
       the Congress programs and large projects involving the expenditure of several hundred million
       dollars.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> stated that as the Director of
       Central Intelligence it would afford him great relief if he could wrap up in one package this
       whole problem of guerrilla warfare and present it to the military as a military and not a
        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> responsibility. He felt that he must do this for the
       reasons which he had already set forth and unless there should be enthusiastic, timely and
       real support from the Military Establishment which was not presently forthcoming and which he
       did not anticipate. He went on to point out that the military were apparently placing great
       hopes in the so-called retardation project. He feared that these D–Day hopes of what could be
       done were unrealistic and therefore dangerous. He spoke of the large preparations which would
       be required and stated that it had been his experience that by the time an adequate force
       could be equipped and trained it would undoubtedly be penetrated. He mentioned the
       difficulties faced by the French resistance due to enemy penetration and stated that in the
       present case the dangers of communist-penetration were much greater and that whole groups
       which had been painfully prepared might be gobbled up almost instantly when and if D–Day
       came. He emphasized that there was a high degree of wishful thinking and unreality within the
       Military Establishment as to what could be accomplished by special operations in wartime and
       that this was a dangerous situation to be allowed to develop further. He stated that the
       conventional army officer did not understand the enormous difficulties involved due to an
       understandable lack of knowledge of just what guerrilla warfare behind the enemy lines
       involved. He added that there should be a careful auditing of the requirements the military
       were placing upon the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> in this field with a view to there
       being a complete understanding as to the probable capabilities of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss>. This would avoid misunderstandings as well as erroneous military planning
       based on false assumptions.</p>
      <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0200"/>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> stated that, as a minimum, there
       should be joint <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>-military participation in planning and
       operations in order that the military should bear its responsibility for large-scale
       guerrilla operations. This would assure that the necessary support from the military for the
        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> would be forthcoming. He stated that there might be set
       up within the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> a joint staff where <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss> and military officers could plan para-military operations. <persName
        corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> suggested that <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss> specialized personnel might assume responsibility for first contacts with
       underground leaders and guerrilla commanders. The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> might
       even assume the responsibility for providing modest supplies to guerrilla movements in order
       to see how their capabilities develop. If such guerrilla capabilities develop in a large way
       and turn into important military operations, then the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
       responsibility should cease and the military should take over and be charged with the
       responsibilities for supply, re-supply and other logistic support.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_SVARLC1">Admiral Stevens</persName> stated that there was already in
       progress joint planning as between the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and the
       representatives of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and that he considered that this
       situation was working out well. He added that naturally there was a time lag in getting
       projects approved due to the fact that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> had a
       continually clogged agenda. He added that, in his opinion, the military generally speaking
       were trained and held responsible for formal military operations and that they were incapable
       of waging cold war. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">General Magruder</persName> agreed that
       there was insufficient flexibility in the formal Military Establishment or in the formal
       military mind successfully to carry on delicate covert operations where a great deal of
       flexibility and sophistication in political matters was called for.</p>
      <p>It was generally agreed that a great deal of educational work was necessary before the
       military could realize the nature and potentialities of covert operations. It was suggested
       that perhaps the best way for the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to obtain the requisite
       support from the Military Establishment would be for <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">General
        Marshall</persName> to issue orders to the effect that the <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss> operation was a national effort of the greatest importance and that the heads
       of the military services should see to it down the line that it received what it needed to
       have in an expeditious manner as a matter closely related to the national security. There was
       discussion as to whether it might or might not be desirable for the President to issue the
       necessary instructions in order that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> should receive
       unstinted and generous support.</p>

      <p rend="flushleft">Dear <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">General Marshall</persName>:</p>
      <p>I have carefully studied the proposed revision of <gloss target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss>–5
       as prepared by the Joint Chiefs of Staff<note n="2" xml:id="d77fn2">The <gloss
         target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> revision was not found.</note> and have compared it with the
       original directive which it is designed to replace.<note n="3" xml:id="d77fn3">For <gloss
         target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss> No. 5, December 12, 1947, see <ref
         target="frus1945-50Intel#d423"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1945–1950, The
         Emergence of the Intelligence Establishment, Document 423</ref>.</note> The proposal of the
       Joint Chiefs of Staff appears to disregard the intent of Congress as expressed in the
       National Security Act of 1947 and as revealed in the record of Congressional hearings prior
       to the passage of the Act. During these hearings it was made clear that the purpose of
       Congress in enacting the law was to centralize control of clandestine activities abroad. The
       term, “services of common concern,” as finally written into the law was used, among other
       subjects, to cover clandestine espionage operations.</p>
      <p>The proposed revision seems also (see paragraph 1, sub-paragraph a of the draft) to
       disregard the fact that the responsibility of the Director of Central Intelligence is to the
       National Security Council and the President—a status which was reaffirmed recently in the
       President’s handwritten comments on the Joint Chiefs of Staff document proposing revision of
        <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2, which also pertains to this Agency.<note n="4"
        xml:id="d77fn4">Not found.</note> The special operations of this Agency are designed to
       support in every possible way the requirements of the Departments and Services which operate
       under the statutory members of the National Security Council but the channel of
       responsibility to the National Security Council remains clear.</p>
      <p>From the practical point of view, it is unwise to have a number of different authorities
       conducting clandestine operations. When I assumed my present duties, I found that a number of
       Government Departments were operating their own “spy nets” abroad. One or two of these were
       voluntarily transferred to <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> control in accordance with the
       intent of law. Others remain in existence, and we cross trails from time to time; sometimes
       with ludicrous and occasionally with rather tragic results. On the whole, however, this
       multiplicity of control of a very sensitive type of operation is a thoroughly bad business. I
       believe it can be corrected in time by establishing a broader base of confidence and
       cooperation in <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss><pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0204"
       />operations and by improving those operations to the point where they meet the needs of the
       agencies <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is designed to serve.</p>
      <p><gloss target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss>–5 as presently in effect, after stating in
       paragraph 1 that the Director of Central Intelligence shall conduct all organized Federal
       espionage operations outside the United States and its possessions for the collection of
       foreign intelligence information required to meet the needs of all Departments and Agencies
       concerned in connection with the national security, makes exception “for certain agreed
       activities by other Departments and Agencies.” I am prepared at any time to discuss any such
       activities proposed by other Departments and Agencies and to endeavor to reach an agreement
       with respect to them. Furthermore, I am obligated under paragraph 4 of <gloss
        target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss>–5 to coordinate such agreed activities of “casual agents”
       with the organized covert activities.</p>
      <p>I wish to make it clear that this Agency is entirely willing to place its personnel under
       the American theater commander in any theater of active military operations where American
       troops are engaged and is equally willing, and indeed anxious, to coordinate its activities
       with the Joint Chiefs of Staff. If it is necessary to formalize this attitude, a brief
       statement like that embodied in the recently approved revision of paragraph 4, <gloss
        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2,<note n="5" xml:id="d77fn5">See <ref target="#d38fn2"
         >footnote 2, Document 38</ref>.</note> should be sufficient. Accordingly, I do not believe
       that the proposed revision merits consideration by the National Security Council. The present
       directive seems quite adequate.</p>

          <item>Protection of critical governmental, industrial, port and other installations and
           facilities.</item>

        <item>A summary of the progress made to date under items a. to h. above follows: <list>
          <label>a.</label>
          <item><p>(1) A study, in two parts, covering industrial security, was submitted to the
             <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> which approved its recommendations. As a
            consequence thereof, an Industry Evaluation Board and a Facilities Protection <pb
             n="179" xml:id="pg_179" facs="0208"/>Board have been established; the former under the
            Secretary of Commerce and the latter, while administered by the Department of Commerce,
            responsible to the <gloss target="#t_ICIS1">ICIS</gloss>. The functions of these boards
            are to evaluate industrial plant and related resources; to assign to the appropriate
            departments and agencies of government the responsibility for preparation and
            supervision of security programs; to establish overall protection policies; to insure
            the preparation of detailed plans by each agency in its area of responsibility; and to
            review and monitor the implementation of such plans.</p>
           <p>(2) A plan for the protection of government buildings, prepared by the General
            Services Administration, is currently awaiting final <gloss target="#t_ICIS1"
             >ICIS</gloss> approval.</p>
           <p>(3) A study on port security submitted to the Treasury Department has resulted in the
            preparation of a detailed plan for augmenting Coast Guard activities in this respect.
            The plan has been approved and is currently being implemented.</p></item>
          <label>b.</label>
          <item>Several studies have been prepared and approved covering possible preventive
           measures against unconventional attack. Some thirty-five (35) studies by various
           departments and agencies have been submitted to <gloss target="#t_ICIS1">ICIS</gloss>
           covering the vulnerability of their respective areas of responsibility. A study proposing
           that an overall intelligence evaluation be prepared by <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
            >CIA</gloss>, utilizing the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> agencies, has been
           submitted to, and is under consideration by, the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>.
           Such an evaluation is essential upon which to predicate the degree of implementation not
           only of protective measures against unconventional attack but also should prove
           invaluable in the consideration of defense measures against all forms of covert and overt
           attack.</item>
          <label>c.</label>
          <item><p>(1) Comprehensive reports covering entry and exit safeguards have been prepared
            and approved by <gloss target="#t_ICIS1">ICIS</gloss>. Their provisions and
            recommendations for strengthening controls have been referred to and are being
            implemented by the responsible agencies such as the Immigration and Naturalization
            Service (Justice), Visa and Passport Divisions (State), Customs (Treasury).</p>
           <p>(2) The “Wartime Regulations Covering Entry and Exit” have been completely revised and
            redrafted, and are currently being circulated by State Department to all interested
            departments and agencies for concurrence.</p></item>
          <label>d.</label>
          <item><p>(1) A detailed study covering the means of clandestine introduction of
            unconventional attack media and other materials. Predicated upon its conclusions,
            recommendations have been made to the Bureau of Customs and other agencies for the
            augmentation of already existing machinery for detection and prevention of entry.</p>
           <p>(2) The authority to control the export of strategic materials is vested in the
            Secretary of Commerce. The determination of what <pb n="180" xml:id="pg_180" facs="0209"
            />materials are strategic or which for reasons of economics, etc., should not, in the
            interest of national security, be exported is not within the purview of <gloss
             target="#t_ICIS1">ICIS</gloss>.</p>
           <p>(3) The control of export of unclassified, published technological information to the
            Soviet bloc has, at the request of the Secretary of Commerce, been actively studied and
            interim recommendations made. No final solution to this extremely complex problem has
            been devised. Special emphasis is currently being placed on finding a
           solution.</p></item>
          <label>e.</label>
          <item><p>(1) Regulations establishing “Minimum Standards for the Handling and Transmission
            of Classified Government Information” have been submitted to, and approved by, the
             <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> and the President, contingent upon the resolution
            of the provisions of a single paragraph thereof by the Department of Justice and the
            Department of Defense.</p>
           <p>(2) Regulations establishing “Minimum Standards for Security Clearance for Access to
            Classified Government Information” have been submitted to and approved by the <gloss
             target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> and the President who has directed their publication
            concurrently with, or immediately following, the publication of the regulations referred
            to in (1) above.</p>
           <p>(3) Regulations prescribing security procedures to determine the eligibility of
            foreign visitors to have access to classified U.S. Government information have been
            submitted to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> and are currently under
            consideration by it.</p></item>
          <label>f.</label>
          <item>A study was prepared by the <gloss target="#t_ICIS1">ICIS</gloss> which has led to
           the establishment of an agency in the Department of Commerce to provide advice and
           guidance in this field to state and local authorities and to private business.
           Appropriate liaison has been established in all departments and agencies concerned
           whereby recommendations are made as to the guidance to be given regarding the specific
           matters coming under their respective jurisdictions. Appropriate publicity has been given
           this project, and it is now functioning.</item>
          <label>g.</label>
          <item>This is a general problem which is receiving continuing consideration. In applying
           the principle it is usually determined that specific measures fall under one of the
           categories listed in a. through f. above and progress thereunder has been discussed
           previously.</item>
          <label>h.</label>
          <item>This also is a general problem of a continuing and varied nature. In addition to
           generating such regulations, for example, as shown in e. above, the <gloss
            target="#t_ICIS1">ICIS</gloss> reviews proposed regulations and legislation originating
           in various departments and agencies with a view to evaluating and recommending the
           resolution of differences pertaining to the interests and requirements of other agencies.
           Since the various departments and agencies of the executive branch have become more and
           more cognizant of the coordinative function of <gloss target="#t_ICIS1">ICIS</gloss>, the
           effectiveness of its efforts in this area of interest has improved.</item>
         </list></item>
        <pb n="181" xml:id="pg_181" facs="0210"/>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>There has been almost unqualified cooperation by the various departments and agencies
         in support of <gloss target="#t_ICIS1">ICIS</gloss> activities. However, many of the
         programs and projects advocated by the <gloss target="#t_ICIS1">ICIS</gloss> for
         implementation by these agencies have met with the obstacle of lack of funds. For example,
         the Department of Commerce has found it difficult to provide for the essential staff and
         administrative cost of the Industry Evaluation Board and the Facilities Protection Board.
         Agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission are finding it difficult to
         undertake even the planning for physical security of the communications industry. Once such
         plans are completed the cost of supervision and enforcement of protective measures will be
         an additional obstacle. As a further example, plans for removing subversives from critical
         plants and facilities must provide, not only for security checks of employees which is of
         itself an expensive procedure, but also for the equally important protection of the rights
         of individuals through hearings and appeals procedures. The latter will doubtless entail
         the establishment of regional appeals boards across the country, probably under the
         jurisdiction of the Department of Labor. That Department consequently must be provided the
         funds for their establishment and functioning. Plans are not yet crystalized to the degree
         that specific costs can be estimated but it is anticipated that impediments and
         difficulties of this nature will be encountered.</item>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item>The program, as outlined, is considered adequate. Additional specific problems under
         the broad outline are constantly arising and are being incorporated thereunder for active
         consideration. The entire program is an immediate one, and the corrective actions
         determined to be necessary are being implemented on an urgent basis as soon as the
         requirement is established. Those measures which are earmarked for implementation only in
         the event of general hostilities nevertheless are envisaged as being equally urgent for
         determination as those which are required to be implemented currently.</item>
        <label>5.</label>

       <item>The <gloss target="#t_ICIS1">ICIS</gloss> report considers Soviet capabilities, Soviet
        intentions, and U.S. plans for the internal security of the United States. It suggests the
        need for further coordination and integration of such matters. The draft directive proposed
        in the report, addressed to the Director of Central Intelligence as Chairman, Intelligence
        Advisory Committee (<gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss>), is intended to remedy these
        inadequacies by establishing a project to develop a comprehensive appraisal of Soviet
        capabilities to injure the continental United States. The draft directive contemplates
        further that key Defense Department personnel be assigned to the project full time for an
        estimated period of six months and examination by the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> of
        certain aspects of United States military war plans.</item>

       <item>Procedures now in effect, whereby members of the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss>
        provide information and advice to the Director of Central Intelligence, assure assistance in

        Accordingly, such intelligence as is required for the project is available through normal

       <label>5.</label>
       <item>In view of the above, it is believed that the enclosed draft directives provide a more
        satisfactory means of accomplishing the purposes of the project than the one proposed in the

      <p>Before leaving on my vacation I want to set down my views in relation to developments
       concerning the Psychological Strategy Board.</p>
      <list>
       <label>1.</label>
       <item>The Presidential Directive of April 4, 1951,<note n="2" xml:id="d81fn2">see <ref
          target="#d60">Document 60</ref>.</note> is somewhat unclear in setting forth the scope of

         <label>a.</label>
         <item>Refers to psychological objectives, strategy and operations without precisely
          delimiting the meaning of “psychological.”</item>

          the inclusion is definitive or illustrative.</item>
         <label>c.</label>
         <item>Vests the Board with power to “formulate policy” in respect to psychological
          activities without defining the relationship between such policy and the national foreign
          policy.</item>
        </list></item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>In the efforts to get the Psychological Board operating two general approaches to the
        question of the Board’s purpose and jurisdiction have developed— <list>
         <label>a.</label>
         <item>The first is generally advocated for by members of <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
           >CIA</gloss> active in the initial phases of the Board’s work. It is that the Board has
          primary authority with regard to all matters of the conduct of foreign policy short of
          formal hostilities.</item>
         <label>b.</label>
         <item>The second represents the viewpoint of the Department of State and has support from
          the military. It is that the Psychological Strategy Board should exercise— <list>
           <label>(1)</label>
           <item>Primary authority in ensuring among all agencies concerned maximum effectiveness
            and unity of objective and effort in regard to activities set forth in <gloss
             target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 59/1 and 10/2.</item>
           <label>(2)</label>
           <item>Secondary authority to see that full account of psychological factors—that is,
            aspects having impact on the mind, will, and morale of foreign peoples—is taken in the
            planning and execution of other activities bearing on the field of foreign relations,
            including the planning of the national objectives themselves.</item>
          </list></item>
        </list></item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>These two points of view have been made apparent in all critical stages of the efforts
        to establish the understandings and the organizational arrangements to get the Board’s work
        under way. To clear <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0216"/>the matter up, the Director of
        the Board<note n="5" xml:id="d81fn5"><persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gordon
         Gray</persName>.</note> sought to bring about an agreed definition of psychological
        operations as concerned in the Board’s jurisdiction. This effort produced two drafts which
        typify the conflicting approaches: <list>
         <label>a.</label>
         <item><p>The first representing the radically broad concept of the Board’s scope is:</p>
          <p>“Psychological operations,” as used in the President’s directive, is a cover name to
           describe those activities of the United States in peace and in war through which all
           elements of national power are systematically brought to bear on other nations for the
           attainment of U.S. foreign policy objectives.</p></item>
         <label>b.</label>
         <item><p>The second, representing the more restricted view, is:</p>
          <p>Psychological operations are interpreted within the terms of the Presidential Directive
           of 4 April 1951 to consist of activities designed to influence the attitudes, actions and
           capabilities of foreign peoples, so as to further U.S. national objectives.</p>
          <p>The role of <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> is: <list>
            <label>a.</label>
            <item>To formulate basic plans for the systematic employment of those psychological
             operations encompassed by <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 59/1 and <gloss
              target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2, to coordinate their execution, and to evaluate
             their effect.</item>
            <label>b.</label>
            <item>To ensure in the formulation and application of national political, economic and
             military policies, that the symbolic and psychological aspects thereof are adequately
             exploited.</item>
           </list></p></item>
        </list>
        <p>In face of the prospect that the two definitions were irreconcilable, the Director
         decided to lay aside the effort to remedy the issue by definition and to concentrate
         instead on particular problems and the creation of a staff.</p></item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item>It is necessary and desirable, however, to clear up in the beginning the difference as
        to the Board’s purpose and jurisdiction and to resolve the issue by adopting the narrower
        concept. This is based on the following considerations: <list>
         <label>a.</label>
         <item>It would be counter to the interests of the Board and to the Government in general to
          have friction develop between the Board and other agencies concerned over conflicting
          assumptions about authority. The principle that good fences make good neighbors is just as
          important in Government as it is anywhere else.</item>
         <label>b.</label>
         <item>Clarity of view as to purpose and function is desirable not only to avoid
          jurisdictional conflicts at the top level but also to develop harmonious collaboration in
          day-to-day relationships at all levels.</item>
         <label>c.</label>
         <item>Clarification is necessary in order to clear the way for going ahead with planning
          the Board’s work. In laying out the work it is necessary to know not only what the Board’s
          and its Staff’s problems will be but also to what relationship to the problems the Board
          and its Staff will have. Under the radically broad definition, any problem might be
          expounded by inference to cover the sum total of national policy. To <pb n="188"
           xml:id="pg_188" facs="0217"/>make particular problems manageable, it is necessary to
          relate them to some restriction in basic concept. It would prove vexatious to everyone
          concerned if the Board and its Staff were to commence their labors without some clear view
          as to goal and limits.</item>
         <label>d.</label>
         <item>It is well to confine the Board to a commitment which it can fulfill and which will
          make it most useful to the Government rather than attempting to fulfill a vast
          responsibility all too likely to result in duplication, conflict, and frustration running
          counter to the Board’s usefulness.</item>
        </list></item>

       <item>In the discussions of the organizational problem the Director and some of his immediate
        assistants have repeatedly stressed that a premium will be placed on staffing the
        organization with individuals from outside the Government service. This may be desirable in
        avoiding the draining away of talents needed in other agencies and in widening the sum of
        capabilities available to the Government. At the same time, the idea can be pushed too far.
        A unit composed preponderantly of individuals unfamiliar with the labyrinthine ways of the
        Government would all too likely find itself unable to make headway. It would find itself
        frustrated in trying to get its own work done. Others would find it getting in the way. It
        is better therefore that a balance be struck between new resources of imagination and old
        wisdom in the ways of the Government.</item>

      <p>1. In addition to his statement in <hi rend="italic">Progress Report by the Director</hi>
        (<gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> D–1),<note n="2" xml:id="d82fn2">A copy is in the

       Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> commented that efforts are being made to
       recruit individuals for permanent appointment to the staff of the Psychological Strategy
       Board (<gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss>). He noted that Task Panel “A” (<gloss
        target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> D–1/1)<note n="3" xml:id="d82fn3">A copy is ibid.</note> was
       the outgrowth of a meeting at the White House in which Assistant Secretaries of State
        <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BEW1"
        >Barrett</persName> had participated.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Procedure for Conduct of Board Business</hi></p>
      <p>2. The Board agreed that it would meet only when there are important problems to discuss.
       The Acting Chairman and the Director will schedule meetings on a rotation basis at any one of
       the three Agencies at the convenience of the Board. The members are free to bring their
       alternates as they deem desirable.</p>
      <p>3. In the matter of briefing, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> suggested that
       his staff brief the members’ alternates a few days before meetings of the Board. The
       alternates would then brief the members in advance of Board meetings. <persName
        corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LRA1"
        >Lovett</persName> favored this procedure. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LRA1">Lovett</persName>
       urged that papers be held to a minimum for security reasons. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJE1"
        >Webb</persName> stated that he had not decided how to handle the briefing problem.</p>
      <pb n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0219"/>
      <p>4. To prevent problems being placed before the Board for decision until the members have
       had a chance to study them, it was the consensus that the Director should determine whether a
       problem is within the competence of the Board and whether it is necessary for the <gloss
        target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> staff to present its views to the <gloss target="#t_PSB1"
        >PSB</gloss>.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">List of Problems of Interest to the Board (<gloss
         target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> D–2)<note n="4" xml:id="d82fn4">Not found.</note></hi></p>
      <p>5. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>, in presenting his views on <hi
        rend="italic">List of Problems for the Director and Staff in Order to Work Priority</hi>
        (<gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> D–2), called the Board’s attention to paragraph 4 in
       which he states his concern that the Board should not assume too many problems without
       careful consideration. He said this document is an effort to translate <gloss
        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> papers into action. It is necessary to convert <gloss
        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policies into specific objectives and formulate plans which
       will achieve these objectives. As the problems listed in Sections II–A, II–B and II–C on page
       2 are solved, the remaining problems will become clearer. The staff intends to give top
       priority to the substantive problems I through II–C which fall generally into a category of
       psychological strategy planning not previously initiated. Section II–D will then be
       considered. Section II–E will be considered concurrently inasmuch as these problems are
       largely concerned with relationships. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>
       explained that it is not necessary to reconcile differing definitions as to what
       psychological operations mean because the same work is necessary under either concept.
       Consequently, it was decided to list the problems facing the <gloss target="#t_PSB1"
        >PSB</gloss> to provide the Board with specific terms of reference which would enable it to
       get on with its work. Therefore, the list of problems (<gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss>
       D–2) illustrates the area of interest of the <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> and the
       Staff. At the same time it provides for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> the
       basis for planning a functioning staff organization.</p>
      <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> said that the list of problems
       appears to be monumental. He asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> how he
       expected to accomplish these projects and still attack current problems. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> replied that the Staff intends to use ad hoc groups
       whenever necessary on new problems. <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>
       said that in his opinion the <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> staff would require many
       reinforcements to accomplish the work outlined in <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> D–2. He
       believed that completion of the problems listed would require two years of effort by the
        <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> staff and that there was not that much time available.
       He said that the problems listed in Sections I–A (4), I–A (5), and I–A (7) are enough to keep
       the <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> staff busy for quite some time. In addition, as he
       looked over the list of problems, it appeared that many others were going to require work by
       the staff in the very near future. He noted, as an example, that the problem in Section II–K
       had not yet <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0220"/>been assigned a work priority. However,
       it is a problem which must be met right now.</p>
      <p>7. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJE1">Webb</persName> said that the
        <persName>Kremlin</persName> has a special group which devotes all of its efforts to
       maximizing the strength of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and to fractionating and
       weakening that of the United States. He hoped that the members would conceive the function of
       the <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> as drawing together U.S. efforts in the same way as
       the <persName>Kremlin</persName> group does for Russia. Moreover, he believed the Board
       should discuss further many of the problems listed in <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> D–2
       before the Staff completes its work and reaches a final position on the problems. He said
       surveys take time and that we should not overlook each Board member’s ignorance of the work
       of other agencies. He looked upon the <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> as a central place
       for the members to meet, discuss problems and make policy. The <gloss target="#t_PSB1"
        >PSB</gloss> should be a central place where guidance would be available. It would give Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_WJE1">Webb</persName> the feeling that here is a group of knowledgable
       Government Officials who can meet our major problems in the psychological area.</p>
      <p>8. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LRA1">Lovett</persName> said that this list is an encyclopedic
       approach and gives the Board something to shoot at. He suggested that the Board approve the
       document (<gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> D–2) as an identification of problems which
       call for discrimination as to which should be undertaken first. He suggested that the Board
       undertake as a matter of urgency the problems listed in Section I–A (4), I–A (5) and I–A (7).
       This will enable the Board to find out what is being done by Government agencies, what
       general directives they are following and what they plan to do. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_WJE1">Webb</persName> agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LRA1"
        >Lovett</persName> and said that if these three problems were worked out, the <gloss
        target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> would then know what the agencies in the U.S. Government are
       working on. It could bring together whatever additional resources are necessary to achieve
       our goals and could make the necessary plans for any gaps which might be found to exist.
        <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> agreed with: a) the above, b) that the
       staff of the Board should undertake the necessary work in connection with these three points;
       and c) that the Board should consider at a later date the other problems listed in the
       document. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> said that the list will naturally be
       subject to constant revision. He suggested that the staff, in addition to the study of
       Sections I–A (4), I–A (5) and I–A (7), be allowed to take up any urgent matter which the
       Board might direct.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Section II–D of <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss>
        D–2</hi></p>
      <p>9. The Board discussed at length the problem stated in this section of the paper. It was
       the consensus of the Board that the Russians are planning some disruptive action to embarrass
       us. Possibly they will reaffirm their disarmament suggestions and intensify their peace
       drive. It will have the same old sugar coating and will attempt to show that the United
       States is preventing disarmament in the world. The <persName>Shvernik</persName>
       <pb n="192" xml:id="pg_192" facs="0221"/>letter possibly gives a guide to the Russian
       attitude. No doubt the Russians will say to small countries “if you don’t go along with us
       and accept our position, you must bear the consequences.” The Board agreed that the United
       States must take action to meet these Russian maneuvers both abroad and in the United
       States.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Section II–E of <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss>
        D–2</hi></p>
      <p>10. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> said that he planned to have a Special
       Assistant handle the relationships of <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> with congressmen
       and representatives of private agencies who are interested generally in psychological
       developments. He does not anticipate any problems in this connection. The main thing will be
       to keep others from doing things we don’t want them to do rather than the need to encourage
       cooperation by outsiders. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJE1">Webb</persName> asked Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> if he intended to use other executive agencies of the
       Government to talk to representatives of private groups. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1"
        >Gray</persName> said that he would use Government agencies but that it would be necessary
       to have someone available in <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> to talk with them so that
       they feel they are being given consideration. <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General
        Smith</persName> believed it would be desirable for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1"
        >Gray</persName> to have such an officer to deal with interested private agencies. Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_LRA1">Lovett</persName> said that the Department of Defense would
       handle most inquiries itself but that it would push off general inquiries to the <gloss
        target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss>. It was the consensus of the Board that the procedure outlined
       by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LRA1">Lovett</persName> should be followed.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Organization, Functions, and Budget (<gloss
         target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> D–3)<note n="5" xml:id="d82fn5">Not found.</note></hi></p>
      <p>11. The Board’s consideration was limited to page 5 of <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss>
       document D–3. In explaining this estimate, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>
       said that he expects that the staff will be increased somewhat to meet the problems the
        <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> must handle. However, he believed that any increase
       would be reasonable and in no case would the staff be increased to anywhere near double the
       size called for in the document. The Board agreed that the necessary funds would be provided
       from appropriate Agency budgets.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Other Business</hi></p>
      <p>12. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> discussed two papers as examples of
       problems which contain psychological implications. He asked that the members caution their
       Agencies to make available to the <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> copies of paper of
       importance to the work of the Board and its Staff. The members agreed that they would
       instruct their agencies to cooperate in this matter.</p>
      <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> discussed the question of
       preventing uncontrolled activity in the psychological field now that the <gloss
        target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> has been organized. He said that there is a need to develop an
       over-all psychological <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0222"/>strategy plan. Other Agencies
       and the Army, which is concerned only with the tactical military phase of operations, would
       then be able to carry out assigned missions. <persName corresp="#p_MBGJUSA1">General
        Magruder</persName> stated that he would discuss the Army’s role with Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_LRA1">Lovett</persName> (who had left the meeting) and that the Department of
       Defense would handle the matter internally. He said that the Services would deal with the
       Board through the <gloss target="#t_JSPD1">JSPD</gloss> which was established for this
       purpose. <persName corresp="#p_MBGJUSA1">General Magruder</persName> said that two papers are
       being prepared concerning the Army’s interpretation of its function and that copies will be
       submitted to the <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss>. It was the consensus that an over-all
       psychological strategy plan should be developed so that all activity in the Government is in
       consonance with it.</p>

        >Wisner</persName> (<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>).</p>
      <p>In the outset of the meeting it became evident that the majority if not all of those
       present considered the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> memorandum to be confusing and
       obscure. Numerous questions were addressed to Admiral <persName>Wooldridge</persName> in the
       effort to obtain clarifications of various points in the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
       paper. For example, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName> stated and others agreed
       that they could not understand the intent of the changes made by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
        >JCS</gloss> paper <pb n="199" xml:id="pg_199" facs="0228"/>in paragraph 1c of the <gloss
        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Staff paper. These changes propose the deletion of the words
       “facilitate covert and guerrilla operations” and the substitution of “provide assistance to
       underground resistance movements and guerrillas”; and the deletion of the words “insure
       availability of these forces in the event of war” and the substitution of “to provide <hi
        rend="italic">the base</hi> upon which the military may expand these forces on a military
       basis in time of war within activated theaters of operation”. It was concluded that the
       original language should remain unchanged in the absence of any clear reason for changing it.
       However it was agreed to add the following language to the end of the original paragraph 1c:
        <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“… insure availability of these forces in the event of war for <hi rend="italic"
          >utilization in accordance with principles established by the National Security Council,
          including wherever practicable provision of a base upon which the military may expand

         (underscored language added)<note n="4" xml:id="d85fn4">Printed here as italics.</note></p>
       </quote></p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NFC1">Nash</persName> proceeded to analyze the <gloss
        target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> memorandum and made the point that the paper in its entire
       latter portions dealt with matters which were not suitable for inclusion in an <gloss
        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper but which should be the subject matter of internal
       Defense Department determination and disposition. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NFC1"
        >Nash</persName> recommended that the attention of the meeting be focused on the forepart of
       the paper to the exclusion of the very detailed administrative provisions of the latter
       paragraphs. It was agreed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NFC1">Nash</persName>’s
       recommendation was sound and that the latter paragraphs of the paper should be the subject of
       consideration and decision within the Department of Defense and the military services.
       Presumably there would be an opportunity for <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to
       participate in the deliberations leading to the development of the Defense Department
       position and papers covering the administrative provisions.</p>
      <p>Admiral <persName>Wooldridge</persName> urged on behalf of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
        >JCS</gloss> that two changes be made in the paper in order to take into account and
       adequately reflect the points of chief concern to the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. He
       proposed the addition of a new paragraph 2 in the paper to read as follows: <quote
        rend="blockquote">
        <p>“Direct the Psychological Strategy Board to assure that its strategic concept for a
         national psychological program includes provision for covert operations designed to achieve
         the objectives stated in paragraph 1 above.”</p>
       </quote></p>
      <p>It was agreed to adopt this paragraph in order to make manifest within the paper the
       responsibility of the Psychological Strategy Board for insuring that the specified objectives
       should be provided for in the strategic plan which it is required to develop under the
       directive which <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0229"/>sets up the <gloss target="#t_PSB1"
        >PSB</gloss>. It was understood that nothing in the new paragraph would require the
       submission to and approval by the <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> of existing programs
       and activities of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> in order for these to proceed or
       obtain the necessary support of the Defense establishment.</p>
      <p>Admiral <persName>Wooldridge</persName>’s other point was that paragraph 2c should be
       changed to provide that the <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> would coordinate the
       provision of personnel, funds and other support to the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> by
       the Departments of State and Defense, rather than <hi rend="italic">insure</hi> the provision
       of such support. Admiral <persName>Wooldridge</persName> contended that the <gloss
        target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> as such had no authority to “insure” the provision of support
       by the other departments. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JWH1">Jackson</persName> while
       acknowledging the technical accuracy of Admiral <persName>Wooldridge</persName>’s point
       nevertheless maintained that the assurance of support for the <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss> was essential from the point of view of the Director of <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss>, and that whatever words might be added it should be very clear that the <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> should not be called upon to execute programs without the
       assurance that the necessary support would be forthcoming. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JWH1"
        >Jackson</persName>’s position was fully supported by all present at the meeting and it was
       agreed to adopt the following language to give expression to the technical point raised by
       Admiral <persName>Wooldridge</persName>: <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“Coordinating action to insure the provision of adequate personnel …”—continues as
         original.</p>
       </quote></p>
      <p>There being no other points offered or suggested by Admiral <persName>Wooldridge</persName>
       or any others at the meeting, it was agreed that the above indicated changes would be all
       that were necessary. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NFC1">Nash</persName> indicated that he would
       recommend to the Secretary of Defense that the latter send forward to Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName> a statement to the effect that the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
        >NSC</gloss> Senior Staff paper is approved by the Department of Defense subject only to the
       three indicated changes in language.</p>

      <p><hi rend="italic">History of the Organization</hi>. The Office of Special Operations is a
       direct carry-over from the Office of Strategic Services. When that organization was disbanded
       at the end of the war, the Secret Intelligence Branch and the X–2 Branch (Counterespionage)
       were retained as the Strategic Services Unit under the Office of the Assistant Secretary of
       War. When the President created the Central Intelligence Group in January 1946, the Strategic
       Services Unit was transferred to that organization and became the Office of Special
       Operations.</p>
      <p>Principal assets brought forward from <gloss target="#t_OSS1">OSS</gloss> days included
       some experienced personnel; the nucleus of organizations operating principally in Germany and
       China; the counterespionage files of <gloss target="#t_OSS1">OSS</gloss>; and established
       liaisons with certain foreign intelligence services. While the organization in China has been
       largely destroyed by the Communists, the organization in Germany has been developed and
       expanded. Inherited after the conclusion of World War II was the responsibility for coverage
       of Latin America, previously held by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
      <p>Today the Office of Special Operations is organized into seven foreign divisions operating
       131 fixed field stations, three principal staffs and six subordinate staffs. [<hi

         infiltrate agents into the Soviet Union, but, given stringent Soviet controls, these
         attempts, codenamed Redsox, enjoyed very limited success. This was recognized by 1954 and a
         program using legal travelers for short term observation of the Soviet Union was set up
         under the codename Redskin.</note></item>

        with an intelligence detachment. Actually <gloss target="#t_OSO1">OSO</gloss> does not have

        <p>Under this project, thirty of the nation’s top scientists and other experts were
         assembled by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under contract to the Department of
         State to explore all conventional and unconventional means of penetrating the Iron Curtain.
         Particular attention was given to the possibilities of utilizing in psychological warfare
         the new developments in the electro-magnetic field. The report submitted by the group calls
         for a substantial expansion of our radio facilities, which has already been undertaken. A
         vest-pocket radio is being developed along the lines recommended by the group, making use
         of the “transistor,” a remarkable device which increases battery-life several hundred times
         and makes it possible to build a radio set of this size.</p>
        <p>Funds to complete the project, although requested, have not been appropriated by

         Crusade for Freedom in New York, launched an experimental propaganda balloon project from
         Western Germany with Czechoslovakia as a target. This project was begun the week of August
         12, 1951. Balloons were subsequently <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0241"/>launched to
         Poland. Details of the project have since appeared in the press. The effectiveness of the

        <p>Working with the Economic Cooperation Administration the Psychological Operations

      <p>It was agreed that: <list>
        <label>(1)</label>
        <item>The proposed <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> Baltic broadcasts would not go on the
         air as scheduled and that a joint <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>–<gloss

        <label>(2)</label>
        <item>That the next Crusade for Freedom would not be of the high-pressure and spectacular
         nature of this year’s but would be something in the nature of a magazine and directmail
         approach with all copy carefully cleared.</item>
        <label>(3)</label>
        <item>That Radio Free Asia would undergo no further expansion until the future course of the
         Committee for Free Asia had been settled in a manner satisfactory to both <gloss

      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Discussion:</hi></p>
      <p>At the opening of the meeting an agenda was distributed in which was included brief
       statements proposing what the proper spheres of operation of <gloss target="#t_RFE1"
        >RFE</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> should be. These proposals were as
       follows:</p>
      <pb n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0245"/>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">1. Sphere of Activity for <gloss target="#t_RFE1"
         >RFE</gloss> and, by extension, <gloss target="#t_RFA1">RFA</gloss></hi></p>
      <p>To provide radio facilities so that the potentially most effective émigré groups can speak
       from nearby points to their captive fellow-countrymen. By implication this would preclude
       acknowledged sponsorship by American, British or any group other than the speaking émigrés.
       It also implies that the broadcasts would be in the standard broadcast band.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">2. Sphere of Activity for <gloss target="#t_VOA1"
         >VOA</gloss></hi></p>
      <p>To deliver a radio message, by both medium and short wave, in the name of the United States
       Government and the American people.</p>
      <p>These proposals were not agreed to in the meeting.</p>
      <p>Following the first reading of these proposals, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
        >Dulles</persName> pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> Czech program
       does not now credit émigré groups but rather puts forward effective individuals many of whom
       are anonymous.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFG1">Wisner</persName> advanced the suggestion that perhaps
        <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> activities should only be continued if they are
       supplementary and noncompetitive with <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> generalized this thought in a proposal
       that <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> should carry on covert or supplementary activities
       which will aid the official United States Government radio. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFG1"
        >Wisner</persName> did not think the term “Covert” could be logically applied in the case of
        <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JRP1">Joyce</persName> commented that at the present time the
       émigré committees connected with <gloss target="#t_NCFE1">NCFE</gloss> are so divided that
        <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> cannot ordinarily get authority to attribute items to
       any one of the émigré groups. He did add that the committees are serving one of their
       original purposes in that they are keeping émigré group pressure from officials in the State
       Department.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName>, in response to a question, said that
       there is now very little recording of program material by émigré groups in New York. That was
       previously the basic arrangement but now the bulk of the material is originating
       overseas.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEW1">Barrett</persName> referred to the four questions which
       were posed by Mr. <persName>Barnard</persName> at the previous meeting and said that we ought
       to examine all <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> activities in the light of the following
       questions: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>Is the activity one that is serving a useful enough purpose to justify the funds
         involved?</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>Can it be done better by this organization than by Government directly or by other
         existing organizations?</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>Is it jeopardizing the existence and success of other important activities?</item>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item>How can it best be financed?</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEW1">Barrett</persName> went on to say that according to best
       available estimates the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is now spending about two
       billion dollars a year on propaganda <pb n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0246"/>and directly
       related activities. Hence, there is considerable justification for multiple
       activities—provided they don’t adversely affect one another. He also said that some of the
       need for non-Governmental groups to participate in a “no holds barred” campaign has
       disappeared with the toughening attitude of the United States Government vis-à-vis <gloss
        target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, but that we should study carefully the extent to which such
       more-extreme-than-government activities are still justified.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BW1">Barbour</persName> stated that the limit on what the United
       States Government may say is probably getting less and less but there will always be some
       such area which can better be handled by a non-Governmental organization.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> stated that he does not see in practical
       terms what this non-Governmental area is. He mentioned that <gloss target="#t_VOA1"
        >VOA</gloss> is now using very strong anti-Stalin material and the principal yardstick is
       whether an item is effective propaganda or not. He pointed out that this same criterion would
       apply to the operations of a non-Governmental organization. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1"
        >Kohler</persName> added that he thinks that the <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>
       programming is probably a little more conservative than <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>
       because <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> is not so near policy and has to tread carefully
       on a number of issues. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BT1">Braden</persName> asked whether in the
       Far East, Radio Free Asia can say things that the United States Government cannot say. Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that he was not aware that it could. He
       added that if a third force group appeared which had something to say that we wanted said and
       could not say ourselves it would then be time to give them radio facilities.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BW1">Barbour</persName> stated that he feels that <gloss
        target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> could as a general rule take a more strident line than <gloss
        target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEW1">Barrett</persName> raised the question as to whether the
       Czech operation was actually ideal and suggested that we ought to get more information on
       it.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFG1">Wisner</persName> reported that the French are now taking
       active steps to form a national committee. He also said that the British were making some
       moves in that direction but had not gotten far. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEW1"
        >Barrett</persName> said that instead of a national committee for France, Britain, U.S., and
       so on, there ought to be a committee for Free Europe which would really be international in
       character. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> said that an international
       committee would be very difficult to organize and even more difficult to operate. What would
       be better in his opinion would be three national committees with a permanently sitting
       coordinating group, probably in Paris.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEW1">Barrett</persName> said that he felt we might somehow
       profit by the devices worked out by American political parties—organizations such as “New
       Dealers for Willkie”, “Young Democrats for Dewey” and so on.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> raised the question of what we are really
       after in Eastern Europe. He said that he didn’t think we needed propaganda in Eastern Europe
       because the Russians are doing our work for us.</p>
      <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0247"/>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JRP1">Joyce</persName> did not agree with this and referred to
       the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> basic documents in which we are directed to increase
       tension in Eastern Europe and try to release the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>’s hold
       over its satellites and roll back the Soviet borders to the 1939 line.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEW1">Barrett</persName> said that he felt it was most important
       for us to get news and ideas to the people in Eastern Europe. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1"
        >Kohler</persName> added that two radio voices—<gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> and
        <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>—are worse than one when they are not clearly
       distinguishable by the audience. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFG1">Wisner</persName> said if we
       needed more volume to Eastern Europe we should step up the Voice of America.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEW1">Barrett</persName> recalled the fact that Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> feels that there is nothing that needs to be said to the
       Baltic that cannot be said quite adequately by the Voice of America. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> raised the question of how the Baltic plans of <gloss
        target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> could be called off if it is decided not to put the programs on
       the air. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that in his talks with
        <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">John Hughes</persName><note n="3" xml:id="d94fn3"><persName
         corresp="#p_HJC2">Hughes</persName> was a prominent businessman, Ambassador to the Atlantic
        Council, and member of the <gloss target="#t_NCFE1">NCFE</gloss>.</note> and
        <persName>Adolph Berle</persName><note n="4" xml:id="d94fn4"><persName>Berle</persName> was
        a prominent lawyer, former Assistant Secretary of State, and a member of the <gloss
         target="#t_NCFE1">NCFE</gloss>.</note> he had the definite impression that the personnel
       which had so far been lined up for the Baltic program could be taken care of in other ways.
       He said it would be better to have a headache for a couple of weeks than to live the problem
       for a couple of years. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that a
       responsible group of American citizens had participated in the planning for this and other
        <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> activities and that they and their proposals could not
       just be casually dismissed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFG1">Wisner</persName> said he felt
       that a perfectly logical explanation could be advanced, that political conditions have
       changed and that the State Department is now able to carry on the Baltic job; therefore,
        <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>’s resources could be applied to other directions. Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_BEW1">Barrett</persName> recalled that the request from the State
       Department for the Baltic broadcast by <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> had come at a time
       when State did not have the financial resources to undertake such programs. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that the Baltic program need had first come to his
       attention in the winter of 1949–50. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>
       reminded the group that in May, 1951 the Department of State had approved <gloss
        target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> broadcasts in the Baltic languages. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_JRP1">Joyce</persName> said that this same approval had come as recently as
       August 8 of this year from the Department. It was generally agreed that in spite of these
       commitments conditions had changed and it was important now that <gloss target="#t_RFE1"
        >RFE</gloss> broadcasts did not go on in the Baltic languages. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> then said that he would get together in New York with
        <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> representatives to help them take the head off <gloss
        target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> in connection with any cancellation <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219"
        facs="0248"/>of the Baltic language broadcast plans. He said that he would do this within a
       week.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFG1">Wisner</persName> asked if the present policy of the
       Department would allow subversive broadcasts to this area. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1"
        >Kohler</persName> said there was no necessity for subversive broadcasts since we had not
       recognized the Soviet rule in these areas and were working with what we felt were the legal
       governments.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> said that close liaison between <gloss
        target="#t_IBD1">IBD</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> in New York was needed
       and he was told that arrangements had already been made for regular meetings between Mr.
        <persName>Kretzmann</persName><note n="5" xml:id="d94fn5"><persName>Roger
         Kretzmann</persName> of <gloss target="#t_IBD1">IBD</gloss>.</note> and Mr. [<hi
        rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] of <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> said that <gloss target="#t_RFE1"
        >RFE</gloss> has just about completed work on three stations in Lisbon which are powered
       with 50 kilowatts each. These have been intended for relaying purposes only, with the
       programs originating in Munich being sent to Portugal and then played back by short wave to
       Hungary, Romania, and so on. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEW1">Barrett</persName> made the
       suggestion that perhaps more radio operations could be justified simply on the basis of tying
       up Russian facilities and making some progress in the electronic war.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> raised the question of what should be
       done about the Crusade for Freedom next year. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEW1"
        >Barrett</persName> said that he felt that the present type of campaign was harming the
       total United States effort and making people ask the question whether the Voice of America is
       really needed. He did not say that to his surprise no serious questions came up in the last
       Congress concerning the apparent duplication between Radio Free Europe and <gloss
        target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEW1">Barrett</persName> suggested
       that instead of the present type of Crusade for Freedom, a low-pressure program should be
       conducted. He said that something along the line of the tuberculosis seal campaign in
       magazines, with coupons, and so on, ought to be tried out. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1"
        >Lloyd</persName> then said that <persName>Abbott Washburn</persName><note n="6"
        xml:id="d94fn6">Executive vice chairman of the Crusade for Freedom.</note> was only getting
       into high speed on the Crusade and that in the next few years he hoped to be able to work the
       Crusade for Freedom up to a point where 15 or 20 million dollars could be raised. Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> suggested that Mr.
        <persName>Washburn</persName> be brought down to Washington at an early date and given the
       idea of the low-pressure campaign. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEW1">Barrett</persName> raised
       the question of explaining the rest of the <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> budget if the
       mail order approach raises only about $750,000. He felt than an anonymous donor could take
       care of that problem but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> did not agree on
       this point. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> raised the question of whether
       the Crusade for Freedom has value in making the public more aware of the international <pb
        n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0249"/>political situation. It was said that this question
       could not really be answered. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEW1">Barrett</persName> felt that it
       probably made the public more aware in certain respects but on the whole created more
       problems than it solved.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEW1">Barrett</persName> raised the question about Radio Free
       Asia and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BT1">Braden</persName> replied that <gloss
        target="#t_RFA1">RFA</gloss> is staying right where it is until they are given further
       orders. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEW1">Barrett</persName> said that in regard to the radio
       audience in China it was his understanding that there is a small and decreasing audience as
       the result of Communist repressive measures. He felt that it was better for <gloss
        target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> to put its <gloss target="#t_RFA1">RFA</gloss> money into
       local, non-U.S.-labeled operations in the Far East. He said that we did not need another
       American voice in the area. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> then suggested
       that <gloss target="#t_RFA1">RFA</gloss> be kept going on its present basis along with CFA
       for the next few weeks until the new head of the organization is selected. He should then be
       brought in for a discussion of this whole problem. In closing, Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_BEW1">Barrett</persName> suggested that the four questions posed by Mr.
        <persName>Barnard</persName> be applied to all <gloss target="#t_NCFE1">NCFE</gloss> and CFA
       projects. He suggested that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> appoint one person and that
       State appoint another to work as a team to do this job. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
        >Dulles</persName> said that he would prefer to see a record of this meeting and have a
       chance to discuss it with his colleagues before appointing such a person.</p>

        counterespionage activities being conducted by the Services has never taken place and would
        be of great benefit and assistance in reducing duplication, eliminating the undue
        dissipation of intelligence assets, and providing an orderly controlled maximum utilization
        of the entire U.S. intelligence potential.</item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>It is recommended that the proposals in the attached agreement be concurred in and
        implemented and that the same proposals be extended to include the Navy and the Air

        <item>Establishment of “Agreed Activities” by the Department of the Army Under the
         Provisions of <gloss target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss> #5</item>
       </list>
       <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item><gloss target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss> #5 authorizes and directs that the <gloss
          target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> shall conduct all <hi rend="italic">organized</hi> Federal
         espionage operations outside the United States and its possessions for the collection of
         foreign intelligence information required to meet the needs of all Departments and Agencies
         concerned, in connection with the national security, <hi rend="italic">except for certain
          agreed activities by other Departments and Agencies</hi>. (The same policy applies to
         counter-espionage activities.) This directive further provides that the use of casual
         agents in a covert capacity by any <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> agency shall be
         coordinated by the <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> with the organized covert
         activities.</item>
        <pb n="222" xml:id="pg_222" facs="0251"/>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>For varying reasons, largely beyond the control of the intelligence agencies, the
         entire provisions of <gloss target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss> #5 have never been effectively
         implemented nor has the U.S. attained the position where it can now accomplish espionage
         operations on the scale required to meet completely the continually expanding needs of all
         the Departments and Agencies concerned. Since the original issuance of <gloss
          target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss> #5 in January 1947 there has been a steady expansion in
         the scope and volume of the intelligence information required by the military services and
         other agencies. Because this has been paralleled by an expansion in the security measures
         of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and its satellites, the U.S. Government has
         been faced with an ever increasing dependence upon espionage and related clandestine
         activities as the primary means for obtaining the information required.</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>Through necessity and with the tacit approval of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>,
         the Army intelligence elements within the overseas command areas have been conducting
         espionage operations, to varying degrees, since the end of World War II. Under a strictly
         legal interpretation of <gloss target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss> #5 in the absence of any
         official arrangements for “agreed activities” by the Department of the Army, the Army is
         not empowered to conduct organized espionage operations and <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
          >CIA</gloss> remains responsible for the conduct of espionage operations to meet both the
         tactical requirements of the overseas commanders and to meet the long range strategic
         requirements originating at the Washington level. However, the Army possesses, by virtue of
         its trained complements in overseas areas and its present and past “unagreed activities”,
         espionage assets which should be utilized to the fullest extent in order to meet the ever
         increasing need for that intelligence information which, under present conditions, is
         procureable only through clandestine operations. In order to regularize these necessary and
         desirable espionage activities being conducted by the Army, they should be “legalized” by
         agreement between the <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> and the Department of the Army as
         provided in <gloss target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss> #5. Such agreement would permit the
         Army, in large measure, to conduct espionage operations to meet those tactical information
         requirements which are in direct support of an overseas commander’s mission and would place
          <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> in a better position to concentrate on long range
         strategic requirements which usually necessitate deeper and more permanent
         operations.</item>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item>Various ad hoc arrangements have been made between the Army and <gloss
          target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> in an attempt to solve the problem of conducting espionage
         operations on a closely coordinated basis as envisaged by <gloss target="#t_NSCID1"
          >NSCID</gloss> #5. During the period 1949–50, <gloss target="#t_G21">G–2</gloss>, in
         collaboration with <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, prepared and issued to the
         intelligence chiefs of FECOM, <gloss target="#t_USFA1">USFA</gloss>, and <gloss
          target="#t_EUCOM1">EUCOM</gloss>, policy letters calling for joint planning and
         coordination of operations between <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and these overseas
         commands. However, these policies have not been implemented to a productive and
         satisfactory extent.</item>

         #5.</item>
        <label>6.</label>
        <item>It is deemed essential that action be taken to remedy these deficiencies with the
         least possible delay so that espionage operations being conducted by the Army shall be
         officially recognized by the <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> as “agreed activities”

        <label>7.</label>
        <item>The current situation may be sumarized as follows: <list>
          <label>a.</label>
          <item>The United States government is not now in a position to meet the full extent of its
           present needs for clandestine collection of intelligence information. Fulfillment of

           U.S. Government.</item>
          <label>b.</label>
          <item>Army intelligence elements within the overseas command areas are conducting
           espionage operations without their “accreditation” as “agreed activities” under the
           provisions of <gloss target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss> #5.</item>
          <label>c.</label>
          <item>The overseas commands have information requirements, based upon their assigned
           missions, which can only be met through espionage operations.</item>

          <label>e.</label>
          <item>As additional areas of the world become critical or sensitive, in terms of their
           involvement with the struggle between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the
           Western Powers, there will be a further increase in the scope and variety of information
           targets requiring espionage activity on the part of the U.S. Government.</item>
          <label>f.</label>
          <item>It has now become mandatory that <hi rend="italic">all</hi> U.S. espionage
           capabilities be put to use and that they be conducted in such a manner that each
           capability will be so applied as to best meet the overall interests of the U.S.
           Government.</item>
         </list></item>
        <label>8.</label>
        <item>It is believed that action should be taken to accomplish the following: <list>
          <label>a.</label>
          <item>Development of a basic agreement between the <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> and
           the Department of the Army that will establish the conditions, including type of
           espionage operations, and the extent to which Army intelligence elements within the
           overseas command areas may conduct, as “agreed activities” under the provisions of <gloss
            target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss> #5, espionage operations in direct support of the
           overseas commander’s mission or for such purposes as the <gloss target="#t_DCI1"
            >DCI</gloss> and the A.C. of S, <gloss target="#t_G21">G–2</gloss> may mutually agree to
           be in the overall interests of the U.S. Government.</item>
          <label>b.</label>
          <item>Development of specific agreements to meet the particular requirements and
           conditions existing within each overseas command area, with particular reference to the
           areas in or from which the Army intelligence elements may conduct espionage operations as
           “agreed activities.”</item>
          <label>c.</label>
          <item>Development of a mechanism for centralized coordination and control of U.S.
           espionage operations both at the Washington level and in the field, that will: <list>
            <label>(1)</label>
            <item>Promote the most effective use of all espionage capabilities currently or
             potentially available to the U.S. Government;</item>
            <label>(2)</label>
            <item>Avoid duplication of effort, unwitting multiple use of the same sources, false
             confirmation, and the dissipation of those intelligence asset which are
             available.</item>
           </list></item>
          <label>e.</label>
          <item>Preparation of the necessary directives to implement the action, outlined in
           sub-paragraphs a. through d. above, within the Army elements of the overseas commands and
           appropriate <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> stations overseas.</item>
         </list></item>
        <label>9.</label>
        <item>It is recommended that <gloss target="#t_G21">G–2</gloss> discuss this proposal

      </list>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_SVARLC1">Admiral Stevens</persName> opened the meeting by saying he
       was chairman of a small group in <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> charged with
       “formulating a national strategic concept for psychological action” as called for in the
       directive establishing the <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> and as envisioned in <gloss
        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 59/1 and <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2 which include
       both covert and overt propaganda activities.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> said he thought the covert and overt
       activities should be kept separate.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_SVARLC1">Admiral Stevens</persName> said that people were worried
       today because they felt that our foreign policy was “gone at piecemeal—on a hand to mouth
       basis” with no over-all strategic concept. A strategic concept, he said was a “point of
       view—a tentative plan of action, always under review but not rigid” and he thought that such
       a concept or plan should be put down on paper, difficult as it might be to do.</p>
      <p>A discussion ensued about the difficulties of getting “everything down” in <gloss
        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> papers and the danger of parts being lifted out of context to
       fit particular situations.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_SVARLC1">Admiral Stevens</persName> said that, at present, <gloss
        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> papers are the only approved guides to national policy and
       cited the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
        >U.S.S.R.</gloss> in which the policy of reducing the threat of Soviet power and <pb n="226"
        xml:id="pg_226" facs="0255"/>influence is set forth. How far, he asked, do you have to
       reduce the power and influence to have meaning. The fomenting of revolution within the <gloss
        target="#t_USSR1">U.S.S.R.</gloss> is to be treated separately because the U.S. is not
       prepared for such an undertaking and would have no assurance of success, but in order to form
       an over-all concept it has to be considered.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_SVARLC1">Admiral Stevens</persName> referred to the <gloss
        target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> paper dated 15 November, entitled <hi rend="italic">National
        Psychological Strategy</hi>,<note n="2" xml:id="d96fn2">A copy is in National Archives, RG
        59, Central Files 1950–54, 100.4–<gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss>/5–1551.</note> which
       had been sent to the Department informally the previous week. He said it was only a working
       draft intended to evince reactions from State and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. What
       he’d like, would be to have <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName>, <persName
        corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_JRP1">Joyce</persName> and
        <persName corresp="#p_WFG1">Wisner</persName> get together and see if they couldn’t come up
       with a “central strategic concept.”</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> suggested that perhaps it would be better
       to start at the narrowest part of the problem, i.e. how to reduce the threat of Soviet power
       and influence.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_SVARLC1">Admiral Stevens</persName> said that the <gloss
        target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> draft was an attempt to outline the steps necessary to create a
       central strategic concept and that <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/5<note n="3"
        xml:id="d96fn3"><ref target="#d90">Document 90</ref>.</note> was a “holding operation” which
       he defined as “placing the maximum strain on the Soviet structure of power.”</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> pointed out that “maximum strain” were
       meaningless words—that we should get down to the concrete.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_SVARLC1">Admiral Stevens</persName> returned to the <gloss
        target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> draft and said that what State had been asked for was (a) its
       point of view about creating revolutions in the satellites, (b) what political actions would
       be undertaken for the holding operation set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
       10/5, and (c) what could be accomplished by other actions including propaganda controlled by
       State.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> again urged that we take a concrete
       problem such as the retraction and reduction of Soviet power and influence. This is <hi
        rend="italic">one</hi> policy objective of the U.S. Government but <hi rend="italic"
        >not</hi> the sum total of U.S. policy—there are a whole hierarchy of objectives. It would
       be fine if Soviet power would retract but as you get down to accomplishing this you get into
       many complex problems. Stimulating a revolution in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
        >U.S.S.R.</gloss> is not now a current practical objective.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_SVARLC1">Admiral Stevens</persName> said a statement to this effect
       should be put out and approved by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>. <gloss
        target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> needs this kind of a statement as part of a central
       concept.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> said there is no single policy but a
       multiplicity of policies like the multiplicity of dots which make the whole image on a
       radarscope. He said he wasn’t clear how a central concept would be helpful—we should look at
       specific areas—Albania, for example. There <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0256"/>are many
       serious complications which flow from creating a revolution in any satellite country.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> said he felt that we should develop our
       capabilities in the covert field as far as possible. We should move up in successive first
       approximations on an area by area, technique by technique basis.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_SVARLC1">Admiral Stevens</persName> agreed with the area by area
       approach and said that <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> must then come in with what it is
       capable of doing. He said he realized that a central concept wouldn’t solve all our problems
       but that we ought to try to put one down on paper.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> suggested that it might be possible to
       take specific areas such as East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, etc., and assuming that we
       had certain covert action capabilities, take a look at what the political implications of
       such actions would be. At the same time we might select certain areas and assuming the
       existence of favorable political factors have <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> determine
       what their covert capabilities were. Then the two determinations might be married.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> said he worried about theoretical
       situations. Where there existed a clear problem with concrete possibilities of accomplishing
       something, this approach might be OK, but taking a series of hypothetical situations and
       trying to see through all the branching implications and reactions would be a negative
       exercise.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_SVARLC1">Admiral Stevens</persName> said that some of the fringe
       areas around the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">U.S.S.R.</gloss> are vulnerable and we should look
       carefully to see what can be done. He said <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> was capable of
       carrying out several simultaneous operations if it seemed desirable to do so.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_WFG1"
        >Wisner</persName> needs to know the general direction in which we want to proceed so that
       he can <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1">lay</persName> out his plans and have his agents
       prepared. Therefore, we should take a look at individual areas.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_SVARLC1">Admiral Stevens</persName> said it still gets back to a
       central strategic concept. Put down on paper that we don’t want to create a revolution in the
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">U.S.S.R.</gloss> as well as some of the “lesser things” we do want
       to do. It will just be an approximation to be used as guidelines for <gloss target="#t_PSB1"
        >PSB</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> again emphasized the difficulty of setting
       forth general principles until you get down to specific problems. There is always the danger
       that people will think that by having broad principles lots of specific problems will be
       solved.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_SVARLC1">Admiral Stevens</persName> said he still thought that we’d
       make the biggest advance if State would undertake to respond to the request in the <gloss
        target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> paper.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> said he thought that joint work with
        <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> was called for
       so that everyone would be clear on the dimensions of the <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228"
        facs="0257"/>problem and just what was to be accomplished. He suggested that we address
       ourselves to the specific question of the retraction and reduction of Soviet power and
       influence. He said he could envisage a paper broken down somewhat as follows: <list>
        <label>a.</label>
        <item>Reduction and retraction of Soviet power to acceptable proportions over a 10-year
         period.</item>
        <label>b.</label>
        <item>Any thought of revolution in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">U.S.S.R.</gloss> must come
         at the end of the 10-year period.</item>
        <label>c.</label>
        <item>Reduction of Soviet power in the Satellites in the near term.</item>
        <label>d.</label>
        <item>The development of techniques to accomplish a, b, and c.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>This is a first approximation and should be kept under continuing review.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_SVARLC1">Admiral Stevens</persName> said he would like to have a
       “good” State Department man sit with his committee to coordinate the responses to the <gloss
        target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> paper.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> replied that taking responses and putting
       them together wouldn’t work—what was needed was joint work by State, <gloss target="#t_OPC1"
        >OPC</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss>.</p>
      <p>There followed an inconclusive discussion of the term “psychological strategy”, during
       which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> pointed out the dangers involved in
       trying to marry propaganda and covert operations. They should be kept separate and made
       concrete and definable.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_SVARLC1">Admiral Stevens</persName> returned to the <gloss
        target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> paper and asked if State could put anything on paper which
       would be helpful—could it, for instance, redraft the three requests made of it?</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> said he considered the framework of the
       paper wrong. It appeared that the retraction and reduction of Soviet power and influence was
       the “be all” and “end all” of our policy. If this phase of our policy could be taken as a
       specific problem and so addressed, he thought we could come up with something useful. He
       ended the meeting by saying that we would get together with someone from <gloss
        target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> and try to map out a
       course of action.</p>

       <label>1.</label>
       <item>In view of the duties and responsibilities imposed upon the Director of Central
        Intelligence and the Central Intelligence Agency by Section 102(d) of the National Security
        Act of 1947, as amended, the <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> herewith advises the
        National Security Council that he is gravely concerned as to the security and effectiveness
        with which the Communications Intelligence activities of the Government are being
        conducted.</item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>It is believed that existing means of control over, and coordination of, the collection
        and processing of Communications Intelligence have proved ineffective to assess and
        reconcile the Communications Intelligence requirements of the various interested Departments
        and Agencies and, as well, the national intelligence requirements in this field.</item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>It is further believed that the system of divided authorities and multiple
        responsibilities which prevails with respect to Communications Intelligence will, if
        uncorrected, preclude the development of the consistent, firmly administered security
        program which is required in order to preserve this invaluable intelligence source. In
        recent years a number of losses have occurred which it is difficult to attribute to
        coincidence.</item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item>Because of the unique value of Communications Intelligence, this matter directly
        affects the national security. Any corrective measures to be taken should be based upon a

        Security Establishment and those of the various Departments and Agencies concerned.</item>
       <label>5.</label>
       <item>Accordingly, it is recommended that the Secretary of State and the Secretary of

      <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. Secretary:</p>
      <p>In anticipation of the probability of a military cease-fire in Korea, as well as the
       possibility of a breakdown in negotiations, it becomes important to review our assets in
       China proper and the effect thereon of either development. A year ago the Chinese Nationalist
       Government claimed the existence of 1,500,000 guerrillas on the Mainland of China, and
       although we believe that this figure was exaggerated, we know that during the past year the
       effective action of the Chinese Communist forces has greatly reduced the number of
       guerrillas. The current <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> estimate is approximately
       165,000. A military cease-fire on the Korean peninsula will probably restore freedom of
       movement to a major portion of Chinese forces now confronting us, and it is to be assumed
       that the Chinese Communist Government will then take action to intensify the anti-guerrilla
       campaign.</p>
      <p>Another asset is the Chinese Nationalist Forces on Taiwan. Their army now consists of about
       450,000 ground troops in fair state of small unit training but with inadequate equipment and
       in a poor state of combat effectiveness. Their small Navy and Air Force have both
       deteriorated militarily as a result of lack of equipment and training facilities. These
       forces will within four years begin to undergo a rapid deterioration through age alone. They,
       like the guerrillas on the Mainland, represent a waning asset which will have to be
       strengthened, built up, and used within the immediate foreseeable future if we are to get any
       benefit from them.</p>
      <p>The military and economic programs for the support of Taiwan, such as they are, have
       attained only limited success. This is due in part at least to Nationalist refusal to effect
       political reform and particularly to the failure of the Nationalist Government to eliminate
       corruption among its officials. Our support to guerrillas has so far failed to produce the
       results which had been initially anticipated, due primarily to Nationalist reluctance to
       commit their guerrilla assets to action and secondarily to the difficulty of Chinese
       Nationalist regular officers of senior grade to adapt themselves to the conditions and
       requirements of guerrilla warfare.</p>
      <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0260"/>
      <p>Recent studies based on personal observation on the spot by several qualified officers
       serving with this Agency indicate the following: <list>
        <label>(a)</label>
        <item>The Chinese Nationalist forces are not as ineffective potentially as the pessimistic
         reports made a year ago, by our Service Attachés then on Taiwan, would indicate. Neither
         are they as effective as the optimistic reports of Americans now employed directly or
         indirectly by the Chinese Nationalist Government would indicate. My belief is that they can
         be made effective and that if U.N. policy permitted, and if the Nationalist Government
         would cooperate effectively, Chinese Nationalist divisions could be rotated to Korea and
         might serve very creditably. It is the opinion of General <persName>Wyman</persName><note
          n="2" xml:id="d98fn2">Major General <persName>Willard G. Wyman</persName>, a so-called
          China hand, serving as Commander of US Forces, Southeastern Europe at this time.</note>
         and other qualified observers that the presence of a Nationalist division in Korea in
         contact with former Nationalist troops now serving the Communist Government would have a
         marked psychological effect.</item>
        <label>(b)</label>
        <item>The existing scattered and relatively ineffective guerrilla forces on the Mainland, if
         well led, armed, and given a political rallying point, could be made a potent weapon and
         might contain much stronger Chinese Communist forces.</item>
        <label>(c)</label>
        <item>The presence on Taiwan of a Chinese Nationalist force gaining in strength as the
         result of training, improved morale, and improved equipment, would, particularly if its
         combat training should include repeated and aggressive raids and temporary thrusts onto the
         Mainland, immobilize for coastal defense a considerable portion of the better troops of the
         Chinese Communist Army and a large quantity of its military transport. The Nationalist
         troops on certain offshore islands are doing this at the present time on a small scale and
         the threat could be intensified.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>In my opinion if we are to obtain the full effect of the possibilities enumerated above,
       two things are required. The first is a change in our own policy with respect to employment
       of Chinese Nationalist forces and a more aggressive approach to the use of guerrillas.
       Second: political reform of the Chinese Nationalist Government is essential. So far U.S.
       efforts to encourage such reform have been almost without success as the controlling clique
       of the KMT has been unwilling to loosen its stranglehold on the Government. It is probable
       that this intransigeance stems from the belief that maintenance of the status quo gives this
       clique an exclusive claim to reinheritance of the Mainland as a by-product of U.S. victory in
       World War III.</p>
      <p>Attached are two studies<note n="3" xml:id="d98fn3">Not printed.</note> bearing on the
       basic subject which I suggest be given military staff consideration. One of these represents
       the <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0261"/>views of the Estimates Division of this
        Agency<note n="4" xml:id="d98fn4">Estimates Division is the Office of National
        Estimates.</note> which, although not an <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> coordinated
       paper, reflects the most recent estimates of the military intelligence agencies. As will be
       noted, this paper does not concern itself with the beneficial effects which would result from
       an improvement of the political situation on Taiwan. The other study which represents the
       views of the operating divisions of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> points up the
       difficulties resulting from the present unsatisfactory political situation and concentrates
       upon the importance of a housecleaning in Taiwan and a clarification of U.S. policy if
       significant results are to be achieved.</p>
      <p>These are my personal views, based on conversations with all those in this Agency who are
       giving consideration to the exploitation of our assets in the Far East. I recommend, however,
       that the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider this general subject and the attached papers as a
       matter of urgency for the purpose of amplifying and firming up our present program and, if
       indicated by mature consideration, producing recommendations which will crystallize our
       governmental policy toward the strengthening of Taiwan as an anti-Communist base militarily,
       economically, politically, and psychologically. It seems to me that the self-interest of the
       United States demands this.</p>
      <p>Personnel of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> are prepared to participate and assist in
       this study and in the planning which should follow. For this purpose I have arranged to
       secure the services of General <persName>Frank Merrill</persName><note n="5" xml:id="d98fn5"
        >Major General <persName>Merrill</persName> (Ret.) was a veteran of both the China and Burma

       East and he would head the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> contribution to any planning

      <head>99. Editorial Note</head>
      <p>On December 13, 1951, President <persName corresp="#p_THS1">Truman</persName> directed the
       Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense, assisted by the Director of Central
       Intelligence, to appoint a committee to examine United States Government Communications
       Intelligence (<gloss target="#t_COMINT1">COMINT</gloss>) efforts and to recommend measures to
       improve their conduct and security. (<persName corresp="#p_THS1">Truman</persName> Library,
       President’s Secretary’s File) The committee was headed by prominent New York attorney
        <persName corresp="#p_BG1">George A. Brownell</persName> and included <persName
        corresp="#p_BCE1">Charles E. Bohlen</persName>, representing the Department of State,
        <persName corresp="#p_MBGJUSA1">General John Magruder</persName>, representing the
       Department of Defense, and <persName corresp="#p_JWH1">William H. Jackson</persName>,
       representing the Central Intelligence Agency. The committee submitted a five-part report on
       June 13, 1952. Part I was a history of U.S. <gloss target="#t_COMINT1">COMINT</gloss>
       efforts, Part II dealt with the role of <gloss target="#t_COMINT1">COMINT</gloss>, Part III
       laid out the then-current organization of the <gloss target="#t_COMINT1">COMINT</gloss>
       community, Part IV detailed the actual conduct of <gloss target="#t_COMINT1">COMINT</gloss>
       activities, and Part V consisted of the report’s conclusions and recommendations.</p>
      <p>The major findings of the report were that the four existing <gloss target="#t_COMINT1"
        >COMINT</gloss> organizations (Army, Navy, Air Force, and Armed Forces Security Agency
        (<gloss target="#t_AFSA1">AFSA</gloss>), which was controlled by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
        >JCS</gloss>) were conducting duplicative operations in many areas and that the U.S.
       Communications Intelligence Board (<gloss target="#t_USCIB1">USCIB</gloss>) lacked adequate
       authority to correct the situation. The report recommended that <gloss target="#t_AFSA1"
        >AFSA</gloss> be given greatly expanded authority over the service organizations, that the
        <gloss target="#t_AFSA1">AFSA</gloss> director report directly to the Secretary of Defense,
       and that <gloss target="#t_USCIB1">USCIB</gloss> be replaced by a new, strengthened <gloss
        target="#t_COMINT1">COMINT</gloss> Board chaired by the <gloss target="#t_DCI1"
       >DCI</gloss>.</p>
      <p>In October 1952, the President and the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> adopted most of
       the <persName corresp="#p_BG1">Brownell</persName> Committee’s recommendations and issued a
       revised version of <gloss target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss> No. 9 on October 24, 1952 (<ref
        target="#d257">Document 257</ref>). In place of <gloss target="#t_AFSA1">AFSA</gloss>, the
       National Security Agency was created. <gloss target="#t_NSA1">NSA</gloss> had the same
       resources as <gloss target="#t_AFSA1">AFSA</gloss>, but a different charter. The <gloss
        target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> was removed from the chain of command. The Secretary of Defense
       was made executive agent for the government as a whole for <gloss target="#t_COMINT1"
        >COMINT</gloss>, subordinate to a special committee of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"

       continue. He said that the major question was what sort of Crusade could be organized and
       still not present serious problems for the Department of State. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_JCD1">Jackson</persName> said that the most troublesome aspect of the 1951
       Crusade was its length of three months. He said that a shorter Crusade pitched at a lower
       level would solve many of the problems that had occurred in the past year. He said that one
       good idea that had been developed by local committees was to have a one-day civic
       organization doorbell ringing campaign. Some buildup of publicity would be necessary for a
       national doorbell ringing campaign but it would be nothing to compare with the extended
       Crusade of this year. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JCD1">Jackson</persName> said that the direct
       mail approach had been tried this year with some success and could be expanded. He added that
       he felt the short campaign would have the additional advantage of removing the possibility of
       the public’s making invidious comparisons between <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> and
        <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>. He said that with the <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235"
        facs="0264"/>short campaign there would not be time for the public to reflect on such
       issues.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEW1">Barrett</persName> reminded the group that <gloss
        target="#t_NCFE1">NCFE</gloss> had started as an organization to look after and make use of
       the various Eastern European refugee groups. He recalled that giving these groups a radio
       voice was something of a later development. He also recalled that the Crusade was established
       primarily as a cover for the governmental support of the enterprise. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_BEW1">Barrett</persName> raised the question of whether or not the Crusade had
       grown to such proportions that it was now a case of the tail wagging the dog. He also raised
       the question of whether the two or three million dollars that might be raised in the Crusade
       might be endangering the $85,000,000 involved in the appropriations for the <gloss
        target="#t_USIE1">USIE</gloss> operations. He thought it was important to get back to the
       idea of just enough of a Crusade to give the minimum necessary cover to <gloss
        target="#t_NCFE1">NCFE</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEW1">Barrett</persName> suggested
       direct mail solicitation of funds, magazine advertisements and coupons, and corporation
       solicitations. He also said that he thought the device of large anonymous gifts might be
       looked into further.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JCD1">Jackson</persName> said that after the 1951 campaign it
       became clear to him that the Crusade had actually done an important selling job on the
       American public in the matter of psychological warfare and the importance of such an effort
       to our nation. He felt that this was a most important aspect of the Crusade and one that had
       been usually overlooked. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JCD1">Jackson</persName> said also that an
       efficient field organization had been built up for the Crusade and it was one which could
       respond to almost any kind of stimuli we wanted to apply.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> suggested that the Crusade’s national
       organization might be used to communicate to the public other messages which would be useful
       in connection with the United States’ psychological warfare effort.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">Sargeant</persName> said that if the Crusade’s national
       organization were really going to continue to be a force in the situation, it would be
       necessary to keep it busy the year around with useful projects such as film shows,
       publicizing the visits of foreign labor leaders, and participating in other activities
       relating to the international propaganda situation.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEW1">Barrett</persName> said that it was important to secure
       international sponsorship for the <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> broadcasts as had been
       done for the balloon operations.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JCD1">Jackson</persName> said that the international nature of
       the balloon message did not add anything to its effectiveness. He said that current attempts
       to set up committees in France and England along the lines of <gloss target="#t_NCFE1"
        >NCFE</gloss> were not succeeding and he doubted seriously whether that was a fruitful line
       of further endeavor. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JCD1">Jackson</persName> said that he felt the
       development should be toward the Munich-type of operation to Czechoslovakia where <pb n="236"
        xml:id="pg_236" facs="0265"/>the program has acquired such a predominantly local coloration
       that the American connection is almost completely submerged. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
        >Dulles</persName> agreed that an international committee was not a workable
       arrangement.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName>Washburn</persName> said that two million dollars gross had been raised in
       the Crusade this year when there was a stated goal. He thought that the next Crusade need not
       have a specific goal and that such a change would help keep things in a low key.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> commented that in the 1951 Crusade, the
       impression was given that the combined efforts of <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> and
        <gloss target="#t_RFA1">RFA</gloss> were covering the world as far as radio propaganda needs
       were concerned.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">Sargeant</persName> said that he felt a Crusade national
       organization could serve a useful purpose in developing popular interest in psychological
       warfare and could at the same time assign tasks to local groups which would actually assist
       in the psychological warfare effort. He mentioned writing of letters and essay contests.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> said that he hoped that the group could
       agree on the Crusade’s going ahead this year on a program that will be worked out in close
       coordination with <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JCD1">Jackson</persName> said that he hoped a four point decision
       could be reached: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>That the Crusade should go ahead this year.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>That it should take place in September at the earliest and not last more than two
         weeks.</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>That the Crusade national organization should proceed in the meantime with the jobs of
         general education on psychological warfare matters, and an explanation of <gloss

        <label>4.</label>
        <item>That <gloss target="#t_NCFE1">NCFE</gloss> should collaborate with the Department of
         State on what should be said to local groups.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JCD1">Jackson</persName>’s suggestions were discussed but there
       was no general agreement.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEW1">Barrett</persName> felt that agreement at this time should
       be limited to saying that the Crusade organization should not be disbanded, that there should
       be a Crusade in 1952 of a considerably lower pitched nature, and that the precise character
       of the 1952 Crusade should be worked out in close consultation between <gloss
        target="#t_NCFE1">NCFE</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and State. This was
       agreed to by all present.</p>

       <item>Civil Air Transport (<gloss target="#t_CAT1">CAT</gloss>, Incorporated) is a Chinese
        flag airline wholly owned by the United States Government and controlled by this Agency. As
        a commercial airline, Civil Air Transport performs a wide variety of covert services for the
        Agency throughout the Far East [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not declassified</hi>]. It is the
        single most valuable asset of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> in the Far East,
        without which the Agency would find it impossible either to discharge its operational tasks
        or to plan the greatly increased activities envisaged under <gloss target="#t_NSC1"

       <item>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (15 lines) not declassified</hi>]</item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item>Apart from the U.S. Government’s interest outlined above, there appears to be ample
        justification for approving Civil Air Transport’s application on strictly commercial
        grounds. Firstly, whereas under the terms of the Sino-U.S. bilateral agreement a United
        States carrier is permitted to serve Formosa, the Chinese Government’s designated
        instrument, Civil Air Transport, by virtue of its aircraft limitations, has been unable to
        avail itself of rights to serve points in the U.S. territories specified in the route annex
        of the agreement. Notwithstanding the precise terms of the agreement, it would seem in
        order, as a matter of <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0267"/>comity, to grant the
        designated airline of China traffic rights to serve an alternate point under United States
        control which is within the airline’s capabilities to serve. Secondly, the routes flown by
        Civil Air Transport naturally include Okinawa and it is hardly justifiable that Okinawa, a
        point in the immediate trading area of Formosa, should be denied the service of the
        international airline of China. Thirdly, Civil Air Transport is the only airline in the area
        which has the capacity and the willingness to render low cost cargo and passenger service
        commensurate with the economy of the area; this factor is expected to attract substantial
        traffic of U.S. contractors and others on Okinawa employing indigenous personnel. It is not
        calculated, however, that any appreciable inroad will be made on the business of other
        competitive airlines inasmuch as the type of traffic which could be carried by Civil Air
        Transport would not, in any event, be moved by other commercial air carriers. Lastly, it
        would constitute an economic hardship to the airline in serving its routes from Korea to
        Thailand to have no traffic rights at Okinawa inasmuch as it would still be necessary to
        make technical stops at Okinawa for the purpose of fueling.</item>
       <label>5.</label>
       <item>With reference to the final paragraph of reference a. it should be noted that the Civil
        Aeronautics Board does not have jurisdiction over civil air operations at Okinawa except
        where carriers of the United States are involved. This Agency does not desire that the
        United States Government’s interests in Civil Air Transport be disclosed to the Board at
        this time; conversely, it is believed that coordination with the Board, without disclosure
        of United States Government interest might lead to unnecessary delays and possible
        obstructions by representations of interested United States carriers. It is requested,
        therefore, that the matter not be coordinated with Civil Aeronautics Board as suggested. The
        subject has, however, been discussed with Mr. <persName>Alexis Johnson</persName>, Deputy
        Assistant Secretary for Far Eastern Affairs, Department of State, who has stated that the
        Department will interpose no objection to approval of Civil Air Transport’s
        application.</item>
       <label>6.</label>
       <item>The Agency considers it a matter of great importance and urgency that the subject
        application be approved. Failure to obtain such approval will result in the most serious
        setbacks to the Agency’s operations.</item>

        and explore the requirement for a pre-D-Day reconnaissance of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
         >USSR</gloss>. Air Force representatives included officers from Requirements, Plans,
        Operations, Intelligence, Development and the AF State Department representative. Brig. Gen.
         <persName>Garland</persName> was the senior officer present.</item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>In opening the discussions, the Chairman stated that it was necessary to develop a firm
        requirement in order to sell State Department in the need for relaxing the diplomatic side
        enough to permit violations of sovereignty. It will be necessary to impress on State the
        degree to which our offensive will rely on pre-D-Day reconnaissance in order to carry out
        our post-D-Day strikes. Secondly, Air Force must point out the large vacuum existing in
        intelligence regarding the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The Chairman stated that
         <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> had been asked to participate in developing a
        requirement. <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>, however, declined, stating that in their
        view the requirement should be based on the need for intelligence. <gloss target="#t_SAC1"
         >SAC</gloss> did not want to raise the implication that their offensive would be delayed by
        waiting for reconnaissance!!!</item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>The representative from Development outlined what was on hand or would be available in
        the future. He stated that it was necessary to obtain guidance on which item or items to
        push. In other words, where will they put their money? He discussed balloons, drones, a
        recon version of the Snark<note n="3" xml:id="d102fn3">Snark was a proposed Air Force
         strategic cruise missile.</note> and piloted aircraft. The recon Snark should be available
        in 1954 and will have speed of Mach .95 and altitude of 52,000. Drones can now be controlled
        up to 50 miles and this can probably be raised to 200 miles. Gopher balloons will be
        available in the fall of 1952.</item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item>Requirements representative stated that recon was needed on (1) new industrial
        complexes and air facilities for which there is no <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0269"
        />intelligence or for which we need new intelligence, (2) area from Urals to <gloss
         target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> on which there is no photo coverage and (3) general recon to
        uncover new targets developed since WW II. It was also pointed out that warning requirement
        was also of prime importance.</item>
       <label>5.</label>
       <item>Air Force State representative reported that State had formerly taken a dim view of
        violations such as photo recon would involve. However, he believed that now that
        international affairs had gotten to present condition, State might not take as serious
        objections as before. They might agree that the planes, etc., might get shot down the
        indicent would not start a war. [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] He stated balloons might cause
        misgivings in State because of their lack of directional control and possible aimless
        wanderings. Representative seemed to think State might go along with Snark, drones, etc., if
        requirement strongly presented.</item>
       <label>6.</label>
       <item><gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> representative was asked how <gloss
         target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> might contribute. It was pointed out that only a very limited
        capability existed at present. A <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> capability might be
        developed but will require a large amount of support from Air Force. At best, and for some
        time in the future, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> capability will be largely
        peripheral.</item>
       <label>7.</label>
       <item>It was decided that Intelligence Section of USAF would develop the draft requirement
        from the intelligence viewpoint. Other sections would assist as required. Presumably, <gloss
         target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> will be specifically asked for any future information if Air
        Force so desires.</item>

        as between State, Defense, <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
         >CIA</gloss>, as a preliminary to a possible <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> staff

       <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> began for State by giving a brief
        résumé of our present policy with respect to Formosa and the Chinese Nationalists, which is
        largely spelled out in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 48/5.<note n="4" xml:id="d106fn4"
         >For <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 48/5, see <ref target="frus1951v06p1#pg_33"><hi

          target="frus1951v06p1#pg_63">63</ref>.</note> Following this, Mr. <persName
         corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> said that he would like to take up the points in the
         <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> paper of 22 March 1952, one by one, in order to clarify
        certain doubts which the State Department had as to the significance and underlying meaning
        of these points. It was not clear to the Department whether the paper refers to what the
        policy should be on the assumption of a truce in Korea, or whether it proposed modifications
        of the existing policy either at the present time or on the basis of some other assumption.
        He asked whether subparagraph (c) meant that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> were
        proposing the lifting of restrictions now in order to allow the Chinese Nationalists to
        attack the mainland.</item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item><persName corresp="#p_FAWM1">Admiral Fechteler</persName> replied that the meaning of
        this paragraph is that we should not close the door to movements westward from Formosa. It
        did not mean that the ban against westward movements should be lifted immediately, but only
        if conditions should warrant this in the light of developing circumstances.</item>
       <label>5.</label>
       <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> replied that this was a very helpful
        clarification and one quite satisfactory to State. The Department had been concerned <pb
         n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0276"/>lest this mean a recommendation for an overt policy
        change at the present time—since such a policy change would be interpreted world-wide as a
        full engagement of U.S. power and prestige in the destruction of the Chinese Communist
        regime on the mainland.</item>
       <label>6.</label>
       <item><persName corresp="#p_FAWM1">Admiral Fechteler</persName> asked what the situation
        would be if the Chinese Nationalists should attempt to launch raids against the mainland
        from Formosa now. What would we do; would we try to stop this; and if so, by what means
        would we seek to stop it—by diplomatic or by military means? Messrs.
         <persName>Allison</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> replied that
        they regarded this as an academic question at the present time, since the Nationalists are
        not in a position to launch significant landings against the mainland without our
        help.</item>
       <label>7.</label>
       <item><persName corresp="#p_BGON1">General Bradley</persName> asked Mr. <persName
         corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> whether <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> operations
        have suffered or are suffering from the existing policy, which prohibits movements east or
        west, and if so, what changes we consider necessary in order to remove the
        interferences.</item>
       <label>8.</label>
       <item>[<hi rend="italic">11 lines not declassified</hi>] (At a later point in the discussion,
        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> raised the question as to whether the
        present policy means that the Nationalists are prevented from reinforcing the offshore
        islands from Formosa. It was the unanimous response that the present policy does not
        prohibit the reinforcement or re-supply of the offshore islands from Formosa, since the
        policy is restrictive only against attacks upon the China mainland. It was further stated
        that what happens as between the offshore islands and the mainland is not affected by the
        present policy and that it need not be a concern of this Government.)</item>
       <label>9.</label>
       <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> stated with respect to subparagraph
        (c) that State could accept the explanation and interpretation given by <persName
         corresp="#p_FAWM1">Admiral Fechteler</persName> provided its meaning were clearly spelled
        out as requiring a re-examination of all of the circumstances which might be applicable at
        the appropriate moment in connection with a determination of whether the circumstances might
        warrant a lifting of the ban on movement westward.</item>
       <label>10.</label>
       <item><persName corresp="#p_HGRJE1">General Hull</persName> stated that he considered the
        question somewhat more fundamental and not so easy to dismiss. The existence of the westward
        ban implies that we have a substantially negative policy on the use of present and potential
        resources on Formosa. The question is, “Do we build up or don’t we?” If there is to be a
        build-up, there must be at the very least a philosophy understood and accepted at the top
        levels of this Government that we are building toward a positive or affirmative exploitation
        of the Formosa potential. Lacking this philosophy, Formosa will simply fail to receive the
        priorities and hence won’t get the stuff. The other competitive demands for our military aid
        will eat up all of the matériel, and Formosa will get nothing.</item>

       <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> thought the present language of <gloss
         target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 48/5 is both broad enough and sufficiently flexible to permit
        a build-up not only <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248" facs="0277"/>for defensive purposes but also
        for possible offensive purposes. He quoted portions of the language of this paper in support
        of his point.</item>
       <label>12.</label>
       <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> said he was inclined to agree with
         <persName corresp="#p_HGRJE1">General Hull</persName>’s position that the language could be
        amended slightly to give it a more positive ring, provided that it was clearly understood
        that we would not tell the Chinese Nationalists that we were changing the policy and
        undertaking the support of a build-up for offensive purposes. He explained that the Chinese
        Nationalists would surely exploit any such statement or information on a world-wide basis
        with grave embarrassment to our over-all position and at a time when it is still difficult
        to foresee what future developments will bring.</item>
       <label>13.</label>
       <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> said that he was troubled about the
        fact that this is the only spot in the world where we are using our own forces to protect
        the Communists. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> replied that this was
        perhaps theoretically so, but he said that we would no doubt move to restrain any others
        over whom we have influence if we thought they were likely to launch overt aggressive
        attacks against the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or the satellites. He said,
        moreover, the “protection of the Communists” is at this time illusory since there is nothing
        at the moment to protect the Chinese Communists <hi rend="italic">from</hi>.</item>
       <label>14.</label>
       <item><persName corresp="#p_HGRJE1">General Hull</persName> in reply to a question from Mr.
         <persName>Allison</persName> stated that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> did not
        deem it within the realm of possibility to build up the Chinese Nationalists to the point
        where they could successfully undertake an invasion of the Chinese mainland without
        extensive military assistance from us. He said, “If they go back, we have got to put them
        back.”</item>
       <label>15.</label>
       <item>Reverting to an earlier point in the conversation, Mr. <persName>Allison</persName>
        said that it might clarify the situation somewhat if we would state now that if there should
        be an overt Communist attack against Southeast Asia, we would employ the Chinese Nationalist
        potential against Hainan or such other places as might be most effectively attacked by these
        forces.</item>
       <label>16.</label>
       <item><persName corresp="#p_HGRJE1">General Hull</persName> said this would be helpful.
         <persName corresp="#p_BGON1">General Bradley</persName> said that this last point tended to
        confuse him somewhat. He was trying to sort out in his mind the difference between the paper
        now under consideration and discussions of another paper relating to what actions we would
        take in the event of an attack by the Chinese Communists against Southeast Asia. He reminded
        the meeting that the present discussion grew out of and had been touched off by <persName
         corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>’s letter, which had taken the line that if we
        are going to do anything about Formosa, time is of the essence.</item>
       <label>17.</label>
       <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> stated that this was as he understood
        it to be. <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>’s letter had clearly pointed
        up the aspect of wasting assets and the disintegration of the situation on Formosa from both
        a military and political standpoint. There are disquieting reports about the political and
        military situation on Formosa—reports of sagging morale and other things which open up
        alarming possibilities as to what may <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0278"/>happen if we
        do not firm up our policy for that area and take appropriate action under the new
        policy.</item>
       <label>18.</label>
       <item><p><persName corresp="#p_BGON1">General Bradley</persName> said that this obviously
         raises the entire question of the validity of our support to Formosa. Why should we be
         spending several hundreds of millions of dollars and pouring in military supplies and
         equipment if we are not willing to take the additional steps necessary to insure against a
         collapse. We are faced with several distasteful conclusions: <list>
          <label>a.</label>
          <item>As matters now stand, we are allowing a useful potential to waste away and are
           merely throwing good money after bad.</item>
          <label>b.</label>
          <item>It would appear that our present methods cannot be expected to unseat the Communist
           regime, and that the adoption of the additional military measures to accomplish this
           result at this time would risk our involvement in a general war, at least against China,
           and possibly Russia as well.</item>
          <label>c.</label>
          <item>If we withhold or withdraw our aid now, Formosa will collapse in short order.</item>
         </list></p>
        <p>With respect to this latter point, <persName corresp="#p_BGON1">General
          Bradley</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> has repeatedly taken
         the position that the loss of Formosa would be highly damaging to our over-all strategic
         position, but that this was not sufficiently critical to warrant our putting in U.S. forces
         to hold Formosa.</p></item>
       <label>19.</label>
       <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NFC1">Nash</persName> stated that the decision of the <gloss
         target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> had, as he understood it, been to review the entire situation
        and not just one or two isolated features of it. He proposed that a working group comprised
        of State, Defense, <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
        and <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> representatives should immediately address itself to
        the broader task.</item>
       <label>20.</label>
       <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> agreed that this was the problem. He
        said there should be an immediate study of everything that can be done to solidify and
        stabilize the situation on Formosa.</item>
       <label>21.</label>
       <item><persName corresp="#p_BGON1">General Bradley</persName> also agreed and added that he
        would like to adopt Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName>’s proposal of a slight
        modification of the pertinent language of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 48/5. He also
        said that he thought subparagraphs (d) and (e) of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
        paper of 22 March represent existing policy and therefore raise no new questions.</item>
       <label>22.</label>
       <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> remarked that General
         <persName>Chase</persName><note n="5" xml:id="d106fn5">Chief of the Military Assistance
         Advisory Group, Formosa.</note> had said when he was here that the average age of the
        Chinese Nationalist forces on Formosa was some four years younger than the average age of
        the Division which he had led in the invasion of the Philippines. (Mr. <persName

        recommendation that a five-ply working group needs to study the problem in the broad context

        continue its participation in this examination of the problem, not only because of what we
        might be able to contribute from the intelligence standpoint but also because of the large
        operational stake which we have in the outcome of the deliberation. He reminded <persName

        no wish to continue the conduct of such large-scale operations and that <persName

        to divest himself of this responsibility if only the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> or
        someone else would pick it up. These remarks prompted a ripple of polite laughter around the
        table, and <persName corresp="#p_BGON1">General Bradley</persName> stated (with a smile and
        a bow towards Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>) that he saw no reason to

       <item>Report by the Director of Central Intelligence</item>
      </list>
      <p>In July 1949, the National Security Council directed that certain changes be made in the
       organization of the Central Intelligence Agency. The instructions contained in this
        Directive—<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 50<note n="2" xml:id="d107fn2">See <ref
         target="frus1945-50Intel#d384"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1945–1950,
         Emergence of the Intelligence Establishment, Document 384</ref>.</note>—have been carried
       out in all substantial respects.</p>
      <p>There is attached, marked Tab A, a chart of the organization of the Central Intelligence
       Agency as of October 1950 and an organization chart as of 31 December 1951. A comparison of
       these charts will indicate the general scope of this reorganization.</p>
      <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0280"/>
      <p>Specifically, there has been established an Office of National Estimates to produce
       intelligence estimates of national concern, both in acute situations and on a long-term
       basis. In its operations this Office utilizes the resources of the total United States
       intelligence community. The members of the Council are acquainted with the production of the
       Office of National Estimates, but, for ready reference, there is attached, marked Tab B, a
       list of the National Intelligence Estimates which were prepared in 1951.<note n="3"
        xml:id="d107fn3">Not printed.</note></p>
      <p>To provide the National Security Council and appropriate offices of the Government with
       all-source intelligence on a current basis, there was also established during 1951 an Office
       of Current Intelligence. Council members are acquainted with the publications of this
       Office.</p>
      <p>An Office of Research and Reports has been set up to provide coordinated intelligence,
       primarily on economic matters, as a service of common concern to interested Government
       agencies. Although accurate appraisal of an enemy’s economic potential is a most important
       factor in estimating his military capabilities, this crucially-important task had previously
       been scattered among twenty-four separate agencies of the Government.</p>
      <p>An Interdepartmental Economic Intelligence Committee has also been established, and the
       Agency’s Assistant Director for Research and Reports is its Chairman. His Office is the
       clearing house for study and analysis of the economy of the Soviet Orbit and for exploring
       and filling the gaps that had developed in the previously unrelated system of collection and
        evaluation.<note n="4" xml:id="d107fn4">See <ref target="#d72">Documents 72</ref> and <ref
         target="#d73">73</ref>.</note></p>
      <p>In cooperation with the Department of Defense, there has been established the
       Interdepartmental Watch Committee. Its function is to provide constant and periodic review of
       indications of possible enemy action. The Central Intelligence Agency also maintains a
       twenty-four hour watch on behalf of the Agency.<note n="5" xml:id="d107fn5">See <ref
         target="#d91">Document 91</ref>.</note></p>
      <p>Continuity of high caliber personnel, possessing specialized training and experience, is
       essential for the conduct of the Agency’s activities. Accordingly, plans for a career service
       within the Central Intelligence Agency are being worked out and the first groups of
       prospective junior career officers are in training.</p>
      <p>After sufficient career personnel have been recruited and trained in this service, it will
       be possible eventually to select senior officials of the Central Intelligence Agency from
       among their number. This development will take time. Meanwhile, one of the Agency’s
       continuing <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0281"/>problems will be the difficulty of
       securing adequately qualified personnel, particularly for senior positions.</p>
      <p>Four <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> papers approved during the period under review
       required the special services of the Central Intelligence Agency: <list>

         responsibility abroad of the Central Intelligence Agency with respect to handling

         for interrogating and caring for the high level defectors, [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not

         disappointing. Studies are being made of inducement programs to improve this situation, and
         appropriate recommendations will be made in due course to the Interagency Defector
         Committee. It should be noted in this connection that the care and rehabilitation of
         escapees and refugees, as distinguished from high level defectors, are not, and should not
         be, a Central Intelligence Agency responsibility. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not

        <item>The third <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper—<gloss target="#t_NSC1"
          >NSC</gloss> 66/1<note n="7" xml:id="d107fn7">For <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
          66/1, “Intelligence Support for the Voice of America With Regard to Soviet Jamming,” see
           <ref target="#d46">Document 46</ref>.</note>—directed the Central Intelligence Agency to
         provide intelligence support for the Voice of America with respect to Soviet jamming. This
         is being done, but the establishment of an additional monitoring facility to locate Soviet
         jamming stations, requested by <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 66/1 of the Armed Forces
         Security Agency has not been performed, due to technical difficulties. The National
         Security Council subsequently authorized the Central Intelligence Agency and the Department
         of State to implement this aspect of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 66/1 as a pilot
         operation, pending further consideration of the plan on technical grounds within the
         Department of Defense structure. This is being done.</item>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item>The remaining paper—<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/5<note n="8"
          xml:id="d107fn8"><ref target="#d90">Document 90</ref>.</note>—redefines the Central
         Intelligence Agency’s responsibilities in a field which was probably not envisaged at the
         time the National Security Act of 1947, under which the Agency was established, was framed.
         This is the field of cold war covert activities, including guerrilla warfare. We have
         accepted these responsibilities as agents for the major Departments concerned and for
         projects which are approved by the Psychological Strategy Board. The Departments of State
         and Defense are charged with providing the Central Intelligence Agency with the necessary
         support to accomplish these missions. The presently projected scope of these activities
         has, during the <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0282"/>past three years, produced a
         three-fold increase in the clandestine operations of this Agency and will require next year
         a budget three times larger than that required for our intelligence activities. These cold
         war projects are worldwide in scope (with the effort intensified in the Far East) and they
         include psychological warfare as well as paramilitary operations; denial programs with
         respect to strategic materials; stockpiling on a limited scale in strategic areas to assist
         the military in the event of war; the organization and planning of sabotage teams to
         support resistance operations; and the planning and organization of escape and evasion
         networks and stay-behind movements for use in the event of war.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>Given the necessary support, it will be possible for the Central Intelligence Agency to
       fulfill these requirements; but since they have resulted in such a large expansion in the
       Agency’s budget and personnel strength, it should be noted that: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>They are not functions essential to the performance by Central Intelligence Agency of
         its intelligence responsibilities.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>They were placed in this Agency because there was no other Department or Agency of the
         Government which could undertake them at that time.</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>They will inevitably militate against the performance by Central Intelligence Agency
         of its primary intelligence functions and are a continuing and increasing risk to its
         security. Regrettably, (from my personal viewpoint) it seems impracticable, for reasons of
         coordination and security, to divorce these from other covert operations.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>There remain a number of unsolved problems—major and minor. The following examples will
       indicate their nature and range: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item><hi rend="italic">Interrelationship Between Intelligence and Operational
         Planning</hi>. It is not necessary for an intelligence officer to know very much about
         plans, either civilian or military, but if his product is to be timely he must have
         adequate advance information at least of the general nature and objectives of any plans
         toward which he can make an intelligence contribution, as well as of such national or
         international policies and agreements as precede them. The liaison arrangements of <gloss
          target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and the Department of State on such matters are reasonably
         satisfactory, although there remains room for betterment. Such arrangements with the Armed
         Services are still somewhat less than satisfactory, although some improvement is being
         made.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item><hi rend="italic">Security</hi>. The utmost diligence has been exercised to insure the
         security of the Central Intelligence Agency, and I am now convinced that it is at least as
         secure as any activity of the Government. My remaining concern in this regard is largely
         based on the fact that the Agency is scattered among twenty-eight buildings in the
         Washington area. Every effort will be made to obtain funds for the construction of a
         reasonably secure building.</item>
        <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0283"/>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item><hi rend="italic">Communications Intelligence</hi>. Responsibility for this activity
         is presently divided. It is of particular concern since it affects a highly important
         source of raw intelligence. The President has directed that a survey be made by the
         Secretaries of State and Defense, assisted by the Director of Central Intelligence, to
         determine what, if any, organizational changes might improve the security and productivity
         of this service. This survey is now in progress under the supervision of an independent
         committee, appointed for the purpose.<note n="9" xml:id="d107fn9">See <ref target="#d97"
           >Documents 97</ref> and <ref target="#d99">99</ref>.</note></item>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item><hi rend="italic">Scientific and Technical Intelligence</hi>. The least progress in
         coordinating intelligence activities has been made in certain fields of scientific and
         technical intelligence. An interagency committee is presently studying this problem, with
         the view of recommending the proper steps for the improvement of this situation.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>The Council is generally acquainted with the Central Intelligence Agency’s secret
       operations designed to produce raw intelligence. Although we are making every effort to
       develop these latter sources, our experience so far has been in general disappointing. They
       are costly by comparison with other intelligence operations and they present in most cases a
       gambler’s chance of obtaining really significant critical strategic information, although
       they consistently produce a significant quantity of useable information. We must and shall
       devote our best effort to their improvement and to the exploitation of every reasonable
       chance for penetration. On a few rare occasions there have been really brilliant
       accomplishments.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, it should be pointed out that, in view of the efficiency of the Soviet
       security organization, it is not believed that the present United States intelligence system,
       or any instrumentality which the United States is presently capable of providing, including
       the available intelligence assets of other friendly states, can produce strategic
       intelligence on the Soviet with the degree of accuracy and timeliness which the National
       Security Council would like to have and which I would like to provide. Moreover, despite the
       utmost vigilance, despite watch committees, and all of the other mechanics for the prompt
       evaluation and transmission of intelligence, there is no real assurance that, in the event of
       sudden undeclared hostilities, certain advance warning can be provided.</p>
      <p>As far as our intelligence production is concerned, the Central Intelligence Agency is
       basically an assembly plant for information produced by collaborating organizations of the
       Government, and its final product is necessarily dependent upon the quality of the
       contributions of these collaborating organizations.</p>

      <p rend="center">BRIEFING TO THE PSYCHOLOGICAL STRATEGY BOARD ON SOME 10/5 PROBLEMS</p>
      <p rend="center">A. The Purpose of the Briefing</p>
      <p>The word “briefing” on the agenda is somewhat misleading. I should be extremely reluctant
       to “brief” the Board on 10/5,<note n="2" xml:id="d108fn2"><ref target="#d90">Document
         90</ref>.</note> as each of you already has considerable familiarity with the subject,
       quite aside from the fact that <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> is the
       undisputed expert. What I am really doing is asking for a “briefing in reverse”; or, in other
       words, seeking the Board’s help and guidance on behalf of the 10/5 Panel so that it can
       function as the Board’s screening agent, as completely and intelligently as possible. Study
       of the famous “Packet” has shown us as members of the Panel that there are some issues which
       should be submitted for Board consideration.</p>
      <p rend="center">B. Summary of the Steps Leading Up to the Briefing</p>
      <p>To provide the proper framework for the issues which we wish to raise, I believe it will be
       of advantage to review briefly the background of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
       10/5.</p>
      <p><gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2, approved by the President in June 1948,<note

        >OPC</gloss> (then called the Office of Special Projects) on behalf of the U.S. Government.
       The <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> was given the ultimate responsibility and was
       instructed to ensure, through representatives of State and Defense, that such covert
       operations were consistent with U.S. policy. The 10/2 Representatives, consisting of
        <persName corresp="#p_MBGJUSA1">General Magruder</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BBGJD1"
        >General Balmer</persName>, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JRP1">Joyce</persName>, have been
       meeting with the Chief of <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> each week to give such policy
       guidance. In addition, there is day-to-day liaison by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>,
       not only with State and Defense, but also with other appropriate departments and
       agencies.</p>

       placed on <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> by State, Defense, and the <gloss

        <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> that the covert program was fast expanding beyond the
       horizons seen at the time of its creation. Accordingly, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
       sought additional guidance from <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> in the “Scope and Pace”
       or “Magnitude” Paper of May 8, 1951,<note n="5" xml:id="d108fn5">Attachment to <ref
         target="#d68">Document 68</ref>.</note> in which were set forth two fundamental issues,
       clarification of which was considered essential to orderly growth. These were— <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>High policy approval of increases in personnel and expenditures required by requested
         programs, but going beyond limits thought to have been intended by <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
          >NSC</gloss> in June 1948, plus approval of substantial additional increases, if all the
         programs being thrust upon <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> were even to be
         attempted;</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>High policy decisions as to the direction and nature of covert operations.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>[<hi rend="italic">2 paragraphs (12 lines) not declassified</hi>]</p>
      <p>With respect to the direction and nature of the covert program <gloss target="#t_OPC1"
        >OPC</gloss> was faced with major decisions. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> interpreted
       the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 68 Series as establishing the desirability of large
       scale covert operations but felt that these policies had not been translated into a directive
       sufficiently specific for the operational guidance of <gloss target="#t_OPC1"
       >OPC</gloss>.</p>
      <p>Here is a sampling of the kind of decisions then troubling <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss>: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>Should <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> emphasize covert activities in support of
         cold war or in support of preparation for hot war? For example, should <gloss
          target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> properly give top priority to a European retardation plan as
         requested by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>?</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>How should <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> resolve the differing military and
         political concepts relating to the build-up, maintenance and use of resistance
         groups?</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>Should activities, such as paramilitary, be changed from covert to overt? If so, when
         and how?</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>These basic problems prompted <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to ask for guidance in
       four areas: (1) the scope and pace of covert operations for cold war and preparation for hot
       war; (2) redetermination of responsibilities for covert operations; (3) assurance of
       logistical support; and (4) coordinated guidance from <gloss target="#t_PSB1"
       >PSB</gloss>.</p>
      <p>The <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> responded to the “Magnitude” Paper in <gloss
        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/5, approved by the President on October 23, 1951. This
       stated that the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> “approves in principle as a national
       responsibility the immediate expansion of the covert organization established in <gloss
        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2”, thereby <pb n="259" xml:id="pg_259" facs="0288"
       />answering at least in part the primary <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> worry as to
        <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>’s increase in size. This answer, however, merely
       emphasizes the rest of 10/5, which is devoted to the question of objectives and how to
       develop a covert program.</p>
      <p>Obviously, the best size for <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> can never be determined
       with engineering accuracy. But equally obviously, the size of <gloss target="#t_OPC1"
        >OPC</gloss> should be responsive, in a general way, to various considerations, among which,
       in our opinion, are three important ones that will be discussed in greater detail in a
       moment. These considerations are: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>What are the correct interpretations of national objectives?</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>What is the national program for achieving them?</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>How large can the <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> program become without
         disclosing the hand of the U.S.?</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>As to objectives the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> called for an intensification of
       covert operations designed to: (1) place maximum strain on the Soviet structure of power; (2)
       contribute towards retraction of Soviet power and influence; (3) orient the free world
       towards the U.S., and (4) develop resistance and guerrilla operations.</p>
      <p>With regard to program, 10/5 in effect says to <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, “We
       recognize your need for guidance; we will not spell it out for you ourselves; we will,
       however, provide you with a mechanism which should resolve your dilemmas.”</p>
      <p>The mechanism was <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss>, then a young and only just
       fluttering fledgling. <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> was directed to include in its
       strategic concept provision for covert operations to achieve the objectives just mentioned.
       Moreover, <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> was given the responsibility for: (1)
       determining desirability and feasibility of covert programs and major projects, and (2)
       establishing the scope, pace, and timing of covert operations.</p>
      <p>In furtherance of these responsibilities, the Board on February 27, 1952 approved the
       creation of a panel that includes the 10/2 Representatives already described, plus two <gloss
        target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> members, <persName>Barnes</persName> and
        <persName>Putnam</persName>. At the same time, an administrative procedure was adopted for
       reviewing programs and projects.<note n="6" xml:id="d108fn6">See <ref target="#d104">Document
         104</ref>.</note></p>
      <p>On March 20, 1952, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> submitted to <gloss target="#t_PSB1"
        >PSB</gloss> the “Packet”, which consists of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>/<gloss
        target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> Strategic Plan, a Budget Analysis for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
        >FY</gloss> 1953, Programs and Major Projects over $50,000, and their Support Requirements—a
       total documentation of about 300 pages, including descriptions of some 100-odd projects.<note
        n="7" xml:id="d108fn7">The “Packet” has not been found, but several documents dealing with
        Department of State consideration of it are in National Archives, RG 59, S/P Files: Lot 64 D

      <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0289"/>
      <p>The 10/5 Panel has now studied the “Packet”, in the light of 10/2, the “Magnitude” Paper,
       10/5 and other <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> papers. This study has convinced us that
       many of the “Magnitude”-type issues still demand clarification and that serious Board
       consideration is essential. Whatever time may be required for this consideration, however,
       the Board in our opinion need not delay its approval of much, perhaps all, of the
       “Packet”.</p>
      <p rend="center">C. Approval of the “Packet”</p>
      <p>Without prejudice to any strategy which <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> may later
       evolve, via the <persName corresp="#p_SVARLC1">Stevens</persName> Group or by other means;
       without prejudice to further analysis of the “Packet” (such as the information which has been
       requested by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> representative in order to provide more
       readily comparable figures on supporting personnel and materiel being supplied by Defense);
       and without prejudice to questions which any of the Board may wish to ask; it is our belief
       that in general the “Packet” should be endorsed.</p>
      <p>Despite the rapid growth of <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>, the total <gloss
        target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953 program still only calls for about one per cent of the
       federal budget and, at most, only [<hi rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>] men.</p>
      <p>Unquestionably, the establishment of facilities and the training of personnel are the top
       priority needs of <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> today.</p>
      <p><gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> can reasonably continue this build-up without losing
       operating flexibility. In the meantime, the individual training plus the consolidation of
       organization will be assets to <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> whatever jobs are assigned
       to it in the future. Consequently, although no decision is today requested of the Board, the
       10/5 Panel does plan soon to submit the “Packet”, or as much of it as is appropriate, to the
       Board for its approval.</p>
      <p>Obviously, any Board approval of an <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> Packet must be
       subject to continuous review, as national policy evolves.</p>
      <p>But, in particular, the approval which the 10/5 Panel will soon recommend to the Board must
       be subsequently reviewed by both the Panel and the Board in the light of future
       clarifications of national policy and objectives.</p>
      <p rend="center">D. Certain Unresolved Issues</p>
      <p>Our study of the “Packet” has made us realize that soon the Board is to be presented with
       some difficult but unavoidable issues.</p>
      <p>To eliminate any possible ambiguity—the Board will not be expected to <hi rend="italic"
        >make</hi> policy, but if the 10/5 Panel is to operate, it needs some <hi rend="italic"
        >interpretations</hi> of policy.</p>
      <p>For example, before the Board, or the Panel acting for it, can pass on the “desirability”
       of a project as required by 10/5, it seems to us that the Board must provide answers to quite
       a number of basic questions, of which I will give two rather closely related examples: <pb
        n="261" xml:id="pg_261" facs="0290"/>
       <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item><p>Does U.S. policy, as properly interpreted, contemplate supplying overt physical
          support to revolutionary factions that might emerge in the wake of
           <persName>Stalin</persName>’s death, if the situation offered a reasonable chance of
          changing a regime to suit U.S. interests without precipitating general war?</p>
         <quote rend="blockquote">
          <p>It seems to us that if U.S. policy excludes this possibility, then <gloss
            target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> would prepare for quite a different program than it would
           if U.S. policy either included the possibility of such overt physical support or merely
           reserved to the nation the freedom to make the decision at a later date.</p>
         </quote></item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>Does U.S. policy, as properly interpreted, include or exclude efforts under any
         circumstances to overthrow or subvert the governments of the satellites or the <gloss
          target="#t_USSR1">U.S.S.R.</gloss>?</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>If U.S. policy excludes such efforts, then any <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> projects
       directed primarily or largely to those ends should be eliminated or should be retained only
       on the ground that preparations for such efforts may give the U.S. some freedom of
       decision.</p>
      <p>If, on the other hand, the answer is “yes”, or merely “maybe”, then, in order to have
       freedom of decision at the proper moment, it would seem important for the Board to know now,
       and for the 10/5 Panel to find out for the Board, how much military support and what type of
       military support will be available. For example, do we plan to go in on foot? If not, are
       airborne divisions available or on order? If on order, is the lead time synchronized with the
       estimated date of need?</p>
      <p>In stating these examples, no inference is intended that the Board is responsible for
       resolving the questions. However, in order that the Board may discharge its obligation with
       respect to the <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> program, it must, in our judgment, be
       fully acquainted with the answers from whatever source derived. The 10/5 Panel, in turn, must
       seek such answers when attempting to perform its delegated functions.</p>
      <p>The following passages from a lead article in the April 26, 1952, issue of the London <hi
        rend="italic">Economist</hi> express a similar dilemma in the public mind: <quote
        rend="blockquote">
        <p>“The discreet silence of western diplomacy about its hopes and purposes in Eastern Europe
         becomes more and more conspicuous.…</p>
        <p>“From the viewpoint of the <persName>Kremlin</persName> this silence of embarrassment
         must look like the silence of conspiracy. From London and Paris, from the land and sea
         stations of the Voice of America, from Radio Free Europe in Munich, and from such guerilla
         bases as Madrid and Belgrade and so-called ‘black’ stations, there comes hour after hour a
         stream of criticism and exhortation directed at the Soviet Union and its satellites. The
         effort is comparable only to that of the Cominform itself. To Moscow monitoring services
         and to the Russians who read analyses of western output, it must all look systematic and
         sinister. To experienced Communists, who themselves plan ahead and think in terms of
         political <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0291"/>warfare, it must seem incredible that
         all this activity is not harnessed to a plan for war and civil war among the western
         marches of the Soviet Union. <hi rend="italic">To encourage resistance by words and to have
          no intention of supporting it later by arms does not, the Russian would argue, make
          sense</hi>.” (emphasis supplied)</p>
        <p>“… the general atmosphere of conspiracy is heightened by the actual and alleged
         activities of the Central Intelligence Agency behind the Iron curtain.”</p>
        <p>“There can, indeed, be little doubt that there is in Eastern Europe a widespread belief
         that time will bring what the rulers call a war of aggression and what the ruled call
         liberation.”</p>
        <p>“… This is obviously an unsatisfactory state of affairs, which might become dangerous. It
         may mean that American and British policies are out of step and that there are two policies
         in Washington. It may mean that planning has moved from containment pure and simple to
         containment plus all such interference with the Russian sphere of influence as can be
         safely got away with.… In a decision to pass in Europe from containment to political,
         economic and social counterattack there is nothing whatever to be ashamed of.… What is
         wrong is that policy in such a matter should be formed piecemeal under the pressure of
         special requirements without any formulation of how far it is to go and what its ultimate
         objectives are to be.…”</p>
        <p>“… The policy of ‘containment plus’ is just beginning to hurt the East; but unless it is
         formulated and explained, public opinion will not support it and accept its
         consequences.”</p>

      <p rend="center">E. Responsibilities of the 10/5 Panel</p>
      <p>To assist in reaching a sensible working relationship between the Board and the 10/5 Panel,
       I am including in this final section some specific requests for guidance.</p>
      <list>
       <label>1.</label>
       <item><p>We should like the Board to confirm in principle the conclusion that <gloss
          target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> cannot create a useful apparatus unless it be authorized to
         develop an over-all program, in dollars and personnel, covering a period of, let us say,
         two or three years.</p>
        <p>The 10/5 Panel feels that <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>, like the Army, must be
         allowed to tailor its apparatus to an order of magnitude. It cannot today determine
         precisely what operation will be needed tomorrow any more than the Army can prophesy what
         particular campaign it will be directed to fight. The 10/5 procedure is presently focused
         on approval of particular programs and projects. If the 10/5 Panel should formalize and
         perpetuate this type of approval, to the exclusion of more general approval, it would tend
         to stultify <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>’s healthy development, especially if this
         procedure were in any way construed as requiring <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> to
         delay the creation and training of a useful apparatus until the Board had approved
         particular programs and projects.</p>
        <p>Such approval, of course, will not affect in any way the Board’s existing responsibility
         to review all particular programs and projects submitted under the 10/5 procedure.</p>
        <pb n="263" xml:id="pg_263" facs="0292"/>
        <p>It will, however, ensure <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> the flexibility essential
         for the development of quality as well as of quantity, and it will permit the 10/5 Panel to
         prepare an over-all program for Board consideration.</p>
        <p>Moreover, such approval in our opinion would be in keeping with the <gloss
          target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> decision in 10/5 already mentioned; namely, to approve “in
         principle as a national responsibility the immediate expansion of the covert organization
         established in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2…” This was an approval of an
         increase in order of magnitude.</p></item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item><p>With respect to the Panel’s job of screening particular programs and projects for
         the Board, the following are some suggested conclusions which are submitted for
         ratification by the Board. As you will see, they are efforts to hang flesh on the 10/5
         skeleton.</p>
        <list>
         <label>a.</label>
         <item><p>The 10/5 Panel should <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be called upon to act like a
           general manager of the program. This is properly the function of <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
            >CIA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>.</p>
          <p>For example, one project calls for [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
            declassified</hi>]. We believe that the <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> should <hi
            rend="italic">not</hi> be responsible for approving such matters as (1) the exact type
           or amount of stores cached, (2) the location of the caches, or (3) safeguards to prevent
           physical deterioration or loss of secrecy. Anything recommended by the Case Officer and
           approved by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and the 10/2 [<hi rend="italic"
           >10/5</hi>?] mechanism will be considered reasonable, in the absence of actual evidence
           to the contrary.</p>
          <p>The <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss>
           <hi rend="italic">should</hi> be responsible for determining that: <list>
            <label>(1)</label>
            <item>The procurement and caching of stores for retardation is reasonable;</item>
            <label>(2)</label>
            <item>[<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] is a reasonable country
             in which to prepare for retardation; and that</item>
            <label>(3)</label>
            <item>The scale of the effort is reasonable.</item>
           </list></p></item>
         <label>b.</label>
         <item><p>Other recommendations are: <list>
            <label>(1)</label>
            <item>That the 10/2 Representatives continue to provide the detailed, day-to-day
             guidance to <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, while the 10/5 Panel provides the more
             general guidance, including the strategic concepts to be developed by the <gloss
              target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss>. Details should be worked out between the 10/2
             Representatives and the 10/5 Panel.</item>
            <label>(2)</label>
            <item><p>That when a program appears to contribute towards the achievement of a national
              objective, but also appears either to be inconsistent with current national policy, or
              to be in an area where national policy is not clearly defined, the 10/5 Panel should
              bring the program to the attention of the Board.</p>
             <p>For example, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has two major programs for China:
              (a) support of Nationalist Government-controlled guerillas and resistance groups on
              the mainland [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>], and (b)
              support of “any and all” anti-Nationalist anti-communist resistance groups on the
              mainland [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]. Each program
              contributes towards the national objective of reducing communist power in China.</p>
             <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0293"/>
             <p>The programs, however, raise a basic question: Is U.S. Policy: (a) to strengthen the
              Nationalist Government as a rallying point for all anti-communist activities in China,
              (b) to encourage the development of a “Third Force” to assume control of all
              anti-communist activities in China at the expense of the Nationalists, or (c) to
              support at least for the time being both the Nationalist Government and to develop a
              “Third Force”.</p></item>
            <label>(3)</label>
            <item><p>That the 10/5 Panel may become concerned with the possible desirability of
              conducting a 10/5 program overtly rather than covertly.</p>
             <p>For example, the “Magnitude” paper points out that after guerilla forces have
              reached a certain size, attempts to maintain cover are ridiculous. Therefore, an
              increase in guerilla or resistance forces would require a further judgment as to the
              desirability of making the operation overt.</p></item>
           </list></p></item>
         <label>c.</label>
         <item>The 10/5 Panel should be authorized to ask questions designed to uncover hidden
          assumptions and implications in connection with any matter germane to the responsibilities
          delegated to it by the Board.</item>

       requested that this progress report, as of April 15, 1952, of activities undertaken in
       implementation of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 59/1, be circulated to the members of
       the Council for their information.</p>
      <p>2. The organization referred to in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 59/1 has been
       designated The Psychological Operations Coordinating Committee (POC). It will be referred to
       in this report as “the Committee.”</p>
      <p>3. This report describes only those foreign information operations and plans which, being
       interdepartmental in nature, were coordinated through the Committee.</p>
      <p>4. Consequent to a reorganization of foreign information activities within the Department
       of State, the Chairmanship of the Committee has been assumed by the Administrator,
       International Information Administration. The following are regularly represented at the
       weekly meetings of the Committee: Secretary of Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Mutual
       Security Agency, Central Intelligence Agency, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs,
       Department of State, and the Army, Navy <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0295"/>and Air
       Force chiefs of psychological warfare and the Psychological Strategy Board staff.</p>
      <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Troop Acceptability Program</hi></p>
      <p>An operational plan for handling psychological problems growing out of the presence of
       United States military personnel in Europe, has been approved by the Committee. The
       interdepartmental working group which prepared this plan is now preparing another for dealing
       with psychological problems connected with the presence of United States military personnel
       in other areas of the world.</p>
      <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Soviet-Dominated Military Personnel</hi></p>
      <p>A plan for conducting overt psychological operations vis-à-vis the armed forces of the
       Soviet-dominated world was prepared by an interdepartmental working group by direction of the
       Committee. The Committee also approved and referred to appropriate operating divisions a
       number of interdepartmentally-developed propaganda themes to be used in output directed
       towards military personnel of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and its captive
       countries.</p>
      <p>7. <hi rend="italic">General Assembly</hi></p>
      <p>On the Committee’s recommendation qualified information specialists were obtained from the
       Department of Defense and another agency to support the public information staff of the
       United States Delegation to the United Nations General Assembly in Paris in November, 1951.
       These officers provided valuable assistance to the Delegation in the conduct of its
       information operations.</p>
      <p>8. <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Anniversary</hi></p>
      <p>The Committee provided advice and support in the preparation of interdepartmental plans for
       a broad program of information activity of the U.S. and other <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
        >NATO</gloss> member countries to commemorate the third anniversary of the signing of the
       North Atlantic Treaty in April, 1952. The Committee and its staff participated in
       arrangements for the issuance of a special postage stamp commemorating the anniversary.</p>
      <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Television in Propaganda</hi></p>
      <p>An interdepartmental working group established by the Committee has laid the groundwork for
       interdepartmental cooperation in the further development of television as a propaganda
       medium.</p>
      <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Operations Newsletter</hi></p>
      <p>A “Psychological Operations Newsletter” is issued monthly by the Staff. The purpose of the
       newsletter is to keep appropriate officers of POC member agencies, both in Washington and in
       field establishments, informed of current activities in this field.</p>
      <pb n="267" xml:id="pg_267" facs="0296"/>
      <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Training Program</hi></p>
      <p>In accordance with the Committee’s recommendation, an expanded program of on-the-job
       training is being conducted in the State Department for military officers assigned to
       psychological warfare organizations. Fourteen officers have completed the six-months course,
       or are now following the course.</p>
      <p>12. <hi rend="italic">Project Nobel</hi></p>
      <p>The Committee has approved and referred to the International Information Administration in
       the Department of State, for implementation, a project designed to associate the living
       recipients of the Nobel peace prize with the ideals of the Free World.</p>
      <p>13. <hi rend="italic">Current Activities</hi></p>
      <p>Some of the more significant current activities of the Committee or its staff, in
       conjunction with the appropriate operating agencies, are as follows: <list>
        <label>a.</label>
        <item>Considering overt psychological warfare operations plans for handling Communist
         charges that UN Forces are using bacteriological warfare in Korea.</item>

         given by <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> of increased activities in
         this field, it would be well to indicate, in connection with this paragraph of the Progress

          “are reasonably satisfactory, although there remains room for betterment.” (Similar
          arrangements with the military services are described as “somewhat less than
          satisfactory.”) You <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0298"/>should know that since the
          issuance of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 50 on July 1, 1949, the Department has
          made intensive efforts to make available to <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> all
          information believed to be of concern to it. The Secretariat furnishes to <gloss
           target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> by rapid means a most comprehensive selection of the
          Department’s telegrams, including telegrams of a policy nature. Similar non-telegraphic

          and policy-making process, and the high degree of security required, it is very doubtful
          that intelligence will ever be fully satisfied with the state of its information in this

         <p>On the other hand, you should be aware that the flow of information described above is

          data are made available only as <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> determines that the
          Department’s interests are affected. Some information of direct concern to the Department
          is not made available and access to <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> telegrams, which
          would provide a check on the adequacy of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>’s practices

         report of January 1949,<note n="4" xml:id="d110fn4">For a summary of the <persName

         is based, took exception to the various current intelligence summaries (daily, weekly, and
         monthly) which were then being published by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. The
         Committee questioned the need for such publications, pointing out that they consisted
         almost entirely of summaries of departmental telegrams (90 percent State), including both
         operational and intelligence material. The result, according to the Committee, was “a
         fragmentary publication which deals with operations as well as intelligence, without
         necessarily being based on the most significant materials in either category.” The
         Committee concluded that (a) “in a summary of this type, circulated to the President and
         the highest officials of the Government, there is an inherent danger that it will be
         misleading to its consumers”; and (b) it duplicates at considerable expense of manpower and
         money, summaries circulated by the Department and other agencies.</item>
       </list></p>
      <pb n="270" xml:id="pg_270" facs="0299"/>
      <p>The production of these summaries has been improved and it is our understanding that the
       President finds them of great value which, in itself, is reason for a continued effort in
       their production. The Department, however, still finds many of the same objections that
       existed in 1949 and itself finds the summaries of little value. In particular, we are
       concerned that the summaries frequently are the vehicle whereby foreign policy problems, with
        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> comment, are brought to the attention of high officials
       of other agencies and the President, during the period when policy recommendations are being
       formulated and before the Department is prepared to suggest courses of action. We believe
       that with due regard for timeliness the provision of certain current intelligence to the
       President and to the operating agencies of the Government could and should be based on the
       same principles of contribution and coordination among the agencies as is now effected with
       respect to National Intelligence Estimates.</p>

         this Government is busily preparing to attack the Soviet Union? Will not the Russians point
         to these large and populous bases as evidence to support their thesis that the United

        <item>Is it a fact, as we understood <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>
         to believe a year ago, that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> planning for a hot war
         de-emphasizes and limits the effectiveness of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> as an

      <p>I believe that these questions trouble us here in the State Department. You may care to

      <p rend="flushleft">Dear <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>:</p>
      <p>As you know, National Security Council Intelligence Directive No. 10<note n="2"
        xml:id="d112fn2">For <gloss target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss> No. 10, see <ref
         target="frus1945-50Intel#d429"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1945–1950,
         Emergence of the Intelligence Establishment, Document 429</ref>.</note> places upon the
       Department of State primary responsibility for the collection abroad, by overt means, of
       information in the basic sciences. The Department, under this directive, has additional
       secondary responsibilities for collection in other scientific and technical fields.</p>
      <p>On a limited scale, the Department has, during the past two years, endeavored to meet these
       responsibilities. The experience gained during this period of time has confirmed the
       importance of several factors in the collection of scientific information: <list>
        <label>a.</label>
        <item>Except in the case of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and its satellites
         (including China), the traditional and normal channels of intercommunication between US and
         foreign scientists are capable of furnishing a large portion of the <pb n="274"
          xml:id="pg_274" facs="0303"/>information required for intelligence purposes. The normal
         channels comprise interchange of published works and scientific periodicals, reciprocal
         visits and attendance at international meetings and conferences.</item>
        <label>b.</label>
        <item>In the case of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and satellites, the limited
         information available through normal channels can be effectively supplemented only by
         carefully planned covert activities.</item>
        <label>c.</label>
        <item>In the case of non-Soviet areas, the information which is needed to supplement that
         received through the normal and traditional channels mentioned above principally relates
         either to a specific field of scientific effort and to research which has not yet reached
         the publication stage, or to an overall evaluation of scientific potential in one or more
         broad fields.</item>
        <label>d.</label>
        <item>The types of information mentioned in (c) above can be acquired most efficiently and
         economically through overt means, provided the following factors are kept in mind: <list>
          <label>1.</label>
          <item>The use of relatively young or scientifically unknown individuals will, in most
           cases, not only be ineffective, but may tend to dry up even the normal channels of
           intercommunication. Profitable contact with foreign scientists can usually be expected
           only where there is a reasonable quid pro quo, that is, when the US scientist is a
           qualified leader in a given field, and when the basis of the contact is a legitimate
           exchange of scientific ideas and experiences. Relatively unknown individuals who only ask
           questions quickly arouse resentment and reluctance, since it is obvious that their
           principal purpose is to extract information, giving nothing in return.</item>
          <label>2.</label>
          <item>Every effort must be made to keep the collection of basic scientific information
           removed from the taint of intelligence. Infraction of this principle may not only hinder
           the overt operation, but may jeopardize contacts and sources essential to the success of
           covert operations.</item>
          <label>3.</label>
          <item>The degree to which a US scientist can be successful in collecting information on a
           specific or general scientific field depends upon his own ability and competence in that
           field rather than upon any detailed briefing by intelligence.</item>
         </list></item>
       </list></p>
      <p>The Department is keenly aware of the importance of carrying out its responsibilities under
        <gloss target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss>–10, and desires to expand its current activities in
       this respect. The following steps should be taken in this direction, some of which can be
       accomplished within the Department’s present resources; others will require additional
       support.</p>
      <list>
       <label>a.</label>
       <item>The Department can collect the bulk of basic scientific material available in published
        form which <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> requires.</item>
       <label>b.</label>
       <item>The existing scientific attachés can undertake to collect specific additional
        information which <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> may require within their individual
        fields of competence.</item>
       <label>c.</label>
       <item>With appropriate financial assistance, known and competent specialists can be selected
        and sent overseas for limited periods of two to three months to cover specific fields of
        science on a strictly overt basis. <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0304"/>These consulants
        would function in the same manner as normal science attachés, and would make their reports
        to the office of the Science Advisor, Department of State. They would have no direct
        connection with <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> in any way.</item>
       <label>d.</label>
       <item>The office of the Science Advisor, with additional staffing assistance, could undertake
        a more extensive program of debriefing scientists and engineers who have visited foreign
        areas under private sponsorship. The use of this office, which while it has no apparent
        connection with intelligence, is directly and openly concerned with science, will in many
        cases be more fruitful than debriefing by the intelligence agencies themselves.</item>
       <label>e.</label>
       <item>With adequate financial assistance the Department can increase the competence and scope
        of coverage of US representation to international scientific conferences and congresses
        abroad. It is believed that such meetings are extremely profitable occasions for the
        interchange of scientific information and ideas, particularly in acquiring prepublication
        knowledge of work in progress.</item>
      </list>
      <p>In accordance with paragraphs 1,d and 1,f of <gloss target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss>–10,
       the above views and suggestions are submitted to the Central Intelligence Agency for
       consideration, both as to their validity, and as a basis for further discussion as to the
       degree of support to the overt scientific collection activities of the Department which might
       be appropriate and justifiable.</p>

       <item><hi rend="italic">Purpose</hi>. This instruction outlines an agreement between the
        Office of Naval Intelligence and the Central Intelligence Agency concerning the exploitation
        of maritime sources for intelligence purposes.<note n="2" xml:id="d113fn2">Known as the
         “Salt Water Agreement.”</note></item>

        instruction.</item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item><hi rend="italic">Background</hi>. The National Security Council places the
        responsibility for the collection of foreign intelligence from domestic sources with the
        Central Intelligence Agency. Because of the extensive naval interest in maritime matters,
        and the capabilities of the DIOs in exploiting this field, a mutually satisfactory agreement
        has been reached by <gloss target="#t_ONI1">ONI</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
         >CIA</gloss>.</item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item><hi rend="italic">Procedure.</hi>
        <list>
         <label>a.</label>
         <item><hi rend="italic">Counter-Intelligence and Security</hi>. The exploitation of
          maritime Sources, including but not limited to, masters, officers, crews, operators,
          owners and agents for counter-intelligence and security purposes, is the responsibility of
          the District Intelligence Officers without prior clearance or coordination with <gloss
           target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.</item>
         <label>b.</label>
         <item><hi rend="italic">Foreign Intelligence, Owners, Operators and Agents</hi>.
          Exploitation of owners, operators and agents for the purposes of foreign intelligence is
          the primary responsibility of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. If deemed advisable
          however, and subject to prior coordination with the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
          field office, these sources may be exploited for foreign intelligence purposes by the
          DIOs. Such interviews will be arranged, and at his option participated in, by the
          cognizant field representative of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. Primary
          responsibility of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> in this field does not restrict
          or affect in any way the responsibility of the DIOs under paragraph 4a of this
          instruction.</item>
         <label>c.</label>
         <item><hi rend="italic">Foreign Intelligence, Masters, Officers and Crews</hi>. The
          exploitation of masters, officers and crews of merchant vessels for foreign intelligence
          purposes is the responsibility of the DIOs. Direct access by <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
           >CIA</gloss> to such sources, in exceptional cases, is not precluded by this agreement;
          however such special interviews will be arranged by the DIOs.</item>

           <label>(1)</label>
           <item><hi rend="italic">Foreign Positive Intelligence</hi>. Foreign positive intelligence
            obtained by DIOs from maritime sources, either afloat or ashore, shall be made available
            to the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> field office for ultimate appropriate
            dissemination by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> in Washington. The DIOs shall
            simultaneously submit reports of such intelligence to <gloss target="#t_ONI1"
             >ONI</gloss> for dissemination within the Naval establishment. Every effort will be
            made to secure duplicate copies of enclosures, in order that the <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
             >CIA</gloss> field office and the DIO may <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0306"/>each
            forward a copy to Washington. In the event that only a single copy of enclosures is
            available, and reproduction is impracticable, they shall be forwarded to <gloss

            information secured under the SOMM plan<note n="4" xml:id="d113fn4">Not further
             identified.</note> will be forwarded to <gloss target="#t_ONI1">ONI</gloss> for
            analysis and dissemination. No lateral distribution of such reports will be made to

            furnishing foreign intelligence exclusively, whether connected with the maritime field
            or not, will be furnished to <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> field offices.</item>
           <label>(3)</label>
           <item><hi rend="italic">Overlapping Sources</hi>. It is considered probable that some
            maritime sources, as listed in paragraph 4c of this instruction, will also be classified
            by the DIOs as counter-intelligence informants or SOMM plan participants. The release of
            names of such sources to the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> field office is subject
            to the discretion of the DIO. Sufficient source description will be furnished the <gloss
             target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> field office to obviate false confirmation, but extreme
            care is urged in such disclosure that sensitive sources supplying both types of
            information are not jeopardized.</item>

         <item><hi rend="italic">Requirements</hi>. <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> requirements
          for foreign intelligence from sources in paragraph 4c of this instruction will be
          coordinated by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, as necessary. General Navy
          requirements covering the exploitation of these sources are presently in the hands of the
          DIOs, and further specific requirements will be furnished from time to time by <gloss
           target="#t_ONI1">ONI</gloss>. DIOs will make every effort to alert the pertinent <gloss
           target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> field office to the arrival of ships from high priority
          areas, or of unusual foreign intelligence potential. In such cases a <gloss
           target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> representative may furnish interagency requirements or
          participate in the interview if necessary.</item>

         <item><hi rend="italic">DIO–<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Field Office
           Relationship</hi>. It is manifestly impossible to exactly delimit all rights,
          responsibilities or privileges under an interagency agreement, such as this one, developed
          within the framework of <gloss target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss> No. 7.<note n="5"

             Relations</hi>, 1945–1950, Emergence of the Intelligence Establishment, Document
            427</ref>.</note> It is possible, however, to fashion such an agreement into an
          effective instrument for the complete intelligence exploitation of the maritime field. The
          catalyst required is an amicable working relationship between the DIOs and the <gloss
           target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> field offices, which can only be based upon a sympathetic
          understanding of each other’s problems and a desire to cooperate in a common effort.
          District Intelligence Officers are directed to make every effort consistent with existing
           <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0307"/>directives to formulate such a working
          relationship at the earliest moment, and resolve such local problems as arise in

         <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> stated that a component of the

         the military intelligence agencies. The <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> satisfies the
         intelligence requirements of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> and, although willing
         to satisfy a need of such organizations as RDB, if practicable, will be glad to have such
         needs satisfied elsewhere. In response to a question <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General

         willing to give informal assistance to the military analysts, to the extent that was

         estimates and assumes no responsibility therefor. If it should develop that the <gloss

         the RDB request is not withdrawn, then the <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> stated he
         would expect to try to satisfy the request on a community basis.</item>

      <p>Pursuant to Reference A, the Senior <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Staff requested the

       to prepare a study of the desirability and feasibility of the initiation of a preclusive

      <p rend="flushleft">Dear Doc:</p>
      <p>I propose in this letter to speak about matters of such delicacy that I want you to know
       before you get into it that it is a letter of which I am keeping no copy, and one which you
       will probably wish to destroy as soon as you have read it.</p>
      <p>Since my arrival in Moscow I have become increasingly aware of a situation which not only
       gives me great concern but which seems to involve a very important question of principle
       concerning the attitude of our Government as a whole toward this mission and the functions
       which it is supposed to perform. I am prepared to go ahead and decide these questions on my
       own formal responsibility here, but in doing so I wish to make sure that the situation is
       clearly understood in Washington and that my decision here is in accord with the view of
       authoritative circles in our Government. It is for this reason that I am mentioning the
       matter to you.</p>
      <p>I find upon arrival here and upon closer acquaintance with the activities of the staff that
       during the past two or three years this mission—and by that I mean its personnel, premises
       and extraterritorial status—has been intensively and somewhat recklessly exploited by the
       military intelligence-gathering agencies of the Government for their particular purposes.
       Their representatives here have, I am afraid, been encouraged by their home offices to
       utilize intensively such facilities as they enjoy here by virtue of their diplomatic status,
       for the purpose of assembling every possible shred of information on military subjects. I do
       not find that their instructions have called upon them to take adequate account of the
       effects their actions might have on the straight political and diplomatic potential of the
       mission, or on those very privileges and facilities from which they were profiting. So far as
       I can analyze the point of view which lies behind these activities, it is one which has not
       considered the diplomatic potential of this mission as a factor to be seriously taken into
       account, and which assumes the very existence of the mission as a short term provisorium, to
       be ruthlessly and intensively exploited while it lasts.</p>
      <pb n="284" xml:id="pg_284" facs="0313"/>
      <p>I would like to be able to list for you a number of the factual incidents which lead me to
       make these observations. Actually, I cannot bring myself to put them on paper for obvious
       reasons. I can only say the following about them: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>Many of them are quite shocking and surprising, almost incredible to anyone who has
         had any extensive familiarity with the diplomatic profession.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>In several instances little or no effort has been made to avoid detection by the
         Soviet authorities. In certain instances actions have been performed here under the very
         lenses of Soviet photographers appointed for the purpose of photographing them, and those
         actions were ones which the Soviet Government had specifically warned us were contrary to
         local law.</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>Many of these actions seem to me to have been of a childish and “Boy Scout” nature,
         which, in addition to serving as proof to the Soviet Government of systematic misuse of our
         diplomatic status, must have brought smiles to the faces of higher Soviet authorities and
         cannot have contributed to Soviet respect for the mission.</item>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item>Many of the targets are ones which I think could easily have been reached by other and
         less dangerous methods.</item>
        <label>5.</label>
        <item>In general, these activities have been the result not of spontaneous initiative on the
         part of the men out here, but of pressures put upon them by their own superiors in
         Washington.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>These activities have had and are having three effects which I think it is important for
       our Government to note: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item><p>They are self-defeating in that they lead to a steady and gradual curtailment of
          the very facilities which they exploit.</p>
         <p>I have no doubt whatsoever that the curtailment of travel for this mission represents a
          reaction of the Soviet authorities to the extensive exploitation of travel facilities by
          this and other missions for purposes which cannot be viewed by them as legitimate. The
          same is true of the drastic and total isolation of the diplomatic corps here, including
          even neutral missions, from contact with the Soviet people. These things have probably had
          a good deal to do with the extraordinary pressures put on the servant and custodial staffs
          of diplomatic missions. If they are continued, we must expect a steady increase in the
          severity of these restrictions to a point where life will become practically impossible
          for foreigners in this city unless they wish to sit like prisoners within their buildings
          and be served by imported servants. The upshot of this is that activities of this nature
          must be predicated upon a lack of concern for maintenance of those very facilities whose
          existence they assume and exploit.</p></item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item><p>These activities have a deleterious effect on the actual diplomatic potential of
          the mission, i.e., of its value as a political reporting <pb n="285" xml:id="pg_285"
           facs="0314"/>unit and a channel of communication with the Soviet Government, and have
          already probably reduced its possibilities significantly in these fields.</p>
         <p>What has been said above about the exhaustion of these channels for intelligence
          purposes has its application in even greater degree to the normal purposes that these
          facilities were supposed to serve. With the increasing isolation of the diplomatic corps,
          the curtailment of travel facilities, and the constant increase in Soviet vigilance
          vis-à-vis foreigners, you have the ruin of those last vestigial positions which made
          possible, even in a minor way, something resembling normal life and travel in this
          country. Not only that, but one cannot help feeling that the attitude of members of the
          Soviet Government and officials of the Foreign Office toward individual diplomatic
          officers of our mission must be affected by what they know of the uses to which the
          mission is daily being put. This applies particularly to the ambassador here, for the
          Soviet authorities can only conclude either that he is aware of and responsible for this
          employment of his mission, or that he is not aware of it or is powerless to stop it. In
          the first case, they must regard him as the major offender. In either of the latter cases
          they must regard him as a secondary figure-head who is only being put up for formal and
          protocol purposes like their own ambassadors abroad. I hardly need emphasize to you how
          serious a factor this is. In the end, the great political judgments about the nature of
          Soviet power, its psychology and its intentions, are of vastly greater importance to our
          Government than detailed tidbits of tactical information about the Soviet armed forces,
          much of which can be obtained in other places of (if really well-trained people are used)
          by other and more desirable methods. Yet we are seriously handicapped, in our ability to
          arrive at these major judgments, by the retaliatory actions brought upon us by these
          peripheral activities of the mission. Furthermore, the maintenance of the mission as a
          channel of communication with the Soviet Government is something which may be rarely of
          practical importance but when the moment does come that it is of any value at all, then
          its importance can be enormous. In the burdening and reduction of the ambassadorial
          position by the tolerance of these activities our Government is really taking a heavy
          responsibility in the face of the uncertainties of the future.</p></item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>The continuance of this type of activity actually places in jeopardy, in my opinion,
         the physical security of the members of the mission and their families.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>Thus far the Soviet authorities have been very correct in this respect, and no American
       official or employee has, in recent years, suffered (to my knowledge) any physical damage or
       open unpleasantness. However, we know very well that the Soviet authorities are assembling a
       careful, and, I fear, impressive record of all of our activities. The Grow <pb n="286"
        xml:id="pg_286" facs="0315"/>diary is only a small part, I am sure, of what they have in
       their pocket. We also know that in the more remote past there have been instances when unwise
       Americans met with physical violence, judicial summonses and other forms of unpleasantness.
       We must remember that our American employees here—and by this I mean all those persons not on
       the diplomatic list—are by Soviet usage completely devoid of diplomatic immunity for any
       violations of Soviet law. We have not seen fit to challenge seriously this position of the
       Soviet authorities. That means that these people are all extremely vulnerable and can in most
       instances very easily be framed and made subject to court action at any time.</p>
      <p>Finally, you have the several possibilities that out of the present delicate international
       situation there might arise either a rupture of relations between our countries or an actual
       state of war. In either of these events, I think it entirely possible, if not likely, that
       individual members of our staff, and perhaps the whole staff might suffer seriously by virtue
       of these activities that have been conducted in the past. Our Government must therefore
       realize that if it wishes such activities to be continued at this post, it cannot hold the
       ambassador and other officers of the mission responsible for the maximum safety of members of
       the staff in the face of possible consequences that may ensue.</p>
      <p>I am aware that this is hardly a matter on which direct written instructions can be issued
       to this mission, and not even one about which there can be official correspondence. I do not
       wish to place the Government in the position of having to give me any written instructions of
       an undesirable nature. I am therefore writing this letter to tell you, first of all, that I
       propose to issue orders to all members of this mission that they are expected to comply
       strictly with Soviet laws and regulations so far as they are known, and also they are to
       avoid every form of public behavior which might be expected to give the impression to local
       citizens and officials that they are engaged in improper activities. This applies
       particularly to the use of cameras, radio receiving sets, and other electrical and auditory
       devices, and to the visiting or inspection of installations or areas of a known military
       significance. I have already discussed these matters with the service attachés, who have
       taken my observations in good part. But one of them points out that this will mean important
       modifications in his policies and activities, and that these modifications are not apt to be
       agreeable to his home office.</p>
      <p>Secondly, I would like to ask that you call to the attention of the heads of the various
       intelligence-gathering agencies the fact that this is my intention, and that you ascertain
       whether any of them is in disagreement with this position and considers that it is, on
       balance, detrimental to United States interests.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, in case there is this feeling on the part of any of the responsible heads of the
       agencies involved, I would earnestly request <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0316"/>that
       you have this matter taken to a high interdepartmental agency for thorough discussion and
       settlement.</p>
      <p>Fourth, if my proposed position here meets with the full understanding and approval of the
       Government—so that I need not feel that any subsequent reproach will rest upon me or this
       mission for its conduct in this matter—then I will expect no reply of any sort to this
       communication, and I will understand that silence means consent.</p>
      <p>Fifth, if, on the other hand, it is the considered view of the appropriate higher
       authorities of our Government that the practices I have in mind are of an importance such as
       to override the disadvantages to which I have pointed, and if, therefore, it is the desire of
       the Government that I not alter any of the existing practices, then I would appreciate it if
       you could find means simply to inform me that my letter of this date has been duly considered
       but that the Government sees no grounds for alteration of existing practices. In such case,
       however, I want it clearly understood, both by the Secretary and the President, that I cannot
       properly be held responsible for such deterioration as may ensue in the value of this mission
       both as an observation post and as a channel of communication with the Soviet Government, or
       for any other unhappy consequences.</p>
      <p>I am sorry to have to write this letter, but if you will put yourself in my place you will
       see that I have no choice but to do so. I cannot allow to proceed a progressive deterioration
       in the actual diplomatic potential of a mission entrusted to my care, on a vague assumption
       that this is what the Government wants. On the other hand, I cannot, without at least
       apprising the Government of what I am doing and giving it an opportunity to overrule me, take
       administrative measures here which might later conceivably lead to my being charged with
       having deprived the United States Government of valuable information, and prejudiced the
       military interests of the country.<note n="2" xml:id="d118fn2">On July 7, <persName

       <p rend="flushleft">P.S. Two afterthoughts:</p>
       <p>I neglected to mention above that I am afraid the situation I have described in this
        letter has led to a certain amount of bitterness against this mission on the part of other
        missions in the city, who feel that their status has also been worsened and their
        opportunities reduced as a result of our activities. I think there is something in this, if
        we take into consideration, in addition to the activities discussed in this letter,
        indiscretions that have been committed by individual Americans in the form of publication or
        leakage of information about their relations with other missions and with Soviet citizens
        here.</p>
       <p>Secondly, I should make it plain that the reason I am addressing this letter to you now is
        that the first severe test of the policy I propose to enforce here will come in connection
        with the Soviet Air Force Day on June 28. I shall not be here myself, but I have given
        instructions through <persName corresp="#p_CHSJ1">Hugh Cumming</persName> that there is to
        be no photographing or listening activity on the roofs of Embassy premises here which can be
        detected and photographed from other roofs (as has been done in the past). If the consensus
        of authoritative opinion in Washington wish to indicate that to <persName corresp="#p_CHSJ1"
         >Hugh</persName> by telegraphic message as suggested above we will permit the activities;
        but my own feeling is that it is highly unwise and is bound to appear some day in a
        propaganda white book or some other disagreeable form, as proof of the systematic abuse by
        the American Embassy of its diplomatic status and of its violation of local Soviet laws and
        regulations.</p>

      <p>I have been giving consideration to the organization of the Psychological Strategy Board
       and particularly to the question of whether the directive of April 4, 1951,<note n="2"
        xml:id="d119fn2">See <ref target="#d60">Document 60</ref>.</note> establishing it should be
       amended. In addition to the recommendations of the Board’s first Director and the
       recommendations of the Board included in your useful and constructive memorandum of May
        16,<note n="3" xml:id="d119fn3">Not printed. (<persName corresp="#p_THS1">Truman</persName>
        Library, Papers of <persName corresp="#p_THS1">Harry S. Truman</persName>, Confidential
        File)</note> I have had the report of a study undertaken at my direction by the Director of
       the Bureau of the Budget.</p>
      <p>It is my view that, as you recommend, no change in the directive of April 4, 1951, or in
       the organization of the Board should be made at this time. The Board’s decision to rotate the
       chairmanship, with the Director taking his turn as presiding officer is consistent with the
       intent of the directive of April 4, 1951.</p>
      <p>Adjustments in the relationships of the Director with the National Security Council and of
       the Board with the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended in your memorandum similarly can be made
       within the framework of the existing directive and are consistent with it. I shall speak with
       the Executive Secretary of the National Security Council relative to the former. Appropriate
       representation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff with the Board can be arranged by the Secretary
       of Defense.</p>
      <p>I believe that it would be helpful to me if the Board could suggest occasions when I might
       become more directly informed of its work, particularly of its evaluation of the national
       psychological effort, through a meeting with the Board, the Director and the Executive
       Secretary of the National Security Council.</p>
      <p>I am transmitting the report of the Director of the Bureau of the Budget on the
       organization of the Psychological Strategy Board for study and appropriate action by the
        Board.<note n="4" xml:id="d119fn4">Attached but not printed is the April 21 report entitled
        “The Psychological Strategy Board: Selected Aspects of Its Concept, Organization and
        Operations.”</note> The report emphasizes the <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290" facs="0319"
       />primary usefulness of the Board as an instrument for more effective planning through the
       organized utilization of the resources of the participating agencies. The report further
       stresses the need for increased emphasis upon the Board’s responsibilities for forward
       planning and in the evaluation of the total national psychological effort. I particularly
       commend these sections of the report to the attention of the Board.</p>

       <p rend="center">Some Thoughts on the Problem of Scientific and Technical Intelligence</p>
       <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>In any country’s security system there are elements upon which the country in question
         places great store. These are truly its secrets of security.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>Generally speaking these secrets of security if they are not in themselves scientific
         and technical at least rest on scientific and technological developments. Ask yourself:
         Knowledge of what twenty US secrets of security would I be most concerned to keep from the
          <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>? How many of the twenty really lie outside the
         scientific/technical area?</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>The importance which a country attaches to any of these elements in its security
         system is an index of that country’s desire to keep them secret from all outsiders. Thus
         the more important they are the more difficult they become as intelligence targets.</item>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item>The security measures in operation in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> have
         been peculiarly successful in the scientific/technical areas. It would be my guess that in
         no part of our knowledge of Soviet secrets of security is the ratio of fixed points to
         voids so large. In the matter of the gadgets around which Soviet air defense capabilities
         are built, the paucity of fixed points is dramatic in the extreme.</item>
        <label>5.</label>
        <item>In the last analysis the mission of intelligence is to draw the meaningful and
         objective generalization from the data. <list>
          <label>a.</label>
          <item>If the data, or fixed points, are numerous and the voids between them small, then
           meaningful, objective, and probably correct generalizations can be drawn.</item>
          <label>b.</label>
          <item>If the data, or fixed points, are few and the voids between them large, meaningful
           generalizations can still be drawn. But who is to say that they are objective and/or
           probably correct? Who is to say they are anything but pure fiction?</item>
         </list></item>
        <pb n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0321"/>
        <label>6.</label>
        <item>In case 5b above, the generalizer, minimally confined and directed by fixed points,
         may be engulfed by forces wholly extraneous to the problem at hand. It is here that he may
         be consciously or unconsciously taken over by his hopes, his wishes, and his fears, or by
         those of his friends or the institution he works for. (I refer you to the men who have
         designed maps of the heavens and who have generalized the muscular Orion and his club,
         belt, and lion skin from a dozen or so stars.) What he comes up with is something far
         different from and usually far more or less than the meager suggestions of the fixed
         points. The added something is not from the data; it is from him.</item>
        <label>7.</label>
        <item>As long as the national intelligence community can fix only relatively few points in
         key scientific and technical developments of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
         as long as the voids between these points are very large, generalizations by any single
         individual or single intelligence institution may be dangerously skewed by individual wish
         or institution policy.</item>
        <label>8.</label>
        <item>Ask yourself: “What would I wish if my future were interwoven with that of one of the
         armed services?” You would wish to be a part of the best damn outfit of its sort in
         existence—an outfit that could deliver enough lethal power to destroy any enemy in a single
         attack and do it without losing a man.</item>
        <label>9.</label>
        <item>Ask yourself the next question: What do I do to get my wish?” If you are in
         intelligence you may do two things. <list>
          <label>a.</label>
          <item>To assure yourself that your service will get the funds to make it the best damn
           outfit of its sort in existence you will not play down the enemy. You will build him up,
           especially in gross terms of his offensive capability.</item>
          <label>b.</label>
          <item>To assure yourself that once you’ve got the best damn outfit in the world, it will
           carry out its mission you begin to take away from the enemy. You will take away notably
           in the area of his defensive capabilities. You are not quite so certain to do this as to
           build up his offensive capabilities, because of the perils involved. You know that if you
           significantly undervalue his defensive capabilities and plans are drawn upon your
           evaluation your service may be cruelly hurt in the clash. You finally fix the point of
           his defensive capabilities at the place where the curve of your wish intersects the curve
           of your fear. The fixed points are so few that you can easily draw your curves to
           accommodate them.</item>
         </list></item>
        <label>10.</label>
        <item>When you have done these two things you have done little more than describe the ideal
         enemy; the enemy big enough to warrant the perfection of your outfit, but an enemy who is
         nevertheless a pushover in a showdown.</item>
        <label>11.</label>
        <item>You can do this in the field of scientific and technical intelligence on the <gloss
          target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and no one can say you may [<hi rend="italic">nay?</hi>]
         so long as the ratio of fixed points to voids remains what it is.</item>
        <label>12.</label>
        <item>The above is a long way of spelling out my doubts as to the virtues of assigning to
         given departmental intelligence organizations a <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0322"
         />“primary” responsibility in any of the specific areas of scientific and technical
         intelligence. All along I have feared the generalizations, say, that <gloss
          target="#t_ONI1">ONI</gloss> may make of the fixed points and voids re Soviet underwater
         warfare techniques, that <gloss target="#t_G21">G–2</gloss> may make re Soviet tank design,
         that A–2 may make re Soviet GCI and A–2 radar and AAA. I have however been somewhat
         comforted by realizing that if any single service comes up with a wishful generalization,
         this generalization may be opposed to the wish of another service; that the other service
         will possess all the data of the first and that it will be capable of drawing its own
         variant or opposing generalization.</item>
        <label>13.</label>
        <item>If a service is duly invested with “primary” responsibility and if at the same time it
         possesses sources of information which it may or may not share with other services and if
         it chooses not to share, the chances of another service developing a variant or opposing
         generalization have shrunk considerably and may have shrunk to approximate zero.</item>
        <label>14.</label>
        <item>We are in a position today where we cannot anticipate either (a) a dramatic decrease
         in the ratio of voids to fixed points in the area of scientific and technical developments
         in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or (b) a dramatic change in human nature. As
         long as we do not take out insurance against the acceptance of a generalization that must
         perforce partake heavily of the wish, we are asking for trouble. If I were carrying the
         statutory responsibilities of the <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> the minimum insurance
         I would take out would be as follows: <list>
          <label>a.</label>
          <item>Keep O/<gloss target="#t_SI1">SI</gloss> in business pretty much as it is today—even
           endeavor to strengthen some of its divisions. The ones I would strengthen would be those
           dealing with the most important subject matter irrespective of whether another agency had
           been awarded “primary” responsibility in this subject matter.</item>
          <label>b.</label>
          <item>Set up a machinery to insure that no one scientific/technical intelligence outfit
           withheld information which it may have developed and which it found useful in drawing its
           own generalizations.</item>

       <label>1.</label>
       <item>After a careful study of the report of the <persName corresp="#p_BG1"
         >Brownell</persName> Committee, I have concluded that it presents a fair and essentially
        accurate picture of the history and development of <gloss target="#t_COMINT1">COMINT</gloss>
        and of its present functioning. I have followed closely the work of the Committee throughout
        their investigation and have been greatly impressed with their objective approach to and
        deep penetration of the extremely complicated problem which confronted them. It is my
        opinion that they have reached eminently sound conclusions.</item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>In those portions of the report containing historical and other background information,
        there are a few errors in fact, and also certain statements which may convey erroneous
        impressions. While these appear to have had no significant effect on the Committee’s
        obviously thorough understanding of the essentials involved, and their whole background, it
        is desirable that certain of these errors be set straight for the record; this is done in
        inclosure 1.<note n="4" xml:id="d121fn4">Not printed.</note></item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>In my opinion the organization of <gloss target="#t_COMINT1">COMINT</gloss> activities
        proposed by the <persName corresp="#p_BG1">Brownell</persName> Committee is both workable
        and practical at all three levels, subject to the comment given below. It would constitute
        an extension on a joint basis of the vertical principle of organization which, as the
        Committee points out, now exists in each of the three Armed Services separately. I regard as
        particularly important the degree of authority which the Committee proposes to vest in the
        Director of <gloss target="#t_AFSA1">AFSA</gloss>, an authority which, for the first time
        since the creation of the Agency, will be commensurate with his responsibilities.</item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item><p>It is noted that the Committee apparently intends that the responsibilities of the
         Director of <gloss target="#t_AFSA1">AFSA</gloss> be extended in the Communication Security
         field to embrace the production and protection of the <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295"
          facs="0324"/>codes and ciphers of the entire U.S. Government, rather than merely the
         Department of Defense as is now the case. I consider such an extension of jurisdiction in
         the Communication Security field to be desirable. However, the Committee has not seen fit
         to elaborate upon this proposal and, in fact, has included in its report very little
         comment on the problems involved. Moreover, the proposed directive contains no specific
         provisions as to organization above, within, or below <gloss target="#t_AFSA1">AFSA</gloss>
         for the purpose of conducting communication security activities on a national basis. In
         this connection it is desirable to invite to your attention two facts: <list>
          <label>a.</label>
          <item>There is in existence an Executive Order dated 3 July 1945,<note n="5"
            xml:id="d121fn5">Not found.</note> which created a National Cryptographic Security Board
           charged with responsibility for the efficient coordination and supervision of all
           cryptographic systems and related procedures of the Federal departments and agencies.
           This Board was established as a body apart from the then existing Communication
           Intelligence Board for the reason that different interests were involved.</item>
          <label>b.</label>
          <item>The United States Communication Intelligence Board (<gloss target="#t_USCIB1"
            >USCIB</gloss>) has considered at some length the advisability of extending its
           responsibilities to include communication security matters but has thus far failed to
           reach agreement.</item>
         </list></p>
        <p>In view of the foregoing facts, I believe that further study is required to determine the
         best national structure for communication security activities. Accordingly, the comments
         and proposed changes set forth herein have to do with <gloss target="#t_COMINT1"
          >COMINT</gloss> activities only. I will have a separate study made of the communication
         security problem with a view toward preparing a separate directive. It is believed
         advisable to treat the two categories separately, and this can be done without detriment to
         either. An attempt to combine the two in a single directive would probably introduce
         complications which could result in delaying implementation of the Committee’s clear-cut
         recommendations on <gloss target="#t_COMINT1">COMINT</gloss>.</p></item>
       <label>5.</label>
       <item>With respect to the latter recommendations, the following comment is submitted in
        response to paragraphs 3 and 4 of your memorandum: <list>
         <label>a.</label>
         <item><hi rend="italic">Recommendations as to Changes in Organization Above <gloss
            target="#t_AFSA1">AFSA</gloss></hi>
          <list>
           <label>(1)</label>
           <item>Retention in <gloss target="#t_USCIB1">USCIB</gloss> of the principle of decision
            and action on certain matters by unanimous agreement would serve to perpetuate one of
            the chief difficulties which according to the Committee now hamper <gloss
             target="#t_USCIB1">USCIB</gloss>, since the matters where this would apply are
            essentially those to which the Board has confined its attention in the past. This would
            particularly affect the protection of <gloss target="#t_COMINT1">COMINT</gloss> sources.
            The net result would be to preserve for each Department and Agency <pb n="296"
             xml:id="pg_296" facs="0325"/>virtual autonomy in the application of <gloss
             target="#t_COMINT1">COMINT</gloss> security measures, despite the fact that the
            maintenance of such security is vital to all. It is true that the right of appeal to
            higher authority is provided for in the proposed Board procedures. Nevertheless, this
            would place the burden of such appeal on the majority, where it would be reluctantly
            exercised, whereas in matters involving the common interest the burden of obtaining
            exception should rest on the minority. Extension of the majority-rule principle to all
            of the Board’s decisions and actions would not only accomplish the latter but would also
            simplify the Board’s procedures. Certainly it would appear desirable to extend this rule
            at least to security matters.</item>
           <label>(2)</label>
           <item>Paragraph d. (5) of the proposed Presidential Memorandum provides for certain
            special consideration in matters of appeal which involve the responsibilities of the
            Secretary of Defense as Executive Agent. These responsibilities pertain to those matters
            which fall within the jurisdiction of the Director of <gloss target="#t_AFSA1"
             >AFSA</gloss>. The propriety of according this consideration to appeals made by the
            representative of the Secretary of Defense is appreciated; nevertheless, since the
            Director of <gloss target="#t_AFSA1">AFSA</gloss> is also directly under the Secretary
            and is the individual immediately responsible, it would appear a less complicated
            arrangement to have the Director rather than the representative of the Secretary of
            Defense, given this special consideration in appeals. Accordingly, it is suggested that
            consideration be given to the advisability of this change.</item>
           <label>(3)</label>
           <item>Experience has demonstrated that the special nature of <gloss target="#t_COMINT1"
             >COMINT</gloss> activities requires that they be treated in all respects as being
            outside the framework of other or general intelligence activities. If this is not done
            the protection of <gloss target="#t_COMINT1">COMINT</gloss> sources is seriously
            jeopardized. In recognition of this fact, the current charter of <gloss
             target="#t_USCIB1">USCIB</gloss> (see paragraphs 6 and 8 of National Security Council
            Intelligence Directive #9)<note n="6" xml:id="d121fn6">See <ref

            certain provisions which I strongly urge be carried over into the new directive.</item>

           <item>The introductory statement to this section of the Committee’s conclusions and
            recommendations appears to imply that there are serious weaknesses in the present
            organizational structure of <gloss target="#t_AFSA1">AFSA</gloss>. I agree in general
            with what are apparently intended to be supporting comments of the Committee, but it
            strikes me that these comments are not, in fact, criticisms of structure but are remarks
            pertaining to personnel policies applicable to <gloss target="#t_AFSA1">AFSA</gloss>.
            They actually deal with incumbency of the Directorship and other key positions, the
            alleged high rate of turnover of personnel, and various other personnel problems. I
            assume therefore, that the Committee found no basic faults in the <gloss

           <item>With regard to the recommendation that the Director should have a civilian chief
            technical assistant who would have under him all research and development in the
            cryptanalytic field, it is to be noted that the Chief of the Office of Research and
            Development, one of the <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0326"/>three principal
            subdivisions of <gloss target="#t_AFSA1">AFSA</gloss>, has been a civilian since January
            1952. As a result of recommendations of the Special Cryptologic Advisory Group (SCAG) a
            plan for improving the organization of these activities is now in the process of
            development with the assistance of SCAG members.</item>
           <label>(3)</label>
           <item>It is noted that paragraph 2. a. of the Committee’s proposed Presidential
            Memorandum <hi rend="italic">excludes</hi> from the meaning of <gloss
             target="#t_COMINT1">COMINT</gloss> and the mission of <gloss target="#t_AFSA1"
             >AFSA</gloss> the evaluation and dissemination of information obtained from intercepted
            communications, and its synthesis with information from other sources. It is noted
            further that paragraph 2. c. (2) of the same memorandum states that the responsibility
            assigned to the Director of <gloss target="#t_AFSA1">AFSA</gloss>
            <hi rend="italic">does not contravene</hi> the responsibilities of the departments and
            agencies in respect to these same functions. Whereas the former statement is positively
            preclusive, the latter appears to afford the Director some freedom of action provided he
            does not interfere with the legitimate work of other agencies. Some latitude in this is
            essential for technical purposes, especially in the field of traffic analysis. It is,
            therefore, recommended that the former statement be omitted and the latter be retained,
            with a slight modification, as a separate and final provision of the proposed
            memorandum.</item>

            define more specifically the scope of the term for the purposes of the proposed
            directive. When read out of context, the definition of Communication Intelligence
            contained in the Law could be interpreted to include postal censorship and the
            monitoring and processing of foreign press and propaganda broadcasts. It is believed
            advisable to make it clear that such activities are not to be included under the
            provisions of the new directive.</item>

        suggested redraft of the proposed Presidential Memorandum for the Secretary of State and the

        with the directive to <gloss target="#t_USCIB1">USCIB</gloss>. This rearrangement is
        considered advisable because of the recommended change in Board procedure. I consider that

       <item><hi rend="italic">Background</hi>. At the request of Mr. <persName>Palmer
         Putnam</persName> (<gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss>), and of Admiral <persName>Luis
         deFlorez</persName> (OTS/<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>), I called <persName>Dean E.
         C. Watson</persName>, California Institute of Technology (Cal Tech) on 10 July 1952 and
        asked if he could arrange for himself, President <persName>DuBridge</persName> and
        Professors <persName>Lauritsen</persName>, <persName>Bacher</persName> and
         <persName>Millikan</persName> to meet with us in Pasadena on Thursday, July 17th for the
        purpose of discussing this subject. <persName>Dean Watson</persName> said that he would be
        delighted to arrange the discussion. Upon arrival we found that Professor
         <persName>Millikan</persName> had been called out of town and could not meet with us.
         <persName>Dean Watson</persName> said that Professor <persName>J. L. Greenstein</persName>,
        an astrophysicist, had conducted some discussion with the Rand Corporation people regarding
        the vehicle and suggested that <persName>Greenstein</persName>’s knowledge would be helpful
        if we were agreeable to inviting him into the discussion. We thereupon asked Professor
         <persName>Greenstein</persName> to consult with us.</item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item><persName>Putnam</persName> had brought with him several copies of a paper which he had
        prepared outlining current capabilities of the Soviets and indicating that by 1957 the
        Soviets will possess the capability of a saturation attack with atomic weapons against the
        United States and against which the United States can have no effective defense.
         <persName>Putnam</persName> held <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0328"/>that some drastic
        policies are required and that we need to increase our intelligence take regarding the
        Soviet Union. He suggested that the utilization of a satellite vehicle for reconnaissance
        purposes might be one means of increasing our intelligence concerning the Soviet Union and
        of physical structures and the characteristics relating thereto.</item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>We made reference to the Rand Corporation report “Utility of a Satellite Vehicle for
        Reconnaissance,” <gloss target="#t_R1">R</gloss>–217. The scientists present from Cal Tech
        had read the report.</item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item>The report contemplated and discussed the feasibility of building and launching a
        so-called satellite vehicle which would orbit around the earth at an altitude of some 350
        miles above the earth travelling at a speed of five miles per second, thus completing from
        14 to 18 complete orbits every 24 hours earth time. The satellite would be powered by an
        isotope of cerium (<gloss target="#t_CE1">Ce</gloss>–144), a beta emitter, which would heat
        mercury into a vapor which in turn would drive an engine which would drive generators for
        production of power. The power would be utilized, once the satellite was on orbit, for
        operating the navigational controls and a television camera and transmitter which would be
        incorporated in the satellite. The orbit of the vehicle would be predetermined with respect
        to the earth’s latitude and longitude thereby permitting intensive coverage from the
        standpoint of photography of certain portions of the earth. The Rand study contemplated that
        five television receiving stations would be erected on the earth to receive the television
        signals and transmissions from the vehicle. The vehicle would not be man-carrying.</item>
       <label>5.</label>
       <item>It was the general consensus of the Cal Tech scientists: <list>
         <label>a.</label>
         <item>That it was probably feasible to build such a vehicle;</item>
         <label>b.</label>
         <item>That there would be unforeseen difficulties, which probably could be surmounted, in
          “marrying” the different technical systems to be contained within the satellite;</item>
         <label>c.</label>
         <item>That the problem of insuring sufficient reliability of electronic equipment installed
          in the satellite when such equipment could not be got at or serviced would be
          great;</item>
         <label>d.</label>
         <item>Serious question was raised as to the value of pictures taken from an altitude of 350
          miles. <list>
           <label>(1)</label>
           <item>Resolution of presently available television camera equipment was recognized to be
            of not much significance for objects of less than 200′ × 200′ in size. Question was
            therefore raised as to the net addition to be made by such photographs to our
            intelligence knowledge concerning Soviet territory.</item>
           <label>(2)</label>
           <item>Question was raised as to whether the gross information thus obtainable would be
            worth the cost and the time interval which necessarily must take place before such a
            vehicle could be developed and successfully operated.</item>
          </list></item>
         <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0329"/>
         <label>e.</label>
         <item>Factors relating to the pitch, roll and yaw characteristics of the vehicle were
          discussed. It was considered that very slight pitches and rolls might seriously interfere
          with picture collection and might make difficult the identification of areas of which
          pictures were taken;</item>
         <label>f.</label>
         <item>Inasmuch as almost no facts are available concerning temperatures at altitudes above
          100 miles from the earth’s surface, it was considered that heating and cooling aspects of
          the satellite vehicle would be subject to considerable speculation and
          experimentation;</item>
         <label>g.</label>
         <item>Normal atmospheric turbulence was considered to be a factor which might interfere
          with picture taking;</item>
         <label>h.</label>
         <item>It was considered that four or five such satellites might have to be built and
          launched before one could be launched that would stay on orbit and operate as we
          required.</item>
        </list></item>
       <label>6.</label>
       <item>Professor <persName>Lauritsen</persName> appeared to be the least impressed by the
        possibility of use of a satellite vehicle for such reconnaissance purposes. He asserted that
        in his opinion it would require from eight to ten years to develop and construct such a
        vehicle for launching. He considered also that the same or better reconnaissance information
        could be secured by the employment of from six to twelve jet aircraft flying at an altitude
        of 50,000 feet over the Soviet Union. He further asserted that such aircraft in one day
        could secure the photographic information of better resolution and quality than could the
        satellite vehicle camera. <persName>Lauritsen</persName> asserted that this could be done
        immediately with presently available equipment and that such aircraft could not be picked up
        by radar.</item>
       <label>7.</label>
       <item>At the conclusion of our discussion I posed substantially the following question to the
        scientists present: “If you were at present the Director of Central Intelligence what would
        be your attitude and action regarding the satellite vehicle for reconnaissance purposes?”
        President <persName>DuBridge</persName> and <persName>Dean Watson</persName> responded
        substantially as follows: <list>
         <label>a.</label>
         <item>They would continue to consider the possibility of utilization of such a satellite
          vehicle and in so doing they would <list>
           <label>(1)</label>
           <item>consult with the scientists at the Rand Corporation who have studied the matter
            intensively and have prepared the reports;</item>
          </list></item>
         <label>b.</label>
         <item>They would insure that additional and continuing feasibility studies regarding the
          development and construction of such a vehicle were pursued;</item>
         <label>c.</label>
         <item>They would seriously investigate the nature and quality of pictures (information)
          that could be secured from operation of such a vehicle;</item>
         <label>d.</label>
         <item>They would consider whether the additional intelligence information that
          theoretically could be secured from such a vehicle would be worth the possible cost and
          the time lag necessary to create and produce it;</item>
         <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301" facs="0330"/>
         <label>e.</label>
         <item>They would consider whether alternative means for securing the information might not
          be more effective. Among such alternative means they mentioned clandestine operations and
          aerial photography from aircraft or balloons;</item>
         <label>f.</label>
         <item>They suggested that aerial photographic analysis people of the Air Force be consulted
          as to their ability to interpret photographs of the approximate resolution to be expected
          from the satellite vehicle.</item>
        </list></item>
       <label>8.</label>
       <item>At the conclusion of our discussion at Cal Tech, President
         <persName>DuBridge</persName> arranged for Messrs. <persName>Gibbons</persName> and
         <persName>Putnam</persName> to go to Santa Monica to discuss the matter further with the
        Rand Corporation people. I did not accompany them for this discussion.</item>

      <p>1. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 59/1 was approved as governmental policy on March
       10, 1950. It is requested that this progress report covering the period April 15–July 31,
       1952, of activities untaken in implementation of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 59/1 be
       circulated to the members of the Council for their information. In accordance with the
       provisions of the third paragraph of the President’s directive of April 4, 1951,<note n="3"
        xml:id="d124fn3">See <ref target="#d60">Document 60</ref>.</note> a copy of this report is
       being referred to the Psychological Strategy Board for use in its evaluation of the national
       psychological effort.</p>
      <p>2. The organization referred to in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 59/1 has been
       designated The Psychological Operations Coordinating Committee (POC).<note n="4"
        xml:id="d124fn4">See <ref target="#d74">Document 74</ref>.</note> It will be referred to in
       this report as “the Committee.”</p>
      <p>3. This report describes only those foreign information operations and plans which, being
       interdepartmental in nature, were coordinated through the Committee.</p>
      <p>4. Under the Chairmanship of the Administrator, the International Information
       Administration, the following are regularly represented at the weekly meetings of the
       Committee: Secretary of Defense, the Defense Department Office of Information, Joint Chiefs
       of Staff, the Mutual Security Agency, Central Intelligence Agency, Assistant Secretary for
       Public Affairs, Department of State, the Army, Navy and Air Force chiefs of psychological
       warfare and the Psychological Strategy Board staff. In accordance with the terms of the
       President’s directive of April 4, 1951, which among other things authorized the Secretary of
       State to effect readjustments in the organization established under <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
        >NSC</gloss> 59/1, the POC secretariat was transformed into a full time interdepartmental
       planning staff.</p>
      <p>5. During the period covered by this report the Committee concentrated its attention on
       psychological problems connected with the <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303" facs="0332"/>Korean
       situation, particularly with respect to the prisoner of war issue, both as regards the
       physical control of prisoners of the United Nations Command and also as regards the prisoner
       issue in the truce negotiations. The recommendations of the Committee were designed to
       contribute to the ability of the UN Command to gain and maintain the psychological initiative
       in Korea. However, our psychological efforts in Korea were directed toward the achievement of
       the principal UN aim in Korea—the conclusion of an armistice.</p>
      <p>6. Ascertaining that the United Nations Command was in a position of serious disadvantage
       in handling the problems described above, the Committee took prompt action resulting in the
       following: <list>
        <label>a.</label>
        <item>An on-the-scene survey of psychological warfare support arrangements in Japan and
         Korea by a team comprised of the Administrator, the International Information
         Administration, Dept. of State; the Chief of Psychological Warfare, Department of the Army;
         and the Policy Advisor, International Broadcasting Service, Department of State.</item>
        <label>b.</label>
        <item>The establishment in Washington on June 12 of a watch committee, with representation
         from the Departments of Defense and State and the Central Intelligence Agency, whose
         purpose is to supply a daily summary of news, editorials and public comments originating in
         the U.S. and foreign countries, both Communist and non-Communist, concerning the Korean
         situation, and to provide suggestions, information and advice on psychological matters for
         fast transmission to Tokyo, Pusan and Panmunjom.</item>
        <label>c.</label>
        <item>The establishment of a corresponding unit within FECOM comprised of military,
         psychological warfare and public information experts whose function is to inform FECOM of
         current world wide public reaction to developments in Korea, and to provide, in quantity,
         material and suggestions which may be useful in advancing the UNC propaganda position
         relative to Korea.</item>
        <label>d.</label>
        <item>The preparation of an action plan to provide for such activities as the following: <list>

      <p>The Committee gave considerable attention to Communist charges concerning bacteriological
       warfare in Korea. The Committee audited the activities of a working group comprised of
       representatives of the <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0333"/>Departments of Defense and
       State and the Central Intelligence Agency, under State leadership for the purpose of
       developing psychological plans for: (1) countering the Communist charges, and (2) developing
       when possible new measures which would be designed to seize and maintain the propaganda
       initiative. The group is effectively coordinating the efforts of the agencies concerned with
       handling the problem.</p>
      <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Troop Acceptance in Japan</hi></p>
      <p>The Committee provided interdepartmental coordination of a plan for developing an attitude
       of acceptance and an active sense of responsibility on the part of the Japanese Government
       and people with regard to the mission of the United States armed forces stationed in and
       about Japan as a consequence of the United States–Japan Security Treaty.</p>
      <p>9. <hi rend="italic">X-Day Planning</hi></p>
      <p>The Committee has continued to monitor the planning of its X-Day Working Group, which is
       preparing complete contingency plans for overt psychological operations during the initial
       stages of general hostilities. When completed and approved by the Committee the plans will be
       forwarded to the Psychological Strategy Board.</p>
      <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Yugoslav Plan</hi></p>
      <p>The Committee noted and referred to the staff of the Psychological Strategy Board for
       further development a working paper on maintenance of Yugoslav independence from Soviet
       domination.</p>
      <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Review of POC Business</hi></p>
      <p>The committee has undertaken an extensive review of unfinished POC business and is

       recommendations and is monitoring the implementation of approved projects.</p>
      <p>12. <hi rend="italic">POC Recommendation Regarding Communist Military Buildup in
       Korea</hi></p>
      <p>The POC recommended that there be a full public exposition of the facts on the nature and
       extent of the Communist military buildup in Korea during the course of the truce
       negotiations. As a result of POC’s recommendation appropriate statements were issued by the
       UN Command, by the British and by other governments having forces in Korea.</p>

      <p rend="center">STATUS REPORT ON THE NATIONAL PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFORT AND FIRST PROGRESS REPORT
       OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL STRATEGY BOARD</p>
      <p>[Omitted here are a list of references and a brief summary of the report.]</p>
      <p rend="center">I. Status of the National Psychological Effort</p>
      <p>The Board presents below a statement on the status of national psychological programs as of
       30 June 1952. In submitting this statement the Board desires to emphasize the following
       general conclusions: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>To be fully effective, psychological planning at the strategic level should ideally be
         based on an agreed overall strategic concept for our national psychological programs. While
         efforts to date underline the difficulties of formulating such a concept, some progress has
         been made in achieving agreement on certain broad criteria to be utilized in establishing
         relative priorities within existing capabilities. Further progress toward the development
         and implementation of an agreed strategic concept for our psychological effort can take
         place only in conjunction with a corresponding development of capabilities and resources
         and an accompanying adjustment of basic national policy.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>The United States is not making significant progress in the psychological field toward
         its objective of reduction and retraction of Soviet power as laid down in <gloss
          target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 20/4.<note n="2" xml:id="d125fn2">See <ref
           target="frus1948v01p2#pg_662"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1948, vol. I,
           Part 2, pp. 662</ref>–<ref target="frus1948v01p2#pg_669">669</ref>.</note> In considering
         the total cold war position of the United States as contrasted with that position a year
         ago, it is evident that in certain areas, such as Western Europe, our position has been
         strengthened by the good progress recorded under <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.
         However, there has been some deterioration of strength in certain other areas, notably in
         the Near East. But this should not necessarily be attributed to superior effectiveness of
         Soviet propaganda.</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>A major handicap in psychological operations outside of the Iron Curtain derives from
         growing resentment in parts of Asia and throughout much of Europe to a “made in America”
         label on part of our psychological output. Of even graver significance is the increasing
          <pb n="306" xml:id="pg_306" facs="0335"/>reaction against the military character of some
         of our political and economic activity. Programs designed to have a deterrent effect on the
         Soviet Union are distorted and exploited by communist or anti-American propaganda and thus
         are occasioning resistance, neutralism, and charges of agressiveness to the detriment of
         our psychological effort.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>The statement which follows is based on an analysis of current reports of the Department of
       State and the Department of Defense, of a report by field staff representatives of the Mutual
       Security Agency, and of a report by the Central Intelligence Agency, concerning their
       activities related to the national psychological effort during the fiscal year ending 30 June
        1952.<note n="3" xml:id="d125fn3">For the text of the report of the Department of State to
        the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>, and summaries of the other three reports mentioned,
        see Annexes A, B, and C, and specially classified Annex D. [Footnote in the original.
        Regarding these annexes, see <ref target="#d125fn1">footnote 1</ref> above.]</note></p>
      <p>This statement is not presented as a full evaluation of the national psychological program
       during the period in question, the Board having decided that such an evaluation is not
       possible at this time. However, the reports on which it is based throw significant light on
       some aspects of the existing “cold war” situation. There emerges from them a picture of some
       substantial progress, mixed with many problems and obstacles which hinder a more complete
       achievement of our psychological objectives.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">A. Outside the Iron Curtain</hi></p>
      <p>The general psychological situation in the non-Soviet world is not bright, but progress has
       been made in some areas.</p>
      <p>In <hi rend="italic">Western Europe</hi> the picture is spotty. On the one hand, progress
       is reported in containing Soviet communism and in the development of unity and readiness to
       build indigenous military strength in the area. On the other hand there are disturbing
       reports of the growth of neutralism and anti-Americanism in France and Britain, if not in
       Western Europe as a whole.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">In the Middle East</hi>, irresponsible nationalism is the current major
       threat to free world interests. United States capabilities for effective psychological action
       have declined though some slow progress is reported in certain sections of the Moslem
       world.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">In Africa</hi>, intensive communist efforts to gain control over the
       colored races are having some success. A modest start has been made at laying the groundwork
       for future activities aimed at checking them.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">In Latin America</hi>, there has been a recent increase in our
       capabilities for effective psychological action, and some indication of substantial progress
       in combatting anti-American feeling in certain countries.</p>
      <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307" facs="0336"/>
      <p><hi rend="italic">In South and Southeast Asia</hi>, anti-colonialism and associated racial
       resentments have been far more important elements in the psychological developments in the
       military struggle against rebel forces in the area. On the other hand, communist electoral
       gains in India have forced the Nehru Government to modify perceptibly its former position of
       neutrality in the East-West conflict.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">In Formosa and Japan</hi>, some gains are reported as a result of United
       States psychological activities.</p>
      <p>In addition to the above comments on specific areas, the following general observations on
       the non-Soviet world, drawn from the departmental reports, may be warranted.</p>
      <list>
       <label>1.</label>
       <item>A steady operational trend toward the use of indigenous groups for propaganda purposes
        reflects a recognition that in many areas overt propaganda bearing the United States label
        is meeting with increasing indifference or resistance. Further development of non-attributed
        psychological methods, together with a de-emphasis of overt channels, appears to be logical
        in this situation.</item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>In underdeveloped countries some progress has been made in developing psychological
        approaches which appeal to local aspirations and emphasize local participation and
        initiative. Such approaches are particularly relevant in these areas, where the memory or
        actuality of domination by the white man is a far greater psychological reality than the
        Soviet menace.</item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>The overriding abhorrence of another possible war in some areas, particularly Western
        Europe, constitutes an important psychological liability for the United States. This
        attitude tends to inhibit actions which may seem to involve any increased risk of war, and
        manifests itself in neutralism, anti-Americanism, and extreme sensitivity to occasional
        warlike statements by leading Americans. The spread of this attitude makes possible the
        continued effective use of “peace” as a leading theme in Soviet psychological
        aggression.</item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item>Certain national policies of the United States are psychologically damaging in various
        areas of the non-Soviet world. In the Moslem world this is true of United States policy
        toward Israel; in areas under European domination it is true of United States identification
        with its <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies which makes it difficult for the
        United States to avoid the psychological effects of the colonial policies of those allies;
        in Britain and elsewhere it is true of United States policy toward China.</item>
      </list>
      <p>The same may be said of certain primarily domestic matters. For instance, efforts to
       counteract communist exploitation of the race relations problem in the United States have not
       been fully successful. Likewise, the restrictive immigration policy of the United States,
       most recently embodied in the <persName>McCarran</persName> Act, has damaging psychological
       repercussions abroad. Finally, United States tariff laws severely hurt the <pb n="308"
        xml:id="pg_308" facs="0337"/>ability of foreign countries to export to this country and thus
       are seen abroad as running directly counter to United States policy of building up economic
       stability in the free world by expanding international trade.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">B. Behind the Iron Curtain</hi></p>
      <p>The Soviet grip in the Communist-dominated areas of Europe and of the Far East appeared to
       be even firmer at the end of the fiscal year 1952 than at the beginning. There was no
       evidence of progress toward achievement of the basic objectives set forth in <gloss
        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 20/4, namely, the reduction and retraction of Soviet communist
       power. Moreover, short-term possibilities of any improvement in this respect appeared so
       slight as to be negligible. In this area of the world our national psychological effort, both
       overt and covert, must continue for some time to emphasize long-term objectives and the
       discovery of means to build up resources and capabilities.</p>
      <p>Among the many problems incident to this buildup, one in particular may be mentioned. Our
       capabilities for effective action against the communist regime in China are limited in part
       by the absence of a stable and more universal rallying point outside China to which overseas
       Chinese could look for political and psychological leadership, and by the related need for a
       thorough-going reform of Nationalist Chinese military and political institutions.</p>
      <p>In the overt information field behind the Iron Curtain, the Voice of America and Radio Free
       Europe clearly emerge from the reports as the only significant remaining programs which
       effectively reach the people of either or both the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
       the Satellites. The reports are equally clear, however, as to the need for making the Voice
       still more powerful. Meanwhile there are ominous indications that we may be falling behind in
       the electromagnetic war.</p>
      <p>Some good use has been made of defectors and escapees from behind the Iron Curtain during
       the year, both on the programs of the Voice and America and in non-attributable activities of
       other agencies. Results point to the desirability of a still more highly organized effort in
       this direction.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">C. Related Activities</hi></p>
      <p>Certain related activities of a highly restricted nature are not covered in the body of
       this report. For an evaluative summary of these activities, reference is made to the
       specially classified Annex D.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">D. Organizational Progress</hi></p>
      <p>An improvement is noted in the effectiveness of policy guidance during the period covered
       by this report. In part, the improvement has resulted from closer cooperation of the
       departments and agencies involved. Quicker and more effective action both in Washington and
       in <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0338"/>the field, and a consequent improvement in the
       coordination of our psychological effort, has resulted from a number of forward steps in
       organization. The reports make it clear, however, that much still remains to be done.</p>
      <p rend="center">II. Progress in Formulating and Promulgating Over-All National Psychological
       Objectives, Policies and Programs</p>
      <p>During its first year of operation the Psychological Strategy Board has taken a number of
       steps to carry out its responsibility “for the formulation and promulgation, as guidance to
       the departments and agencies responsible for psychological operations, of over-all national
       psychological objectives, policies and programs, and for the coordination and evaluation of
       the national psychological effort.” The major effort has been in the planning field. The
       chief steps taken are as follows:<note n="4" xml:id="d125fn4">For a more detailed report on

        most important actions lies with the indigenous governments. Supporting actions by the

       <p rend="center">SUMMARY OF A REPORT FROM THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY</p>
       <p>There has been some progress in achieving the national objectives set forth in <gloss
         target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2 and 10/5.<note n="6" xml:id="d127fn6">For <gloss

          target="#d90">Document 90</ref>.</note> This progress, however, has been slow and in most
        areas severely restricted, partly by the limited nature of available resources and
        capabilities, but even more by time limitations. It takes a long time to develop the
        apparatus and the trained personnel for covert activities and the development of concepts
        and doctrine of the kind discussed in this report. The United States has been engaged in
        covert activities for too brief a period, and therefore present developments fall far short
        of ultimate potential.</p>
       <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Europe</hi></p>
       <p>In France and Italy, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> reports that Soviet power and
        influence apparently are being contained. Increased and more effective covert psychological
        operations in Western Europe may account for the increasingly violent and indiscriminate
        nature of the Soviet and indigenous Communist propaganda barrage against the anti-Communist
        organizations in that area.</p>
       <p>[<hi rend="italic">2 paragraphs (22 lines) not declassified</hi>]</p>
       <p>In Eastern Europe, Soviet power and influence have not been reduced to any measurable
        extent. However, U.S. capabilities for future covert operations have increased, [<hi
         rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]. Recent covert operations have
        revealed that the Communist authorities do not have complete control of the situation in
        these countries, and that the area can be successfully penetrated. Thanks to much valuable
        experience gained in the techniques of covert psychological warfare and political action in
        Eastern Europe, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> now possesses capabilities for
        influencing large segments of labor, youth, refugees, persecutees, women, religious groups,
        and political parties.</p>
       <pb n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0345"/>
       <p>In the satellite countries of Southeastern Europe, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
        capabilities for psychological operations have increased considerably, though Soviet power
        and influence have not been reduced in the area.</p>
       <p>The power and influence of the <persName>Kremlin</persName> within the <gloss
         target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has not been affected by U.S. covert activities, and
        short-term possibilities in this direction are so slight as to be insignificant. <gloss
         target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>’s effort in this area is now being focused on progressively
        developing capabilities for long-term exploitation.</p>
       <p>Pointing out that present policy provides for U.S. support of anti-regime resistance of
        the Great Russians, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> sees a definite need for resolving
        the policy question of the extent to which it will be permitted to support clandestinely and
        exploit operationally <hi rend="italic">any</hi> group or individual actively interested in
        the destruction of the Bolshevik regime.</p>
       <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Middle East</hi></p>
       <p>A decline in U.S. capabilities throughout most of the Middle East is noted, though this is
        felt to be only temporary. To some extent, the decrease in U.S. covert capabilities in the
        Middle East is attributed to the policy conflict arising out of U.S. support for the
        maintenance of France’s position in North Africa, which has psychological repercussions
        throughout the African, Arab, and Asian worlds. Similarly, an impediment to U.S.
        capabilities in the area is found in the disparity of our attitudes toward Israel and the
        Arab States despite a stated policy of impartiality.</p>
       <p>In the particularly important field of the Moslem world, some progress has been achieved
        along the following lines: <list>
         <label>1.</label>
         <item>In utilizing nationalist forces for our own purposes, by endeavoring to direct them
          away from their more destructive tendencies and into channels which will be relatively
          compatible with U.S. interests; namely, to endeavor to turn the force of nationalism
          against the Communists, to direct it against political corruption, to focus it upon
          demands for social reform and economic progress;</item>
         <label>2.</label>
         <item>In stimulating an increased awareness among the religious hierarchy of the threat of
          international Communism;</item>
         <label>3.</label>
         <item>In increasing the degree of understanding of the status of Moslems living inside the
          Soviet orbit; and</item>
         <label>4.</label>
         <item>In laying the groundwork for further expanded activities along similar lines.
          Progress will continue to be slow in this field because of the most delicate and dangerous
          aspect of Near Eastern affairs from the point of view of foreign intervention.</item>
        </list></p>
       <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Far East</hi></p>
       <p>Support of the Chinese Nationalist Government on Formosa is described as the most
        significant program now being undertaken by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> in the Far
        East, where the Agency is also actively supporting the military <pb n="317" xml:id="pg_317"
         facs="0346"/>authorities in Korea and laying the groundwork for penetration of Manchuria
        and North China.</p>
       <p>While, on balance, the U.S. has achieved some psychological gains in the overt field
        (Treaty of Peace with Japan, Pacific Military Alliances, etc.), Soviet power has not been
        measurably reduced in the Far Eastern areas under its dominance, and progress toward our
        objectives in the field of covert activities has been negligible, [<hi rend="italic">less
         than 1 line not declassified</hi>]. There, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>’s activities
        directed toward discrediting Soviet Russia, Communist China, the [<hi rend="italic">less
         than 1 line not declassified</hi>], and Communism in general, are having some success.</p>
       <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Korea</hi></p>
       <p><gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> regards coordinating machinery between civilian and
        military authorities in the field of psychological warfare as inadequate in certain
        respects. A coordinating mechanism (CCRAK) was set up, for example, but failed to include
        the operations of <gloss target="#t_USIE1">USIE</gloss> services in Korea. Close cooperation
        with the military exists in the field on intelligence and tactical psychological warfare
        measures. However, a completely effective coordination of two major strategic plans with
        respect to Korea has not been realized with respect to coordination of command and
        logistical support, but steps are being taken to remedy this situation. These are expected
        to result in some modifications of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>’s responsibilities to
        ensure that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> does not commit itself to actions which are
        beyond its present or anticipated capabilities.</p>
       <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Latin America</hi></p>
       <p>Despite evidence that the Soviet Union is now placing greater emphasis on its covert
        mechanisms in Latin America, U.S. covert capabilities there have substantially increased
        during the past year through the expansion of personnel and facilities. Such expansion, it
        is planned, may increasingly turn toward the formation or support of indigenous,
        nationalistic, free-enterprise groups or political parties. Some substantial results in
        combating pro-Communist and anti-American influences have been achieved through covert means
         [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]. It is to be noted that Latin
        America is an area unique for the United States, because of the overt Good Neighbor and
        non-intervention policies of long standing, and the powerful reasons necessitating those
        overt policies. The security of covert operations and the further development of policy and
        management systems which protect such security both in Washington and in the field are of
        peculiar importance for this area. Therefore, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
        capabilities have been developed to be operative only under special conditions.</p>
       <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Africa</hi></p>
       <p>In Africa a beginning has been made in laying the groundwork for future activities to
        check Communist efforts to get control over the <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0347"
        />colored races; but this work has so far been purely preparatory and no progress toward
        actual achievement in that field is recorded.</p>
       <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">General</hi></p>
       <p>In general, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> emphasizes the importance of setting up
        increased capabilities, particularly in the form of thoroughly-trained American and
        indigenous personnel and long-term cover mechanisms. An apparent need exists for
        establishing at all possible points radio broadcast facilities capable of reaching the
         <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
       <p><gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>’s capabilities need to be reinforced for building up
        an apparatus capable of long-term exploitation against the Chinese Communist regime. For the
        shorter terms <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has had only very limited success in the
        penetration either of Communist China or the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
        itself.</p>
       <p><gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> points up the vital importance of <gloss
         target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> as constituting at present the only effective means the U.S.
        possesses for conducting psychological operations within the confines of the <gloss
         target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Covert penetration has been carried out primarily for the
        purpose of procuring intelligence, and because of the rigid controls impeding the movement
        of agents inside that country, no psychological warfare under present conditions can be
        undertaken in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> by any other medium except
        radio.</p>
       <p>Through its covert channels <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has discovered that <gloss
         target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> broadcasts have been audible in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
         >USSR</gloss> throughout 1950 and 1951. Although Soviet jamming has considerably reduced
        the audibility of these broadcasts, nevertheless information [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines not
         declassified</hi>] indicates that considerable segments of the Soviet peoples continue to
        listen to <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> broadcasts despite technical difficulties and
        personal risk. Some of these refugees have criticised the <gloss target="#t_VOA1"
         >VOA</gloss> broadcasts for not being sufficiently forceful and for devoting a considerable
        portion of the programs to irrelevant matters not bearing directly on the current East-West
        struggle. Furthermore, ethnic groups such as the Ukrainians have complained that the
        broadcasts are not sufficiently representative of the desires and aspirations of the
        minority groups within the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. But when all this is said,
        the fact remains that information obtained by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> indicates
        that the <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> broadcasts do play an important role in
        reminding the peoples of the Soviet Union that there is an alternative way of life, and in
        providing them with hope of ultimate liberation.</p>
       <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (5 lines) not declassified</hi>]</p>
       <p>In Western Europe especially, there was marked progress in <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
         >CIA</gloss>’s efforts to work through various anti-Communist groups—both urban and rural.
        At the same time, there have as yet been no very tangible results from attempts to penetrate
        indigenous Communist parties. On the other hand, efforts to combat Communist influence in
        the labor unions, [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>] have met with
        considerable success, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>], <pb

        1952</p>
       <p rend="center">1. Plans Completed and Being Executed</p>
       <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">A. Psychological Operations Plan for the Reduction of
         Communist Power in France. (<gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> D–14/c)</hi>.</p>
       <p>This plan and the corresponding one for Italy (Paragraph 1B) were developed by the same
         <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> planning panel and actions under both plans are being
        coordinated by the same group. Both plans resulted from extensive inquiry during the summer
        and fall of 1951, as a result of which the Board concluded that the French and Italian
        Communist apparati, the two most powerful in Western Europe, constituted a serious threat to
        American foreign policy and to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> plans for defense of
        Western Europe. In consequence, the Board prescribed specific courses of action for
        reduction of Communist power in both France and Italy.</p>
       <p>Upon approval of both plans on February 21, 1952, a Washington interdepartmental
        coordinating committee was established under the chairmanship of a member of the <gloss
         target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> staff, and comparable panels were established in Paris and
        Rome. These groups are in communication with each other with respect to implementation of
        the plans.</p>
       <p>Analysis of the Communist position in both France and Italy resulted in the conclusion
        that in both countries the primary sources of Communist power was in their organized control
        over trade unions. Therefore, the main emphasis in both plans is devoted to reduction of
        Communist power over trade unions and the encouragement of the free trade union movement.
        The most important actions that can be taken in both countries are for the government to
        give positive support to the democratic unions in their struggle against Communist <pb
         n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0349"/>domination of organized labor, to stop subsidizing and
        to stop dealing with the Communist unions, and to work towards a more equitable share of the
        national income for labor.</p>
       <p>With regard to the French plan, progress toward achieving the major objectives appears
        hopeful under the present Pinay Government. Unlike its predecessors, the Pinay Government
        has demonstrated far more courage and affirmative leadership, and on its own initiative, has
        been moving vigorously against the Communists within the last two months. However, this is
        no guarantee of stability. The government has given us assurances that it will continue this
        campaign and that it intends to take specific action to reduce Communist power in the trade
        union field. While making known to the government our continuing interest in this problem,
        we have withheld more affirmative participation and are watching the French initiative with
        hope in its promise for the future.</p>
       <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">B. Psychological Operations Plan for the Reduction of
         Communist Power in Italy. (<gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> D–15/b)</hi>.</p>
       <p>As stated in connection with the similar plan for reduction of Communist power in France
        reported in the previous paragraph, this plan was approved by the Board on February 21,
        1952. Development of the plan, which was in conjunction with the development of the French
        plan, is reported on in the previous paragraph.</p>
       <p>With regard to progress concerning the achievement of the objectives of the Italian plan,
        since September 1951 we have made high level representations expressing our concern over the
        continued strength of Communist power in Italy. The DeGasperi Government has repeatedly
        assured us that it intends to take vigorous measures to reduce the strength and influence of
        the Communist movement. Up to the May 1952 elections, the government had done very little
        along these lines and, particularly, had not moved against the main sources of Communist
        power in the trade union field.</p>
       <p>The local elections throughout Italy in 1951 and 1952 indicated no diminution and perhaps
        a slight increase of electoral support for the Communist-left socialist bloc. Since the 1948
        national elections, when this bloc polled 31.4%, it has for the first time made substantial
        inroads into the agricultural South. In contrast to this, the electoral support for the four
        democratic center parties was substantially reduced compared to 1948 due to a sharp fall off
        in support for the Christian-Democrat Party, while the extreme right received a sharp
        increase in support.</p>
       <p>Since the May elections we have received renewed and more positive assurances that the
        government means to move against the Communists and there have been indications of formal
        action. The government will put its main reliance on new legislation. The situation <pb
         n="321" xml:id="pg_321" facs="0350"/>now appears more promising and hopeful than it has
        been for a long time, but we are awaiting positive results. Since the Communists appear to
        be avoiding the provocation of the Italian Government, we are hopeful that the latter will
        take positive action on its own initiative.</p>

         Escapees—Phase “A” (<gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> D–18a)</hi>.</p>
       <p>This plan, approved by <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> December 20, 1951, includes
        programs to care for and resettle current escapees, and envisages maximum possible
        utilization of escapees [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] under
        Public Law 51 (<persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> Amendment), which permits
        recruitment of escapees into the U.S. Armed Forces. (For discussion of Phase “B” see
        paragraph 3A below.)</p>
       <p>On April 7, pursuant to approval by the President, $4.3 million dollars were made
        available by the Director of Mutual Security to the Department of State, which had been
        given responsibility for the program.</p>
       <p>The time since funds were made available has been used to build the organization and staff
        for the continuing administration of the program; and to identify and care for the most
        urgent immediate needs of escapees.</p>
       <p><hi rend="italic">Organization</hi>. Small staffs are being established and activities
        have begun in each of the countries which border the iron curtain. A regional office in
         <gloss target="#t_HICOG1">HICOG</gloss> and a policy and coordination unit in the
        Department of State have been established.</p>
       <p><hi rend="italic">Resettlement and Supplemental Care.</hi> A general contract was signed
        on June 16, 1952, with the Provisional Committee for the Movement of Migrants from Europe
        (PICMME, an international body organized in November, 1951) for the overseas transport of up
        to 14,000 escapees during one year at an estimated rate of $100 per capita. The number thus
        far moved under the program is negligible, but it is anticipated that a scheduled flow may
        be attained in August.</p>
       <p>Projects have been authorized to care for urgent immediate needs of escapees resident in
        Greece, Germany, Austria, Turkey and Italy, needs such as food, clothing, shoes, repair and
        decontamination of barracks, and medical treatment. In every country of operation the
        immediate needs of the escapees are being met.</p>
       <p><hi rend="italic">Propaganda Utilization.</hi> No general propaganda utilization of the
        plans and activities of the escapee program is now contemplated by State Department.
        Newsworthy projects and assistance to key individuals will be used in media reaching iron
        curtain areas when appropriate. When the program has greater accomplishments to point to,
        the State Department plans more general treatment. Similar policies govern domestic
        information activity.</p>
       <pb n="322" xml:id="pg_322" facs="0351"/>
       <p><hi rend="italic">Funds.</hi> Of the initial authorization of $4,300,000, an estimated
        $1,500,000 was obligated during the fiscal year 1952. An additional $1,460,500 is being
        requested to cover an increase in the estimated number of escapees already requiring
        assistance.</p>
       <p><hi rend="italic">Accomplishment of Other Purposes.</hi> As requested under this phase of
        the plan, the Department of Defense has somewhat liberalized the conditions under which
        escapees may be recruited under the authorization of the <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
         >Lodge</persName> Amendment. Of 5194 applications, 3916 have been rejected, 295 have been
        accepted (262 on active duty), and 982 are being processed.</p>

       <p>This plan was approved by the Psychological Strategy Board on October 25, 1951. It is
        designed to establish special psychological objectives to be implemented toward our allies
        as well as our adversaries, with respect to the Korean conflict. Some of the desired courses
        of action are at present in effect, but the majority of the recommended actions are directly
        related to the progress made in connection with the cease-fire. The operational planning is

       <p rend="center">5. ESPIONAGE AND COUNTERESPIONAGE</p>
       <p>U.S. espionage and counterespionage activities outside the Continental limits of the U.S.,
        with certain exceptions, are conducted by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. Through these
        activities, including the operation of secret agents, [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines not
         declassified</hi>] <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has collected significant amounts of
        valuable intelligence from areas outside the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the
        Soviet Orbit. A number of high quality, secret sources have been developed in selected
        areas, capable of producing important clandestine intelligence, often with strategic
        implications.</p>
       <p>Although substantial progress has been made, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has not
        yet achieved a satisfactory collection of intelligence on and from the <gloss
         target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the satellites. The tremendously effective State
        Security apparatus of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the Soviet Orbit make
        this primary target extremely difficult to attack. Intensive efforts have been expended in
        an attempt to develop within the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the satellite
        countries a secure clandestine intelligence apparatus capable of supporting and providing
        communications for agent operations. The collection of intelligence from these areas is
        increasing.</p>
       <p>The reduction of available overt intelligence sources by Soviet and satellite security
        precautions imposes upon <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> a responsibility for the
        collection of intelligence through espionage and counterespionage to a degree unparalleled
        in the past. In view of this and since available espionage and counterespionage facilities
        are not sufficient to fulfill present intelligence requirements, a mechanism for assigning
        over-all priorities to intelligence requirements levied on <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
         >CIA</gloss> by the various U.S. intelligence agencies has been established through the
        Interagency Priorities Committee, a subcommittee of the Intelligence Advisory Committee. In
        general terms, the topmost priority within this framework is being afforded to Soviet and
        satellite intentions and capabilities.</p>
       <p>Substantial progress has been made in organizing stay-behind agents in areas likely to be
        overrun in the event of further hostilities. In the face of known Soviet occupation and
        control techniques, the <pb n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0356"/>durability of such
        stay-behind nets and their ability to function for an appreciable period of time after the
        outbreak of hostilities have not been firmly established. The effective establishment of
        stay-behind and other war planning operations is conditioned upon over-all war planning by
        Defense agencies which is on a continuing basis.</p>
       <p>Counterespionage operations abroad gradually have been built up and concentrated against
        the Soviet and satellite intelligence services. They are becoming increasingly
        effective.</p>

      <p>The basic handicap of the program is, of course, the paucity of intelligence of all types,
       covert and overt, on the Soviet Orbit. Nevertheless, atomic estimates, though still
       uncertain, are more reliable than a year ago. A number of “finds” in Soviet electronics and
       telecommunications have been made. Intelligence on air defense and on basic scientific
       research is improved. New economic sources and techniques promise better intelligence on
       Soviet military production. Use of foreign radio broadcasts was good. Target research
       progressed. The <gloss target="#t_NIS1">NIS</gloss> program (world-wide encyclopedic data) is
       45% complete on the 24 highest-priority areas, and 22% complete as a whole. <gloss
        target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> intelligence requirements are being met.</p>
      <p>Despite the fact that espionage within the Orbit has failed to produce significant results,
       outside the Orbit it is generally good. A number of stay-behind nets have been
       established.</p>
      <p>Improvement is needed in coordination between intelligence and policy and between
       intelligence and operational planning, although the <pb n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0357"
       />national estimates are now effectively drawing upon governmental resources. Political,
       social, and cultural intelligence research-in-depth is needed for areas outside the Orbit.
       Enemy long-range plans and intentions, especially in Korea, are not known. Knowledge of the
       Soviet guided missile program is poor. Collection by the Service attachés is inadequate.
       Further exploitation of aerial reconnaissance is indicated. Knowledge of Soviet work in the
       field of radio jamming and in biological and chemical warfare is inadequate. Psychological
       and economic warfare have created unparalleled demands for intelligence.</p>
      <p>There is no guarantee that intelligence will be able to furnish adequate warning of attack
       prior to actual detection of hostile formations. Certain last-minute defensive and offensive
       preparations may, however, be detected; opportunities for such detection vary from fair (in
       Germany and Korea) to extremely poor (in Transcaucasia and Southeast Asia).</p>

      <p>I refer to the memorandum<note n="2" xml:id="d129fn2">Printed below as Attachment 1.</note>
       handed you by the Director of Central Intelligence at the <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss>
       meeting last Thursday, October 9, which outlines <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General
        Smith</persName>’s recommendation that (in his own words): “The responsibility for guiding
       policy, for approving projects, and for assessing the results of all covert cold war
       operations be placed upon the Psychological Strategy Board; and b) the present
       representatives of the Departments of State, Defense and Joint Chiefs of Staff now charged
       with giving policy guidance to the operating divisions of this Agency (or personnel of equal
       stature and experience) be grouped as a cold war general staff with the Director of the
        <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> staff as Chief thereof, and be given additional
       responsibility of considering proposed projects, <pb n="329" xml:id="pg_329" facs="0358"/>of
       recommending these projects for approval or disapproval by the Board, of periodic evaluation
       of the conduct of these projects, and of recommending periodically whether they are to be
       continued or discontinued.” <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> goes on to
       say that “The <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss>, as presently constituted, has not so far
       accomplished all of the results which I myself had hoped for.” He believes that the concepts
       and suggestions he makes in these informal memoranda would make the <gloss target="#t_PSB1"
        >PSB</gloss> “a really meaningful body as it would in fact become the device through which
       all of our major cold war activities are considered and approved.”</p>
      <p>A meeting was held in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFG1">Frank G. Wisner</persName>’s office
       on October 10 at which were present in addition to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFG1"
        >Wisner</persName>, Admiral <persName>Kirk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MBGJUSA1"
        >General Magruder</persName>, Mr. <persName>Tracy Barnes</persName>, and myself, at your
       direction. As you know, Mr. <persName>Barnes</persName> took over a week ago as Assistant
       Director of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> for <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>.
       The purpose of the meeting was to discuss <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General
        Smith</persName>’s memorandum and it was thoroughly understood that the meeting was
       exploratory and that no commitments were expected or would be made until the important
       suggestions and recommendations in <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>’s
       memorandum were thoroughly understood. Admiral <persName>Kirk</persName> stated that he had
       had long conversations with <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> about the
       latter’s thinking relating to the <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> role in clandestine
       political warfare. He remarked that he was in general agreement with <persName
        corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>. Both <persName corresp="#p_MBGJUSA1">General
        Magruder</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFG1">Wisner</persName> had also discussed
       the matter with <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> and they had clear
       ideas as to what the latter was driving at. It was generally agreed that the kernel of
        <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>’s thought was contained in the
       sentence starting at the bottom of page 1 of his memorandum which states: “Moreover, under
       the existing mechanism for providing policy guidance and program approval, the Agency has
       continued in the position of having to assume too much responsibility and authority for its
       own good.” He goes on to say that “the rapidly increasing cost of covert operations, coupled
       with the missing elements of objective review and substantive audit, leave it open to
       departmental and Congressional criticism.”</p>
      <p>During the meeting I took occasion to clarify certain points in <persName
        corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>’s memorandum which did not appear to me entirely
       clear: <list>
        <label>1)</label>
        <item>In speaking of “all of our major cold war activities,” did <persName
          corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> confine his recommendations only to political
         warfare by clandestine means or was he thinking in terms of overt propaganda as well? The
         answer was that he was thinking only of covert activity.</item>
        <label>2)</label>
        <item>In outlining his concept of the duties of the “advisers and staff officers of the
         three principals,” it was not clear as to whether these persons would be <gloss
          target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> officials or officials of their respective departments and
         agencies, i.e., State, Defense, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and perhaps the <gloss
          target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. The answer was that these persons who would backstop the
         Board members would be representatives of their respective departments and agencies where
         they would have their offices and perform their functions.</item>
        <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0359"/>
        <label>3)</label>
        <item>When <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> spoke of his objection to
         the formal reference of cold war projects to the routine machinery of the major departments
         and the inevitable delays and breaches of security that this process involves, did he mean
         to shut off the sometimes necessary and fruitful direct working relationships between
         senior <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> officials and senior State Department officials
         on the working level? The answer to this question was no, but it was believed that
          <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> desired a rigidly controlled,
         lateral working relationship held to more senior and responsible officials who were in a
         better position to give the necessary advice and clearances.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_MBGJUSA1">General Magruder</persName> stated that he was very much in
       favor of <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>’s basic concept. He commented
       that the atmosphere within the Defense establishment relating to clandestine and
       unconventional activities had changed very greatly over the past two years. These activities
       at their outset were not clearly understood or appreciated by the Military who took an
       understandably negative view of mysteries and “unconventionality” which cut across
       established orthodox channels and straightforward military concepts. These attitudes within
       the Defense establishment had been greatly ameliorated and now the attitudes of top people
       within the Services and within the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> vis-à-vis covert
       operations reflected much more awareness of the necessity for political warfare and all types
       of covert activities. He went on to say that, although it was still difficult for any group
       including a representative of the Secretary of Defense to commit the three Services to
       logistical support, nevertheless these difficulties could now be met much more easily within
       the Defense establishment. <persName corresp="#p_MBGJUSA1">General Magruder</persName>
       commented that, in his opinion, expeditious clearances for covert activities and Department
       of Defense “no objection” or “yes, please do the most you can” were now possible as long as
       the activities did not impinge upon the basic constitutional and legislative powers and
       authority of the Military establishment.</p>
      <p>I think that we should examine very closely <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General
        Smith</persName>’s concept of the assistant, staff officer, or deputy to support each <gloss
        target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> member. He envisages “highly qualified officers … upon whom the
       principals could rely completely as their technical advisers and <hi rend="italic">whom their
        respective Departments would accept in that status.</hi> It would be essential that these
       selected officers would have the competence to speak authoritatively and definitively on the
       various matters to be considered …” <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>
       qualifies this rather startling allocation of authority by stating that: “The selected staff
       officers would have to be held responsible by the principals for the necessary amount of
       coordinating and checking in their departments.”</p>
      <p>I do not believe that this is a workable concept. No State Department official would have
       the necessary qualifications to fulfill such responsible functions as I believe are envisaged
       under <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>’s concept of a “Board of
       Directors for all covert cold war activities.” I do <pb n="331" xml:id="pg_331" facs="0360"
       />not think that the Secretary or Under Secretary would consider giving off-the-cuff
       clearances for highly sensitive political operations without first consulting the most
       competent persons in the Department of State. Certainly, no staff officer or assistant could
       or should be clothed with any such power or responsibility as this would cut across basic
       concepts of departmental handling of policy decisions. If, in any such group as envisaged by
        <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>, I or my successor should presume to
       provide policy clearance in highly sensitive fields of intimate interest to, let us say,
        <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss>, and in which, let us say, NEA has a profound interest,
       I should certainly be assassinated instanter by the Assistant Secretaries of these two
       Bureaus, and quite rightly so. It is my opinion that the present mechanism for providing
       policy guidance to <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
       works pretty well. It is perhaps administratively somewhat unorthodox, but the activity
       itself is “unconventional” and is not easily fitted into conventional and institutionally
       correct procedures.</p>
      <p>I inquired of <persName corresp="#p_WFG1">Frank Wisner</persName> if he thought that
        <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> considered that the Department of
       State was not providing adequate policy guidance under the present mechanism or whether there
       were long delays in obtaining clearances due to some of the factors set forth in <persName
        corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>’s memorandum. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFG1"
        >Wisner</persName> replied that he did not think that this was in the General’s mind, but
       rather <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>’s basic thought was that “no
       objection” on the part of the Department of State was not sufficient. He rather desired a
       mechanism which would more closely commit the Department to responsibility for sensitive and
       exceedingly costly activities directly in the field of foreign policy by other means, i.e.,
       political warfare. I may add that whenever the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> required a
       policy decision on an important matter where time was of the essence, such decision has been
       forthcoming sometimes within a matter of hours. The Deputy Under Secretary is constantly
       available for these high level decisions which have always been made in the past without
       their being referred to the lower levels and fought over by relatively junior officials. In
       other words, it is my view that <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>’s
       memorandum in this respect refers primarily to the delays, lack of sufficient logistic
       support, and security breaches which have been experienced for understandable reasons within
       the Department of Defense and the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>.</p>
      <p>With regard to the General’s insistence upon this Department assuming more responsibility
       for these activities, we must, of course, look closely into the degree of authority and
       control which must be concomitant with such responsibility. As you know, it was the concept
       of <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">General Marshall</persName>, Mr.
        <persName>Forrestal</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LRA1">Lovett</persName> and Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_KGF1">Kennan</persName>, when <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> was
       set up in the spring of 1948, that political warfare activities of covert means (excluding
       para-military operations and planning therefor in case of overt hostilities) was of primary
       interest to the Department of State. The idea was explored of placing such activity directly
       within <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0361"/>this Department, but I believe it was finally
       decided that the operation should be one step removed from this Department, and it was for
       this reason that it was placed, faute de mieux, within the framework of the <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. We are still the Department primarily interested in political
       warfare by covert means. If this is so, we should accept <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General
        Smith</persName>’s basic thesis and accept more responsibility but at the same time exercise
       closer control over operations. I inquired whether <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General
        Smith</persName> had in mind a “theater commander” concept which would mean that the
       Department would say “go ahead” and then his organization would take over and all
       implementation would be considered operational and within his exclusive responsibility. Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_WFG1">Wisner</persName> replied that this was not in <persName
        corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>’s mind as evidenced by the part of the latter’s
       memorandum where he refers to “periodic evaluation of the conduct of these projects and of
       recommending periodically whether they are to be continued or discontinued.” This concept
       would mean a much greater degree of State Department control than is presently exercised.
       When he took over the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1"
        >General Smith</persName> told the Chief of Foreign Service Personnel
        <persName>Durbrow</persName> that he could use perhaps fifty qualified Foreign Service
       Officers in a delicate operation where political know-how and area expertise is essential. We
       have never been able to meet this request, and presently there are only three or four
       qualified Foreign Service Officers serving in <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> of <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.</p>
      <p>As you are well aware, a green light for an operation or a “no objection” is entirely
       inadequate. My office has endeavored, through the weekly 10/2 representatives forum and by
       personal contacts with senior operational personnel of the <gloss target="#t_OPC1"
        >OPC</gloss> to keep abreast of political warfare operations. This has been difficult and
       sometimes these operations inevitably get off the beam. It is axiomatic that delicate
       political operations are about as good as the operators. Perhaps this adds up to the
       conclusion that if this Department accepts more responsibility, it will mean that senior
       officers of this Department must themselves devote increasing personal attention to
       monitoring <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> political warfare activities.</p>
      <p>I think that recent events in the Soviet Union fully justify <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1"
        >General Smith</persName>’s observation that “it is inevitable that cold war operations will
       continue over a long period of time.” If our conflict with Stalinism, Russian Imperialism,
       International Communism, or whatever name we give it may more and more assume the pattern of
       what we call “cold war” over an indefinite period, it seems to me that political warfare by
       clandestine means will increasingly assume major significance. The <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
        >NSC</gloss> in 10/5<note n="3" xml:id="d129fn3"><ref target="#d90">Document
        90</ref>.</note> affirmed this conclusion and called for increased scope <pb n="333"
        xml:id="pg_333" facs="0362"/>and magnitude in covert operations. <persName
        corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> speaks of the happy combination of personality
       and experience, the continuity of which is not insured. I would place more stress than he
       apparently does on his phrase “the continuity of which is not insured.” An institutional
       arrangement made at this particular juncture and based to some degree on personalities might
       be dangerous. It might work very well up until January 20, 1953. With regard to the State
       Department end of <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>’s concept, I should
       like to see, if possible, the focal point within the Department providing policy guidance and
       control for political warfare activities placed upon as high a “professional level” as
       possible.</p>
      <p>I attach hereto a memorandum addressed to me on October 10 by Mr.
        <persName>Krentz</persName> as well as a memorandum I have just received from Mr.
        <persName>Tracy Barnes</persName>. I think that both of these memoranda will assist in our
       study of the problem presented by <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>’s
       memoranda.</p>

         Information. For text of the October 30 version of this paper endorsed by the Psychological
         Strategy Board, see <ref target="#d135">Document 135</ref>.</note></p>
       <p>In the field of unconventional and psychological operations the Central Intelligence
        Agency is an executive and operating agency charged with carrying out projects in support of
        national policies. These projects include political and paramilitary operations, the general
        desirability of which have been determined by the senior departments of the Executive Branch
        of the Government. As an operating agent for these departments, <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
         >CIA</gloss> requires more than policy guidance. The actual projects which it proposes to
        undertake in furthering national policy should be carefully scrutinized before final
        approval, and the net value of the operations themselves should be periodically assessed by
        some authority outside the Agency but representative both of it and of <pb n="334"
         xml:id="pg_334" facs="0363"/>the interested executive departments. The mounting cost of
        these operations makes such prior assessment and continuous audit a matter of great
        urgency.</p>
       <p>Ever since I assumed my present responsibilities I have been trying to arrive at the best
        method of establishing within the Agency an objective method of project review and analysis,
        but without really satisfactory results. Moreover, under the existing mechanism for
        providing policy guidance and program approval, the Agency has continued in the position of
        having to assume too much responsibility and authority for its own good. Thus, the rapidly
        increasing cost of covert operations, coupled with the missing elements of objective review
        and substantive audit, leave it open to departmental and Congressional criticism. The simple
        fact is that in the field of cold war, vision and imagination are essential, but these two
        essential qualities must be held under wraps. Otherwise, the number of ways they will
        conjure up to spend money is really surprising, and the selective judgment of a detached,
        objective authority must be applied.</p>
       <p>It is inevitable that cold war operations will continue over a long period of time. The
        involve activities which do not lend themselves to precise evaluation and it is impossible
        to judge in absolute terms the successes or failures of particular programs. Unlike military
        operations which require the continuous and increasing application of force toward an abrupt
        and conclusive ending, those in which we engage usually require a fluctuating effort with no
        clear termination in prospect. For this reason, it is all the more important that they
        should not be undertaken unless all concerned are satisfied as to their desirability.</p>
       <p>The ideal situation would be for all cold war projects to be considered in detail and
        passed upon by a committee consisting of the Under Secretary of State, the Deputy Secretary
        of Defense, and the Director of Central Intelligence (the present <gloss target="#t_PSB1"
         >PSB</gloss>). However, it is not possible for these fully occupied individuals to devote
        the amount of time necessary for such direct analysis, and they would need competent and
        fully trusted advisors from their respective staffs in order to be adequately informed. I
        believe, however, that the three officials mentioned, sitting as the Psychological Strategy
        Board, can <hi rend="italic">if adequately supported</hi> perform these functions without
        too much additional burden, and they are already doing a good deal of it in an informal way
        at their weekly luncheon meetings. This, however, is the result of a happy combination of
        personalities and experience, the continuity of which is not insured. It can be insured only
        if there is a genuine acceptance of certain essential principles. The first of these is full
        recognition by the three Board members of the true significance of their role which would be
        actually to approve, guide, and assess the value of covert cold war operations, as well as
        to give the policy guidance under which these operations are planned and executed. In this
        capacity, they would be in <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0364"/>effect a board of
        directors for all covert cold war activities. Second and somewhat more difficult of
        attainment would be the provision of a few highly qualified officers within the <gloss
         target="#t_PSB1">P.S.B.</gloss> staff upon whom the principals could rely completely as
        their technical advisors, and whom their respective departments would accept in that status.
        It would be essential that these selected officers have competence to speak authoritatively
        and definitively on the various matters to be considered, both in their capacity as advisors
        and staff officers of the three principals and as representatives of the departments from
        which they are seconded. Time would be lost and insecurity would result from formal
        reference of cold war projects to the routine machinery of the major departments, since this
        would have the inevitable result of allowing these matters to get down into the depths of
        departmental staffs and to be fought over and widely discussed by a large number of
        relatively junior officials. Hence, the selected staff officers would have to be held
        responsible by the principals for the necessary amount of coordinating and checking within
        their departments.</p>
       <p>The three presently designated representatives of the Departments of State and Defense and
        the Joint Chiefs of Staff are all top quality individuals. We could not hope to get and
        would not want to have better people. It seems to me that the only difficulty is that they
        are not set up in the proper framework at the present time. They or others of equivalent
        caliber could serve as the principal advisors and assistants of the two Under Secretaries. I
        recommend, therefore, that: (a) the responsibility for guiding policy, for approving
        projects, and for assessing the results of all covert cold war operations be placed upon the
        Psychological Strategy Board; and (b) the present representatives of the Departments of
        State, Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff now charged with giving policy guidance to the
        operating divisions of this Agency (or personnel of equal stature and experience) be grouped
        as a cold war general staff with the Director of the <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss>
        staff as chief thereof, and be given the additional responsibility of considering proposed
        projects, of recommending these projects for approval or disapproval by the Board, of
        periodic evaluation of the conduct of these projects, and of recommending periodically
        whether they are to be continued or discontinued.</p>
       <p>The <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss>, as presently constituted, has not so far
        accomplished all of the results which I myself had hoped for. The concept outlined above
        would, to a certain extent, change its present character and would make it a really
        meaningful body as it would in fact become the device through which all of our major cold
        war activities are considered and approved. The present staff of the <gloss target="#t_PSB1"
         >PSB</gloss> would undergo a corresponding change with respect to its composition,
        functions and responsibilities.</p>
       <p>These are general recommendations. If they are favorably considered, they will require
        detailed analysis and staff action.</p>

         xml:id="d129fn6">Secret; Security Information.</note></p>
       <p><persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>’s draft memorandum of October 8<note
         n="7" xml:id="d129fn7">See Attachment 1 above.</note> presents a logical and convincing
        case for the appointment of deputies to the <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> members who
        would be responsible, each under the aegis of his own department, for formulating policy
        guidance and evaluation for all covert political and psychological operations. There is
        little doubt that such a set-up would enable <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to function
        more effectively and responsibly in this field and I can see certain advantages from the
        Department of State’s point of view in that decisions be by a departmental group rather than
        solely by State with tacit or other concurrence by Defense. However, I can foresee several
        serious dangers from our point of view unless this project were to be extremely carefully
        worked out in terms of our own organization.</p>
       <p>First, it seems to me that our present small office, functioning for and under the direct
        control of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHF1">Matthews</persName> is, while not perfect, a very
        effective means of pulling together day-to-day operations on the covert side with all the
        responsible political officers of the Department. We know what is going on and can work very
        closely with the Assistant Secretaries and their Deputies and are in a position constantly
        to guide the thinking of working-level people in <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>/<gloss
         target="#t_OPC1">opc</gloss>.</p>
       <p>Covert political warfare is so alien to the normal concepts of American government in the
        past, is so labyrinthine and delicate, that it seems to me maturity of judgment and
        experience plus the career officer’s intuitive sense of political factors are essential
        factors in dealing with the problem on the day-to-day working levels of the bureaus.
        Experience, I believe, will demonstrate that the deputies proposed would in a very short
        time tend to become involved exclusively in high-level decisions and relationships which
        would isolate them from the intimate contact with the diverse parts of the Department and
         <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, which we now maintain.</p>
       <p>To set up a new mechanism within the Department to perform our function seems to me
        dangerous to our ends. I think particularly the <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337" facs="0366"
        />“Secretariat” approach would tend to place these functions in a routine and perhaps an
        unimaginative context in which I do not believe they can be fitted. I am quite aware that
        our present set-up is viewed with horror by organizational and managerial eyes.
        Nevertheless, I believe the nature of the problem requires an unorthodox approach. In other
        words, if we appoint the deputies to sit in the <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss>, I
        believe they should be supported by practically the same set-up which we now have under Mr.
         <persName corresp="#p_MHF1">Matthews</persName>.</p>
       <p>We must also consider that the Deputy Under Secretary for Substantive Affairs is likely
        always to be a high-calibre substantive officer. Under the vicissitudes of our system this
        would not necessarily be true for future Under Secretaries.</p>
       <p><persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> says, “It would be essential that
        these selected officers (the deputies) have competence to speak authoritatively and
        definitively on the various matters to be considered, both in their capacity as advisors and
        staff officers of the three principals and as representatives of the departments from which
        they are seconded (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>). Time would be lost and insecurity would
        result from formal reference of cold war projects to the routine machinery of the major
        departments, since this would have the inevitable result of allowing these matters to get
        down into the depths of departmental staffs and to be fought over and widely discussed by a
        large number of relatively junior officials. Hence, the selected staff officers would have
        to be held responsible by the principals for the necessary amount of coordinating and
        checking within their departments.”</p>
       <p>In the last analysis this becomes a question of individuals. If we were to set this
        proposal up tomorrow the individuals would be yourself and <persName corresp="#p_MBGJUSA1"
         >General Magruder</persName>. This would work beautifully because both of you have several
        years of intimate experience, knowledge of pitfalls, extensive cooperating contacts—built up
        over several years also through selected individuals—and the requisite qualities of mind for
        the job. Here also we would run into the violent objection of managers that you cannot rely
        upon individuals. Any comparably competent officers must be able to take over at any time. I
        think this is the exception that proves the rule. With the departure of yourself shortly and
        the possible departure of <persName corresp="#p_MBGJUSA1">General Magruder</persName> at any
        time, I have a strong feeling that we might be getting into a very undesirable position.
        Furthermore, I do not think <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>’s
        generalization as to Departmental staffs can be applied to the Department of State as it
        could to <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> or to the Pentagon. Our substantive staffs are
        relatively small and highly coordinated in the traditional pattern of Foreign Office
        operation.</p>
       <p>This matter of our own internal set-up should have the most careful consideration before
        we agree to modifications. This is something which is going to take a large amount of
        thought and foresight, but my <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0367"/>first reaction is
        that to be successful we should have to maintain something within our own building very
        similar to what we have now.</p>
       <p>I am thoroughly in accord with <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>’s
        stresses on the need for constant evaluation of covert programs and auditing even as to
        detail. Carefully worked out, the mechanism he proposes might be the best means of achieving
        this.</p>

      <p>As you are aware, under <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Directives the Department of
       State has certain responsibilities for providing political guidance to the organization
       within the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> which engages in certain activities which
       might be generally referred to as within the field of political warfare. Primary
       responsibility for providing this counsel, advice, guidance and control is vested in Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_MHF1">H. Freeman Matthews</persName>, and I have responsibility as his
       subordinate for the day to day operation of this function. In the performance of these
       duties, members of this office and I on occasion consult with you when important policy
       matters are under consideration. The ordinary relationship is, however, with the various
       Deputy Assistant Secretaries and the office Directors and their <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339"
        facs="0368"/>Deputies. On occasion, when a particular situation in a particular country
       demands and is receiving close attention by the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, officers
       in charge are brought in.</p>
      <p>My colleagues (<persName>Kenneth C. Krentz</persName>, <persName>Lampton Berry</persName>,
        <persName>William McFadden</persName>) and I arrange personal meetings where the appropriate
       official of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is able to consult directly with the
       appropriate official of the Department of State. I have found it desirable to attend these
       meetings or to see to it that one of my colleagues is present. On occasion, when the <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is engaging in important operations in a particular country in
       a rapidly developing situation, my office has authorized a continuing and sometimes daily
       direct relationship between the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> official concerned and
       the appropriate officer of the Department. In all these contacts, however, my office is kept
       advised as to the nature of the business and the decisions, if any, which were taken. This
       liaison control has proved to be necessary in order that I may be in a position to be
       continuously aware of the political advice being supplied to <gloss target="#t_OPC1"
        >OPC</gloss> of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and in order that matters of importance
       may be brought to the attention of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHF1">Matthews</persName> for
       final decision.</p>
      <p><gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has expanded
       very rapidly indeed during the past four years. From a small group of about [<hi
        rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>] persons in 1948, I believe the organization now
       has on its rolls some [<hi rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>] persons. The
       activities of this section of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> have expanded enormously in
       scope and magnitude on a world wide basis. This situation has meant (up until recently, for
       reasons which need not be gone into here) that requests for political guidance and
       consequently the need for increasing direct contact between <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss> officials and officers of the Department of State has greatly increased. The
       job of channelizing and controlling these contacts has been difficult but, in my opinion,
       necessary both in the interests of security and efficiency in seeing to it that <gloss
        target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> obtains the most carefully considered advice from the most
       competent and responsible officers in the Department.</p>
      <p>A great number of officers of <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> of <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> are on terms of personal friendship with many political
       officers of this Department, and there has been a continuing tendency for informal contacts
       between such persons on both sides of the house. It is very difficult, and sometimes
       undesirable, to endeavor to control too stringently these relationships which are
       occasionally fruitful. On the other hand, these personal relationships sometimes work against
       important security considerations, and on occasion the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
       man talks operations with his Department of State friend who may talk policy. There have been
       occasions when contacts of this nature result in the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> man
       considering that he has obtained a policy view or even on occasion a green light from his
       Departmental contact. In addition to these informal contacts, there is a constant disposition
       on the part of some <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> officials to deal directly <pb
        n="340" xml:id="pg_340" facs="0369"/>with his “opposite number” in the Department of State
       at times without clearance within the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> or with my office.
       I believe it will be understood that although certain “opposite number” contacts are on
       occasion desirable, they should nevertheless be controlled. There have been instances in the
       past when <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> officials have considered and reported that
       they have received policy decisions or “no objection” responses from certain Departmental
       officers following direct and uncoordinated contacts.</p>
      <p>This situation has been discussed on many occasions with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFG1"
        >Frank Wisner</persName>, who has had his own difficulties within the <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> in controlling and channeling relationships between <gloss
        target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> and the Department of State. Recently Ambassador
        <persName>Lewis Clark</persName>, who is presently with the <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss>, has been placed in control of liaison between <gloss target="#t_OPC1"
        >OPC</gloss> of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and this Department. He is preparing an
       inventory of all contacts between <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> officials and political
       officers of this Department. He is discovering that there have developed relationships such
       as described in the preceding paragraph and that these contacts sometimes caused confusion
       and duplication. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CGRM1">Clark</persName> is tightening up this
       liaison relationship within <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>, and his office will be the
       clearing house for all meetings between <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> officers and the
       political officers of the Department of State. He has requested, and I have agreed, that a
       renewed endeavor be made within this Department to insure that all meetings involving policy
       guidance shall be arranged for or passed upon by my office.</p>
      <p>The purpose of this memorandum is to request that you bring this matter to the attention of
       your Deputy and your office Directors. It might be suggested to them that they should have no
       further direct dealings with <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> officials on policy matters
       without clearance with my office. Only in exceptional cases, should contact be below the
       Deputy office director level. Exceptions should be cleared by my office and the office
       director concerned. I am sure that you will understand that there is no desire on my part to
       interpose myself or to choke off useful and desirable contacts between officials of the
        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and appropriate political officers of the Department. I
       believe that you will agree that this degree of control is necessary in order to 1) prevent
       misunderstandings of the Department’s position from developing within the <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>; 2) insure that political advice and guidance proffered by one
       Departmental official is coordinated with other areas of the Department; 3) maintain a
       necessary degree of security with regard to the operations of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss> and the relationship between <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> and the
       Department of State under <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Directives, and 4) insure that
       all substantive and important policy guidance decisions are placed before Deputy Under
       Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MHF1">Matthews</persName>.</p>

        CONTINENTAL US</p>
       <p rend="center">Problem</p>
       <p>1. To prepare a summary evaluation of the net capability of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
         >USSR</gloss>, as of mid-1952, to injure the continental United States.</p>
       <p rend="center">Scope</p>
       <p>2. This evaluation considers the injury which could be inflicted on the continental United
        States by <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> military action and Soviet-inspired sabotage
        in connection with the initial attack and in connection with attacks immediately following.
        The US has substantial strengths in being outside the continental United States, and no
        estimate is expressed herein as to the effect of a Soviet attack on such strengths or the
        likelihood that the Soviet will allocate parts of its striking power to such an attack.</p>
       <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
       <p>3. The Soviet Union, as of mid-1952, has the net capability to inflict serious but not
        permanently crippling damage to the continental strengths of the United States.</p>
       <p>4. This Soviet capability is primarily that of surprise air attack using atomic bombs. The
        Soviet capability for inflicting direct damage on the US by sabotage is small by comparison
        with damage that could be inflicted by an atomic air attack. However, sabotage in
        conjunction with <pb n="344" xml:id="pg_344" facs="0373"/>an atomic air attack could
        significantly increase the total physical and psychological impact. Such sabotage could
        include the use of atomic weapons smuggled into the US if the <persName>Kremlin</persName>
        were disposed to accept the considerably increased risk of premature disclosure which this
        operation would entail.</p>
       <p>5. The Soviet stockpile of atomic bombs, as of mid-1952, is probably appreciably less than
        100. The nature and extent of the damage that could be inflicted by a surprise air attack,
        involving the launching against US targets of the entire Soviet stockpile of atomic bombs,
        would vary according to the objectives governing the selection of targets.</p>
       <list>
        <label>a.</label>
        <item>An attack on US targets selected with the objective of inflicting maximum overall
         damage to US armament production capacity and military power would probably prevent the US
         from regaining its current armament production capacity and military power for a period of
         the order of 2 years.</item>
        <label>b.</label>
        <item>An attack on US targets selected with the primary objective of neutralizing US atomic
         capabilities (see sub-paragraph 6-a) would probably not prevent an atomic counter attack
         from the continental US of a size unacceptable to the Soviet Union in the light of its
         present defenses and vulnerabilities.</item>
        <label>c.</label>
        <item>An attack on US targets selected with the primary objective of neutralizing US ability
         to sustain large scale military operations and to produce new weapons of critical
         importance (see sub-paragraphs 6-b and 6-c), could, under circumstances considered probable
         for the enemy, achieve such neutralization for a period of the order of 6 to 12
         months.</item>
        <label>d.</label>
        <item>Regardless of the primary objective of the attack or the basis of target selection,
         the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is incapable of inflicting by such attack
         sufficient mass casualties or disorganization to force US government changes or decisions
         acceptable to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> (see sub-paragraph 6-d).</item>
       </list>
       <p rend="center">Objectives of the Attacks</p>
       <p>6. We believe that any military action or sabotage undertaken by the <gloss
         target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> against the continental US would be for the purposes listed
        below. Achievement of the first three of these objectives is, for the present at least,
        essential to the ultimate success of any Soviet war plan against the western powers.</p>
       <list>
        <label>a.</label>
        <item>To prevent the launching of atomic attacks against the Soviet Union in the light of
         its defenses and vulnerabilities. Probable primary targets would include Strategic Air
         Command bases, aircraft and control centers, atomic production facilities and storage
         sites.</item>
        <label>b.</label>
        <item>To neutralize US ability to sustain large scale military operations. Probable primary
         targets would include concentrated industries critical and basic to war production; basic
         services, including power and transport; ports and Naval bases; and atomic production
         facilities.</item>
        <pb n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0374"/>
        <label>c.</label>
        <item>To neutralize US ability to develop or produce any new weapons of critical importance.
         Probable primary targets would include Atomic Energy key facilities for new development,
         guided missile production and test installations, and applied research facilities.</item>
        <label>d.</label>
        <item>To so neutralize the general industrial, economic, and psychological strength of the
         US that government decisions or changes acceptable to the Soviet Union would occur, or
         could be forced by additional pressures elsewhere in the world. Pursuit of this objective
         would probably involve an effort to inflict mass casualities and cause disorganization in
         urban areas. Probable primary targets would include all those listed for other more
         specific purposes in sub-paragraphs 6-a, 6-b, and 6-c above, with the additional targets of
         government control centers, population centers, and miscellaneous industry and supplies
         wherever concentrated.</item>

       <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Air Attacks.</hi> By far the most effective means available to the
         <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for injuring the continental United States in the
        initial stage of hostilities is air attack with atomic bombs. It is estimated that the
         <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is capable of carrying out air attacks against any
        target in the continental United States and Canada. Some targets listed as essential to its

           <item>The net success in penetrating the US defenses in terms of bombs on target would
            vary with the avenues chosen, the methods of attack and depth of targets inside
            peripheral defenses, character of individual targets and their local defenses, and the
            degree of surprise attained. It is estimated that 65 to 85 per cent of bombs launched
            could <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346" facs="0375"/>be delivered on target in an attack aimed
            at US armament production facilities and military strength in general.</item>

         <label>b.</label>
         <item><hi rend="italic">Effectiveness of Air Attack with Atomic Bombs</hi>. As of mid-1952,
          the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> probably had a stockpile of 50 bombs of
          approximately 20 KT yield, or the equivalent in bombs of different yields. It is possible
          that the number of bombs was as low as 25 or as high as 100. <list>
           <label>(1)</label>
           <item>Assuming that (1) the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had a stockpile of 100
            bombs, (2) all were allotted to the optimum targets in the US, (3) all were dropped with
            near optimum placement, and (4) the entire attack was delivered in a short period, the
            Soviet Union could inflict sufficient damage to prevent the US from regaining its
            present armament production capacity and military power for at least two years. However,
            the actual <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> stockpile is probably appreciably less
            than 100 atomic weapons; optimum target selection is improbable; and it is probable that
            the number of bombs delivered on target would be only 65 to 85 per cent of those
            launched. Consequently the probable delay in recovery of US armament production capacity
            and military power might well be less than two years.</item>
           <label>(2)</label>
           <item>If the probable Soviet stockpile of atomic bombs were used against US targets
            selected with a view to preventing the launching of US atomic weapons (see sub-paragraph
            6-a), we believe that the percentage of bombs on target would be substantially less than
            65 to 85 percent. This estimate is based on the nature and location of the targets and
            on the fact that the aircraft element in these targets is mobile. Such an attack, under
            circumstances considered probable for the enemy, would probably not prevent an atomic
            counter attack from the continental US of a size unacceptable to the Soviet Union in the
            light of its present defenses and vulnerabilities.<note n="9" xml:id="d131fn9">As noted

            considered probable for the enemy, substantial neutralization of these US capabilities

           <item><hi rend="italic">Key Military Installations</hi> (including command facilities and
            other facilities essential for logistical support of the military within an area).
            Sabotage capabilities are slight in view of present deployment and readiness of area
            military forces and other protective countermeasures.</item>
           <label>(3)</label>
           <item><hi rend="italic">Port Facilities</hi>. Substantial sabotage capabilities exist,
            since the program for safeguarding port facilities, adopted after evaluation of the
            risks involved, has necessarily been limited primarily to major ports. Even this limited
            program is proving difficult to implement in full.</item>
           <label>(4)</label>
           <item><hi rend="italic">Forests</hi>. Sabotage capabilities consist chiefly of arson.
            Present forest protection facilities are inadequate to prevent a substantial increase in
            forest fire loss through sabotage. However, it is believed that such losses would be
            limited to an extent that U.S. war strength would not be critically affected.</item>
           <label>(5)</label>
           <item><hi rend="italic">Crops and Livestock</hi>. While existing measure for safeguarding
            the nation’s food supply are not adequate to prevent unconventional attacks, they might
            serve to minimize damage thereto from such attacks. It is believed that losses in this
            category would be limited to an extent that U.S. war strength would not be critically
            affected.</item>
           <label>(6)</label>
           <item><hi rend="italic">Public Water Supplies</hi> are generally vulnerable to temporary
            and local <gloss target="#t_BW1">BW</gloss> contamination. The introduction of
            contaminants into water already in a circulating system is a greater danger than such
            introduction on watersheds or in reservoirs.</item>
           <label>(7)</label>
           <item><hi rend="italic">Essential Government Administrative Operations</hi>. Saboteurs
            have some capability for assassination of key government officials, notwithstanding
            protective measures to which they have been alerted. Saboteurs also have the capability
            for disrupting the continuity of essential and other government operations by the
            clandestine introduction of chemical or biological agents into public buildings. Against
            this capability, existing countermeasures are only slightly effective.</item>
          </list></item>
         <label>c.</label>
         <item><p><hi rend="italic">Sabotage Devices</hi>. Potential saboteurs can readily obtain a
           wide variety of sabotage devices, including chemical and biological agents. They can also
           obtain or produce non-fissionable component parts of atomic bombs. Each of the foregoing
           is available in the United States or procurable through smuggling, for which substantial
           opportunities exist over United States land and sea frontiers and through abuse of
           diplomatic immunity and courtesy. There also exists the possibility of introducing
           assembled atomic bombs from abroad by such smuggling. The effective limit on sabotage
           capability will continue to be determined by <pb n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0378"/>US
           controls on movements of persons and materials and on access to critical targets rather
           than by the availability of sabotage devices.</p>
          <p>With regard to <gloss target="#t_BW1">BW</gloss> agents, programs pertaining to disease
           reporting, immunization, research, training, stockpiling, alertness, protection of
           veterinary biologicals and physical security of essential buildings are under way in the
           appropriate agencies. Satisfactory execution of these programs is essential to adequate
           defense against overt as well as clandestine biological warfare attack.</p></item>
         <label>d.</label>
         <item><hi rend="italic">Non-physical Sabotage</hi>. While the continued propaganda and
          other subversive efforts of the Communists probably are not without some result, the
          prosecutions of national and local Communist leaders, plus the increasing awareness of the
          American public of the seriousness of this threat, are reducing the Communist potential in
          this field.</item>

      <p rend="center">NATIONAL PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFORT FOR THE PERIOD JULY 1, 1952 THROUGH SEPTEMBER
       30, 1952</p>
      <p>[Omitted here are a title page, a copy of the November 3 transmittal memorandum from
       Director <persName>Alan G. Kirk</persName> to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Executive
       Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName>, and a Table of Contents.]</p>
      <p rend="center">I. Significant Psychological Activities During the Period Under Review</p>
      <p>1. The Board presents below a brief evaluative summary of psychological activities during
       the reporting period on the part of the departments and agencies responsible for
       psychological operations.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Capabilities by Area</hi></p>
      <p>2. Some progress toward our psychological goals has been achieved in certain areas. Wide
       geographical gaps remain, however, in <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0385"/>our
       capabilities for making an immediately effective psychological contribution to the reduction
       and retraction of Soviet power and influence. These gaps include the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
        >USSR</gloss> itself, Communist China and most of the European satellites. In other areas
       there has been progress, especially in building capabilities for future development.</p>
      <p>3. Radio broadcasting currently is the major active element being employed in the
       psychological field against the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The Russian “jamming”
       continues to be a serious obstacle, and poses a problem in the whole field of communications.
       Insofar as Communist China is concerned, the situation is about the same but probably with
       less receptivity due to shortages of receiving facilities among the masses.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Anti-American Attitudes</hi></p>
      <p>4. In the free world and especially in Western Europe, specific grievances and generalized
       discontents continue to find expression in anti-American sentiments and resentments of overt
       United States propaganda and pressure. During the reporting period a substantial increase was
       made in the volume of guidance and support material for indirect and non-attributable
       propaganda. However, the above trend makes clear the importance of still further increasing
       our efforts to develop indirect and non-attributable information activities.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Western Europe</hi></p>
      <p>5. The benefactor-beneficiary relationship in this area continues to cause difficulty for
       our psychological efforts to develop attitudes favorable to the position-of-strength
       strategy. European enthusiasm continues to lag for institutions looked on as specifically
       military, i.e., <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and EDC. However, U.S. psychological
       action has contributed to an increasing awareness of the communist danger in some countries,
       notably France and Sweden; to the development of pro-integration attitudes in Western
       Germany; and to progress toward European functional and political unity. All these gains,
       taken together with the growth of military strength in Europe, contributed to counteracting
       the spread of neutralist sentiments.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Middle East</hi></p>
      <p>6. The political crisis in Iran has materially reduced U.S. capabilities to influence the
       present trend of events in that country, though some limited results of non-attributable
       activities are reported. The danger of further deterioration in Iran emphasizes the
       importance of rapid preparation of psychological activities in neighboring countries, where
       repercussions of such deterioration would be felt. In Egypt, the political crisis similarly
       reduced current capabilities, but the present situation contains both favorable and
       unfavorable elements that make the future uncertain. In the area as a whole, little progress
       in the psychological <pb n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0386"/>field can be reported for the
       quarter toward the achievement of national policy objectives. A notable contribution to the
       national psychological effort in the area, however, was the airlift by the United States Air
       Force of some 3,800 Moslem pilgrims from Beirut to Jidda.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Far East</hi></p>
      <p>7. In Southeast Asia, awareness of United States aid was increased appreciably during the
       reporting period by the psychological impact of TCA and MSA agricultural, public health, and
       other aid programs. Psychological capabilities in Southeast Asia have been expanded,
       especially in the non-attributable field, but little increase in current effectiveness is
       reported. The tendency in the area to identify the United States with European colonial
       powers, and with indigenous leadership groups which are opposed by revolutionary nationalist
       movements, continues to present a psychological obstacle. In Japan, certain non-attributable
       activities in the labor field continue to make progress.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Korea</hi></p>
      <p>8. Aside from direct psychological warfare in support of hostilities, the psychological
       effort in Korea has exerted pressure on the communists for an armistice and has stressed the
       principle of voluntary repatriation of prisoners of war. This principle has gained widespread
       acceptance in the non-communist world.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">“Hate America” Propaganda</hi></p>
      <p>9. All the reporting departments and agencies have been concerned with combatting the
       Soviet-Communist “Hate America” propaganda campaign. A large volume of guidance and support
       material on this subject was provided for both overt and non-attributable propaganda
       channels. Emphasis was placed on the absurdity and evil purpose of the hate campaign. Special
       steps were taken to coordinate the release by the Department of Defense and its components of
       information on biological and chemical warfare. The effectiveness of these activities cannot
       be gauged in isolation from other United States operations.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Military Assets for the “Cold War”</hi></p>
      <p>10. A number of actions and programs of the Department of Defense and the military services
       during the reporting period, particularly in Western Europe and the Middle East, illustrate
       the type of contribution these services can make to the national psychological effort.
       However, it is noted that there remains an unexploited potential for the use of military
       psychological warfare assets in support of approved national peacetime programs; but that
       considerable difficulty is encountered in exploiting this potential in the absence of
       specific authority and missions upon which military psychological activities in peacetime may
       be based. The feasibility of making such a delineation is under study.</p>

        <item>Procedure for <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/5 Matters</item>
       </list>
       <p>In the field of unconventional and psychological operations the Central Intelligence
        Agency is an executive and operating agency charged with carrying out projects in support of
        national policies. These projects include political and paramilitary operations, the general
        desirability of which have been determined by the senior departments of the Executive Branch
        of the Government. As an operating agent for these departments, <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
         >CIA</gloss> requires more than policy guidance. The programs and major projects which it
        proposes to undertake in furthering national policy should be carefully scrutinized before
        final approval, and the net value of the operations themselves should be periodically
        assessed by some authority outside the Agency, but representative both of it and of the
        interested executive departments. The mounting cost of these operations makes such prior
        assessment and continuous audit a matter of great urgency.</p>
       <p>Under the existing mechanism for providing policy guidance and program approval, the
        Agency has continued in the position of having to assume too much responsibility and
        authority. While in the field of cold war both vision and imagination are essential, yet
        these qualities must be controlled by selective judgment of a detached, objective
        authority.</p>
       <p>It is inevitable that cold war operations will continue over a long period of time. They
        involve activities which do not lend themselves to precise evaluation and it is impossible
        to judge in absolute terms the successes or failures of particular programs. Unlike military
        operations which require the continuous and increasing application of force toward an abrupt
        and conclusive ending, activities of this type require a <pb n="360" xml:id="pg_360"
         facs="0389"/>fluctuating effort with no clear termination in prospect. For this reason, it
        is all the more important that they should not be undertaken unless all concerned are
        satisfied as to their desirability.</p>
       <p>The responsibilities in their respective departments of the individuals who make up the
         <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss>, and the demands made upon their time, are such as to
        preclude their giving detailed study, analysis and review to the covert operations of <gloss
         target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. There is needed a method by which these persons can depend,
        in the exercise of their responsibilities as members of <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss>,
        on the recommendations of qualified subordinates, reserving their personal detailed
        consideration for those cases and matters which, by their nature, require their direct
        attention.</p>
       <p>Here I have in mind the provision of a few highly qualified officers upon whom the
        principals could rely completely as their technical advisers, and whom their respective
        departments would accept in that status. It would be essential that these selected officers
        have competence to speak with the greatest degree of authority compatible with the
        individual responsibilities of the members of the <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> on the
        various matters to be considered, both in their capacity as advisers and staff officers of
        the three principals and as representatives of the departments from which they are seconded.
        Time would be lost and insecurity would result from formal reference of cold war projects to
        the routine machinery of the major departments, since this would have the inevitable result
        of allowing these matters to get down into the depths of departmental staffs and to be
        fought over and widely discussed by a large number of relatively junior officials. Hence,
        the selected staff officers would have to be held responsible by the principals for the
        necessary amount of coordinating and checking within their departments.</p>
       <p>The Board set up a Panel in its paper dated February 20, 1952, subject: “Procedure for
        Handling 10/5 Matters in <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss>”.<note n="4" xml:id="d135fn4"
          ><ref target="#d104">Document 104</ref>.</note> It is not equipped nor staffed for prompt
        and decisive action. Panels of this size and nature tend to be slowed down by procedural
        matters, and their energy dissipated.</p>
       <p>I believe a smaller group consisting of one representative from each of the Departments of
        State and Defense and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, and with the Director of <gloss
         target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> as permanent chairman, can produce the results we desire,
        provided these representatives have the work of this group to which they are assigned as
        their primary responsibility, to take priority over any other work even, if necessary, to
        the exclusion of other duties. I believe the Joint Chiefs of Staff should provide an advisor
        to this Group and the Departments and Agency should furnish aides and clerical assistance as
        may be necessary.</p>
       <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0390"/>
       <p>I would stress to each Member of the Board the importance of selecting a high-quality
        representative for this Group. Representatives on the present Panel are excellent, but
        unhappily will not be available to us much longer. Replacements must be found of similar
        stature, and who will have the complete confidence of their respective departments and
        agency. Needless to say, they require full support from the very top. The success of this
        project will depend upon the persons selected by us.</p>
       <p>Specifically, I recommend the Board amend its previous decisions in this field and follow
        the procedure set forth below except in such cases as may be otherwise provided by the
        President.</p>
       <list>
        <label>(1)</label>
        <item>Each Board member should designate as a member of a reviewing group a senior
         representative from his department or agency who will be competent to represent such member
         in the review of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/5 programs and projects and to make
         recommendations thereon. When designated, such individual should be fully empowered to
         obtain quick, responsive and effective action on any such program and project from any
         level of his department. The work incident to his assignment to this group should have
         priority over any other work so that he will be sufficiently free of other duties to give
         all the time necessary for such review. In the case of the Department of Defense, a general
         or flag officer representative of the Joint Chiefs of Staff should also be designated as
         military adviser to the reviewing group.</item>
        <label>(2)</label>
        <item>The Director of <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> should chair the reviewing
         group.</item>
        <label>(3)</label>
        <item>The reviewing group should not only review <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/5
         programs and major projects in the first instance and recommend their approval or
         disapproval either in whole or in part, but should also periodically review such programs
         and projects and recommend whether they are to be continued or discontinued, speeded or
         slowed, increased or decreased.</item>
        <label>(4)</label>
        <item>The reviewing group should propose to the <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> such
         amendments to the present 10/5 Procedure as will implement the above recommendations, and
         thereafter propose to the <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> any further procedures which
         will enable the group efficiently to expedite its review responsibility.</item>
        <label>(5)</label>
        <item>Final action in each case will be taken by the <gloss target="#t_PSB1"
         >PSB</gloss>.</item>
       </list>
       <p>If this procedure is concurred in, I recommend that it be brought formally to the notice
        of the National Security Council as the method which will be followed by the Board in
        carrying out its responsibilities under <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/5.</p>

       <item>In paragraph a., the reference to specific limitations of the summary evaluation as

         it transmitted to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> a revised version of <persName

        there are still other defects in the summary evaluation.</item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>In paragraph b., your proposal for the preparation of terms of reference was adopted,
        and it was further recommended that the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> instruct you to
        report on the needs for improved machinery for preparing a more adequate evaluation of the
         <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>’s net capability to inflict direct injury on the
        United States.</item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item>The main point of controversy was your recommendation c., as clarified in paragraph c.
        of the attached Enclosure. On this point the Senior Staff decided to take no action at this
        time, on the understanding that you might feel free to put the proposal before the <gloss

       <label>5.</label>
       <item>The opposition to a Senior Staff recommendation at this time came primarily from the

        a lengthy memorandum on the subject,<note n="3" xml:id="d137fn3">Not found.</note> which it
        was felt could not be adequately considered prior to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
        meeting. It was evident from Admiral <persName>Wooldridge</persName>’s oral paraphrase that
        the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> view is that no additional machinery is needed to
        produce “Commander’s Estimates,” the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> being the agency

      <p>When the President turned to the second item on the Agenda Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1"
        >Lay</persName> called the Council’s attention to the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on
       the report and to the latest changes recommended by the Director of Central Intelligence at
       the instance of the Internal Security Committees and finally, to the two alternative
       recommendations made by the Senior Staff to replace the first two recommendations by the
       Director of Central Intelligence. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName> pointed out
       that the Senior Staff had taken no action on the third recommendation in <persName
        corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>’s memorandum.</p>
      <p>The President then asked <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> to comment
       on the proposals in his memorandum. After explaining briefly the background of the present
       evaluation, <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> summarized what he had
       heard of the discussions in the Senior Staff on the first two of his three recommendations
       and called the Council’s attention to his most recent revision of his third recommendation,
       which was at this point distributed to the members of the Council. <persName
        corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> then turned to the views of the Joint Chiefs of
       Staff and stated that he agreed with a number of the points made therein and disagreed with
       others. Firstly, there could be no question of the need for the production of so-called
       “Commander’s Estimates” for the use of the President and the National <pb n="370"
        xml:id="pg_370" facs="0399"/>Security Council. The Joint Chiefs, said <persName
        corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>, do not believe that the production of such
       estimates requires the creation of any new machinery. With this view <persName
        corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> said he could not agree, but added that if the
       present evaluation actually met all the requirements of the President and the Council there
       was, of course, nothing more to be done.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> then noted that the Joint Chiefs of
       Staff did not believe that the Director of Central Intelligence was the appropriate official
       to prepare Commander’s Estimates. With this view <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General
        Smith</persName> found himself in agreement, but he went on to say that he did not think
       that the Joint Chiefs of Staff were, themselves, the appropriate body to prepare the kind of
       estimate which the President and the Council required. The data which must be amassed to
       provide the kind of report that was required would by no means be purely military data. Those
       agencies of the Government which were concerned with passive defense, civilian defense,
       sabotage and the like, were also directly or indirectly involved in the preparation of such
       estimates. Plainly, he continued, the problem was too large and too complicated for any one
       Government agency to solve by itself. It seemed obvious to <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1"
        >General Smith</persName> that the National Security Council alone was the proper agency to
       guide and coordinate such studies. Obviously it could not do this directly, but it could do
       so by calling on the instrumentalities available to it. With all deference to the Joint
       Chiefs of Staff, concluded <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>, the problem
       which concerned the Council transcends the purely military sphere, although <persName
        corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> conceded that it might well be possible, as
       suggested by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to have that body monitor such a study provided the
       National Security Council was assured that the Joint Chiefs of Staff would make use, in its
       preparation, of the resources of all the Government agencies which were required.</p>
      <p>The President then turned to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FWC1">Foster</persName> for
       his comment, stating that the problem was obviously very controversial.</p>
      <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FWC1">Foster</persName> said he would prefer to listen
       first to the views of Mr. <persName>Gorrie</persName>, Mr. <persName>Wadsworth</persName> and
       others before stating his own.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName>Gorrie</persName><note n="6" xml:id="d138fn6"><persName>Jack
         Gorrie</persName>, Chairman of the National Security Resources Board.</note> expressed
       general agreement with the views stated by <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General
        Smith</persName> and said that he agreed with the recommendations offered to the Council by
       the Senior <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Staff.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName>Wadsworth</persName><note n="7" xml:id="d138fn7"><persName>James J.
         Wadsworth</persName>, Acting Administrator of the Federal Civil Defense
        Administration.</note> also expressed agreement with the view of <persName
        corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> that the civilian agencies would have very
       significant contributions to make in the preparation of such evaluations in the future. Mr.
        <persName>Wadsworth</persName> further pointed out that he was not in a position to be <pb
        n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0400"/>as clear on this problem as he would have liked, since
       he had not been permitted to examine the basic studies prepared by the Joint Chiefs and
       others, to back up the conclusions which appeared in the current report. Mr.
        <persName>Wadsworth</persName> concluded by stating his anxiety to be of maximum use in any
       future attempts along these lines.</p>
      <p>Again called upon for his views, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FWC1">Foster</persName>
       stated that it seemed to him that there were two fundamental points at issue. The first of
       these was the adequacy of the present report on the net capability of the Soviet Union to
       inflict damage on the United States. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FWC1">Foster</persName>
       said he was frank to admit that there were serious gaps in this report as far as it
       constituted the basis for planning United States courses of action. Some of these
       shortcomings, he added, derived from the very nature of the beast. Such evaluations as the
       one in question naturally involved the war plans of the United States. These plans are, of
       course, very sensitive and the Chiefs of Staff quite properly leaned over backward to protect
       the security of these plans. The inevitable result was to create difficulties for the
       civilian agencies, though it seemed to him that these agencies could not appropriately expect
       the Joint Chiefs to reveal the details of such plans. However, continued Secretary <persName
        corresp="#p_FWC1">Foster</persName>, he felt certain that he was speaking for the Joint
       Chiefs of Staff when he stated that they would make available everything that is really
       necessary to the production of this type of study to the appropriate civilian officials if
       the latter were in a position to establish their need to know. Furthermore, continued
       Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FWC1">Foster</persName>, the Joint Chiefs had expressed their
       readiness to provide oral presentations on the problem to whatever group of the National
       Security Council it was determined should receive such information. All-in-all, said
       Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FWC1">Foster</persName>, the present methods for producing
       such estimates were the best that had been found so far and he believed, as a first attempt,
       the present paper represented real progress even if it were obvious that further progress was
       necessary. As a suggestion to that end, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FWC1"
        >Foster</persName> thought an ad hoc committee should be set up to take a careful look at
       the problem raised by <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>’s memorandum and
       to try to determine whether further evaluations of the type under consideration should be
       coordinated by the Joint Chiefs of Staff or the Director of Central Intelligence, or by an
       augmented <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> staff.</p>
      <p>Summing up, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FWC1">Foster</persName> said that he
       recommended that the Council accept the first recommendation proposed by the Senior Staff. As
       to the second Senior Staff recommendation, with respect to the preparation of new terms of
       reference, there was some question as to whether the Council ought to accept it. Whether, as
       Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FWC1">Foster</persName> put it, they patient can actually
       diagnose his own disease. Nevertheless, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FWC1"
        >Foster</persName> stated that he had no specific recommendation to substitute for the one
       proposed by the Senior Staff.</p>
      <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0401"/>
      <p>The President then asked <persName corresp="#p_BGON1">General Bradley</persName> if he
       desired to make any comment.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_BGON1">General Bradley</persName> stated that he did not differ
       fundamentally with the views expressed by <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General
        Smith</persName>. On the whole he was inclined to believe that the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
        >NSC</gloss> Staff was the group best fitted to undertake studies such as these in the
       future. No single agency could do such studies and no single agency should try. As to the
       furnishing of information on United States capabilities and possible courses of action in the
       military field, <persName corresp="#p_BGON1">General Bradley</persName> emphasized that the
       Joint Chiefs were wholly in favor of the “need to know” rule on sensitive material. Within
       this reservation, however, the Chiefs were prepared to reveal whatever was necessary for the
       preparation of such studies. In point of fact, there were too many people who were curious
       about our war plans and had no legitimate interest in them. <persName corresp="#p_BGON1"
        >General Bradley</persName> promised that the Joint Chiefs would do anything in their power
       in order to achieve the kind of estimate needed, but would only monitor the effort as a last
       resort.</p>
      <p>Asked for his views by the President, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1"
        >Bruce</persName> stated briefly that he was in agreement with the recommendations proposed
       by the Senior Staff.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> then entered the discussion with the
       statement that he was sure the Council could clean this matter up and that the differences
       could be ironed out. This was, he said, a phase of the old argument between <gloss
        target="#t_G21">G–2</gloss> and G–3. He illustrated the dilemma with which he had been
       confronted in carrying out the task of preparing the present report by noting that he had
       recently required certain assumptions with respect to the civil defense capabilities of the
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in the contingency of an attack by the United States.
       We obtained these assumptions, he stated, from the Joint Strategic planners orally, but when
       we came to cast up the score and to write these vital assumptions into the report, this was
       not permitted because the Joint Chiefs of Staff had not acted on these assumptions. It was
       impossible to prepare a study of the net capability of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
        >USSR</gloss> to damage the United States under such procedures. Nevertheless, continued
        <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>, by the use of assumptions supplied by
       the military it was certainly possible to prepare an adequate evaluation without jeopardizing
       the security of war plans.</p>
      <p>The President stated that the current discussion had been extremely interesting and
       productive, but that it seemed to him that the problem posed in <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1"
        >General Smith</persName>’s third recommendation ought to have more study before the Council
       reached any conclusions on it. He expressed the hope that all the requisite agencies would
       get together to provide a reasonable basis for Council action at a future meeting.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> said that he thought it would be most
       helpful if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARJ1">Amory</persName>, as a representative of the
       Director of Central Intelligence, could <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0402"/>sit down
       with representatives of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in order to explain what was needed to
       achieve the right result.</p>
      <p>With this proposal Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FWC1">Foster</persName> expressed
       agreement and added that he, himself, would be glad to talk with Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_ARJ1">Amory</persName>.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName> then inquired whether it was the desire of
       the Council to accept the two recommendations proposed by the Senior Staff, but to defer
       action on the third recommendation proposed by <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General
        Smith</persName> and amended by the paper which he had circulated earlier in the meeting.
       The Council concurred in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName>’s understanding of
       the desired action.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName>Murray</persName>,<note n="8" xml:id="d138fn8">Not further identified.</note>
       speaking for the Attorney General, stated that he had one small point which involved the
       transposition of the words “as required” in the second recommendation by the Senior Staff.
       Mr. <persName>Murray</persName> stated that he was merely anxious to be assured that it was
       requisite for the Director of Central Intelligence to collaborate with all the agencies
       mentioned in this paragraph in the production of the next estimate.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName> pointed out that this was the intention of
       the present language and the Council agreed to the wording suggested by Mr.
        <persName>Murray</persName>.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName> stated that he desired to
       emphasize the fact that the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Staff had long recognized the
       need for more adequate staff studies, not only of the type which the Council was today
       considering, but to provide the basis for better policy statements generally. Where such
       studies could best be made, whether under the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Staff or
       elsewhere, was of course, he added, for the Council to decide, but there could be no doubt
       that the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Staff was generally agreed on the desirability
       of improvement. He felt that the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Staff could undertake
       this work, but some reorganization would be required.</p>
      <p>The President then repeated his view that the Council could come to no firm conclusion on
        <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>’s final recommendation at this
       meeting, but that the matter should be the subject of further study.</p>

       <item>Almost all governmental policies and actions have psychological content in that they
        bear on the minds and wills of other peoples. An attempt to formulate a national
        psychological strategy covering every intention and action having psychological impact in
        this sense would encompass every aspect of governmental activity. This would be an effort of
        unmanageable proportions. In order to formulate a national psychological strategy that will
        usefully subserve the national policy it is necessary to divide the task into separate
        aspects of manageable proportions. When we ask, “What can usefully be said about ways and
        means of bringing about a retraction of Soviet power and influence?” we have selected one
        such aspect and have stated it in such a way that we can perhaps deal with it. The following
        does not attempt to deal with the problems involved in the distribution of resources between
        cold war operations and preparations in support of overt war.</item>

       <item><gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/5, paragraph 2, directed “the Psychological
        Strategy Board to assure that its strategic concept for a national psychological program
        includes provision for covert operations designed to achieve the objectives in paragraph 1
        above.”</item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item>It is the object of this paper to outline a strategic concept for a national
        psychological program with particular reference to cold war operations under <gloss
         target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/5. These operations are primarily covert in character, but
        we believe a paper addressed to such operations will provide a concept valuable to overt
        psychological operations under <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 59/1 as well, especially
        those which are concerned with bringing about the retraction of Soviet power and
        influence.</item>
       <label>5.</label>
       <item>The general objective of psychological operations in the cold war can be subsumed under
        the general heading of contributing to the “retraction and reduction of Soviet power and
        influence” whether by operations designed to weaken Soviet power in the Communist orbit or
        by operations designed to weaken Soviet influence by strengthening the free world.</item>

       <item>Our national strategy, as defined in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 20/4,<note

          2, pp. 662</ref>–<ref target="frus1948v01p2#pg_669">669</ref>.</note> paragraph 20, is to
        “endeavor to achieve our general objectives by methods short of war.” This national strategy
        calls for efforts to “encourage and promote the gradual retraction of undue Russian power
        and influence from the present perimeter areas around traditional Russian boundaries …; to
        eradicate the myth by which people remote from Soviet military influence are held in a
        position of subservience to Moscow …; (and) to create situations which will compel the
        Soviet government to recognize the practical undesirability of acting on the basis of its
        present concepts…”</item>
       <label>7.</label>
       <item>In the absence of open hostilities, the cold war can be expected to continue in one
        form or another as long as the Soviet Union, which is to say, the Bolshevik Party, adheres
        to the aims and methods which it has pursued ever since its accession to power, within as
        well as outside the Party. Recognition of this—particularly public recognition—is necessary
        for understanding and support of continuity of effort. The overthrow of the Party by war or
        successful revolution appears to be the only certain means of forcing such changes. One is
        excluded, and the other so far beyond our current capabilities as to be presently
        unfeasible.</item>
       <pb n="377" xml:id="pg_377" facs="0406"/>
       <label>8.</label>
       <item>We are unable at present to propose a strategic concept which outlines a program
        designed to bring about a final solution of the cold war because (a) we do not have and
        cannot clearly foresee the time when we will have the capabilities, and (b), because without
        adequate capabilities the risks involved are clearly disproportionate to the probabilities
        of success. The time required to develop the necessary capabilities is so great that the
        nature of an acceptable solution cannot be determined with sufficient accuracy to serve as a
        guide. As our capabilities increase, flexibility and opportunism in the light of events
        appear presently more desirable than commitment to too specific a goal.</item>
       <label>9.</label>
       <item>We should continue to develop our capabilities for assisting revolution and continue to
        re-appraise the situation. This will require both the development of further capabilities
        for the exploitation of existing techniques and a major program for the development of new
        techniques and approaches. It is possible that the cumulative effect of retraction of Soviet
        power and influence, together with future events and the inherent problems with which the
        Soviet government and the Bolshevik Party are faced may eventually bring about sufficient
        change in their aims and methods to provide an acceptable solution. Efforts to develop our
        capabilities and to bring about such a retraction as opposed to a program for a definitive
        solution may be regarded as the interim strategic concept for a national psychological
        program.</item>
       <label>10.</label>
       <item>Within the limits imposed by the terms of our national strategy and the present level
        of our covert capabilities it is possible to advance certain general criteria for operations
        under 10/5, to test broad fields of possible covert action against these criteria, and from
        a combination of the two to give more precise form to the psychological operations which
        should be prosecuted in accordance with the interim strategic concept, and to provide an
        indication of priorities. Overt propaganda should give appropriate support in accordance
        with priorities as may be determined.</item>
       <label>11.</label>
       <item>The general criteria which present covert operations under the interim strategic
        concept should meet are those of effectiveness, feasibility, acceptable risk, and
        flexibility. <list>
         <label>a.</label>
         <item><hi rend="italic">Effectiveness:</hi> The importance of the effects which successful
          operations may be calculated to have in reducing Soviet influence and power or in
          strengthening the free world against the exertion of Soviet influence and power must be
          appreciable and must warrant the effort, cost and risk of the operation. In general,
          priorities should be proportional to anticipated effectiveness.</item>
         <label>b.</label>
         <item><hi rend="italic">Feasibility:</hi> Our capabilities in terms of trained manpower or
          material, and local or international support, must be adequate to give reasonable promise
          of success to the operation in the face of such capabilities as the Communists may have to
          frustrate it.</item>
         <pb n="378" xml:id="pg_378" facs="0407"/>
         <label>c.</label>
         <item><hi rend="italic">Acceptable risk:</hi> The degree to which the undertaking or
          successful conclusion of the operations may be calculated to provoke military reaction
          from the Communists must be sufficiently limited as to be an acceptable risk in terms of
          our national strategy.</item>
         <label>d.</label>
         <item><hi rend="italic">Flexibility:</hi> Operations should be of a type which lend
          themselves within reasonable limits to adaptation or modification to exploit such
          opportunities or undertake such objectives as may become possible or advisable subsequent
          to actual initiation of the operation.</item>
        </list></item>
       <label>12.</label>
       <item>There is a wide range of activity currently in process to bring about the retraction of
        Soviet power and influence which should continue. Many of these activities, although in
        themselves incapable of producing clear and incontrovertible gains, are of great value in
        supporting overt policies which can be expected to be effective. Omission from the following
        discussion of many existing projects, does not imply that they are not considered of value,
        but rather that the approved projects should continue as presently conceived and planned,
        insofar as they meet the above criteria.</item>
       <label>13.</label>
       <item>Within the field of cold war covert operations, it is considered that greatest emphasis
        should be placed upon the following broad fields of activity, not necessarily in order of
        priority: <list>
         <label>a.</label>
         <item>Weakening of <persName>Kremlin</persName> control over the internal assets of the
          Soviet-controlled bloc, and increasingly occupying the <persName>Kremlin</persName> with
          problems within this area.</item>
         <label>b.</label>
         <item>Direct action to reduce subversive Soviet influence in those areas of the free world
          that are most immediately threatened thereby.</item>
         <label>c.</label>
         <item>Covert manipulation of key elements in unstable countries of the free world to
          increase the stability and utility to the objectives of U.S. foreign policy of those
          countries.</item>
        </list></item>
       <label>14.</label>
       <item>Within these three broad fields of activity, the following categories meet the criteria
        outlined above and should be given greater emphasis than they are currently receiving.
        Detailed studies may reveal that effective action within some of these categories is beyond
        our capabilities. Also, events will undoubtedly indicate the desirability of concentration
        on other lines of effort. This will require continuous review of interim strategic policy. <list>
         <label>a.</label>
         <item><p><hi rend="italic">Disintegration of Communist Parties Outside the Iron
            Curtain</hi>. Communist parties in the free world are principal vehicles for Soviet
           subversion. They are also much more accessible to us than are those within the Iron
           Curtain. By a combination of covert and overt action their effectiveness can be
           appreciably reduced and in some areas totally nullified. Some of the means that can be
           employed are (a) reduction of financial support, (b) penetration and exposure, (c)
           instigation of internal conflicts and dissensions among individuals and groups, (d)
           outlawing of local parties, (e) legal action of all types against individuals and groups,

           geographical position, its detachment from the Soviet orbit may be feasible. The
           principal advantage gained would be its psychological effects both in subjugated
           countries and in areas under intense Soviet pressure, although there would also be useful
           additional by-products of a military nature, especially as regards the position of
           Yugoslavia and Greece. It would be a demonstration that a continuing Soviet advance is
           not inevitable and that a retraction of Soviet power is practically possible. A
           preliminary estimate indicates that detachment could be accomplished by Albanian
           personnel and without the overt participation of Western military forces.</p>
          <p>A detailed plan should be made [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
            declassified</hi>] covering each step in such action up to its successful completion,
           including time phasing and all logistic aspects. Estimates should be made of personnel
           and material requirements, together with plans for meeting them. Detailed appraisal
           should be made of the probable degree of secrecy that could be maintained throughout [<hi
            rend="italic">1½ lines not declassified</hi>]. The extent to which preliminary
           disorganizing of the Albanian economy would contribute to the success of the operation
           should be appraised.</p>
          <p>If such studies continue to indicate feasibility, the State Department should
           investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of obtaining the acquiescence or the active
           support of Great Britain as well as Yugoslavia, Greece and Italy, together with the
           practicability of reaching agreements on political objectives which would preclude such
           future difficulties as efforts at domination by these neighboring countries. The
           necessity of recognition of such a revolutionary government should be appraised, and the
           necessity, feasibility and timing of overt economic and logistic assistance, together
           with its amount and cost.</p></item>

            System</hi>.</p>
          <p>The inherent suspicion and lack of mutual trust and confidence within the communist
           system and our own experience in exploiting them gives grounds for belief that we would
           be able to increase this suspicion far beyond what we have hitherto accomplished, to the
           point <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0409"/>of systematic removal or elimination of
           personnel in important and effective positions. The communist reservoir of able and
           experienced personnel is not unlimited, and individuals of demonstrated power and
           effectiveness would be excellent targets. Many techniques are available to apply to these
           ends, but our access to and knowledge of conditions within the satellites indicate that
           the best chances of success would be obtained by breeding distrust among satellite
           personnel and between those individuals and Moscow, although such efforts within the
           Soviet Union should be included to the maximum of our capabilities. It should be noted
           that this category involves a narrower objective than broad attempts to disrupt the
           system by a variety of means other than marking individuals for suspicion and distrust.
           It has a definite relationship to and should be correlated with the defective

        war but also that of planning for covert operations in time of war in collaboration with the
        Joint Chiefs of Staff. It is essential to establish logistical support for hot war plans
        prior to D-Day. Rather than create separate parallel lines of supply for similar materiels
        with the military services, it is desired to continue in collaboration with the Department
        of Defense in the establishment of support installations, to be used not only for hot war
        requirements but also for <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>’s cold war support. Further,

      <p>On October 31 you formally advised this office of certain observations in connection with
       National Security Council Intelligence Directive No. 9 (<gloss target="#t_NSCID1"
        >NSCID</gloss> 9) as revised on October 24,<note n="2" xml:id="d141fn2">See <ref
         target="#d132">Document 132</ref>. <persName corresp="#p_HH1">Hoover</persName>’s comments
        have not been found.</note> and you requested that they be brought to the attention of the
       appropriate members of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>. Those observations were, in
       effect, as follows: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>The Attorney General, as Chief Legal Officer of the Government, should be a member of
         the Special Committee of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> whenever matters of
         interest to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (<gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss>) are
         before that Committee; and it should be made explicit that the <gloss target="#t_FBI1"
          >FBI</gloss> is to assist the Attorney General and the Special Committee when such matters
         are before the Committee.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>The right granted to the United States Communications Intelligence Board (<gloss
          target="#t_USCIB1">USCIB</gloss>) “to investigate and study the standards and practices of
         its member agencies and departments in utilizing and protecting <gloss target="#t_COMINT1"
          >COMINT</gloss> (communications intelligence) information” is too broad and may lead to
         abuse.</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>The authority granted to the Director, <gloss target="#t_NSA1">NSA</gloss> “to have
         direct access to … any elements of the … civilian <gloss target="#t_COMINT1">COMINT</gloss>
         agencies on any matters of operational and technical control as may be necessary” also is
         too broad, as is the Director’s authority “to obtain such information and intelligence
         material from (those agencies) as he may require.”</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>With reference to the first point above, I am informed that it was the understanding when
       the Directive was drafted, that the Attorney General, under the established procedures of the
        <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>, would be a member of the Special Committee whenever
       matters of interest to the <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> were before that Committee;
       and that in such instances, the Attorney General could, as a matter of course, have the
       assistance of the Bureau. That understanding has been confirmed by the President when, in
       approving this Directive, he directed that this procedure is to be followed. <gloss
        target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss> 9 will be revised accordingly regarding the membership of
       the Special Committee.</p>
      <p>In connection with your second and third points, the Secretaries of State and Defense
       acting as the Special Committee of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> for <pb n="385"
        xml:id="pg_385" facs="0414"/><gloss target="#t_COMINT1">COMINT</gloss> with the assistance
       of the Director of Central Intelligence, have directed me to advise you as follows.</p>
      <p>It is understood that your concern regarding these latter two points is that they might
       result in encroachment upon or interference with the unique responsibilities of the <gloss
        target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> in the internal security field and that, consequently, you
       desire that the <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> be granted explicit exemption from those
       portions of the Directive.</p>
      <p>With specific reference to your second point, paragraph 1f of the Directive states that the
       Board’s authority in the matter under discussion shall be binding only if it is adopted by
       the unanimous vote of the members of the Board. Furthermore, this paragraph prescribes that
       any recommendation of this sort approved by a majority, but not all, of the members of the
       Board shall automatically be transmitted by the Board to the Special Committee. No such
       action of the Board therefore can be binding on you unless you agree to it and, in the event
       of disagreement, the matter would be considered by the Special Committee, augmented by the
       Attorney General, as a matter of course and not as a matter of formal appeal on your
       part.</p>
      <p>With specific reference to your third point, above, paragraph 2f of the Directive
       recognizes that elements of the Armed Forces and other agencies will require close <gloss
        target="#t_COMINT1">COMINT</gloss> support and that necessary direct operational control of
       specified <gloss target="#t_COMINT1">COMINT</gloss> facilities and resources will be
       delegated by the Director to the chiefs of other agencies. The types of operations
       contemplated by the <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> undoubtedly would fall within the
       meaning of a close support requirement for the accomplishment of your mission, in which case
       it would be possible for you to arrange with the Director, <gloss target="#t_NSA1"
        >NSA</gloss>, for the assignment to your Bureau of such facilities as are needed for this
       requirement.</p>
      <p>In connection with the authority granted to the Director, <gloss target="#t_NSA1"
        >NSA</gloss>, to have direct access to any elements of civilian <gloss target="#t_COMINT1"
        >COMINT</gloss> agencies and to obtain information and intelligence material from those
       agencies, such access is always established through mutually prescribed channels. However,
       the vital element of security would be eliminated if normal channels of interdepartmental
       exchange were prescribed for the conduct of <gloss target="#t_COMINT1">COMINT</gloss>
       business. On the other hand, all members of the Board would be handicapped severely if they
       could not participate laterally in all phases of the <gloss target="#t_COMINT1"
        >COMINT</gloss> operation through mutually acceptable channels.</p>
      <p>With reference to your reservation regarding the allocation of votes in <gloss
        target="#t_USCIB1">USCIB</gloss>, which was raised orally by your representatives in
       addition to the points made in your letter, this device was only designed as an
       administrative mechanism to provide a reasonable dividing line between civilian and
       non-civilian issues if such were to arise. In view of your reservation, however, the Special
       Committee has decided that the <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0415"/><gloss
        target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> representative should cast two votes at Board meetings—as is
       provided for the representative of the Secretary of State and the Director of Central
       Intelligence—and that the representative of the Secretary of Defense should also cast two
       votes. This would equalize your voting strength with that of the other civilian members and
       still provide the possible advantage of the reasonable dividing line. <gloss
        target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss> 9 will be amended accordingly.</p>
      <p>It may be pertinent in conclusion to review the reasons for the existence of <gloss
        target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss> 9. That Directive was issued for the following reasons: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>To set forth with exactitude the fundamental principle that the <gloss
          target="#t_COMINT1">COMINT</gloss> activities of the U.S. are a national responsibility
         rather than a matter of primary interest to any one of the departments or agencies
         concerned.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>To delineate clearly the broad lines of policy which will govern this mutual
         assumption of responsibility.</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>To reconstitute <gloss target="#t_USCIB1">USCIB</gloss> in a manner which will assure
         an orderly, precise, secure and effective complex of <gloss target="#t_COMINT1"
          >COMINT</gloss> activities.</item>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item>To set up the most rapid and equitable system which not only would give full
         protection to the individual agencies and departments on the Board but also would provide
         final adjudication, as needed, by the Chief Executive.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>The Directive, amended as indicated above, would appear to accomplish the foregoing as
       regards all agencies participating in <gloss target="#t_COMINT1">COMINT</gloss> activities.
       On the other hand, excepting the <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> from adherence to
       portions of the Directive would weaken the Directive to a point where it would have little
       meaning or value because the fundamental principle of its creation would have been destroyed.
       Since <gloss target="#t_COMINT1">COMINT</gloss> must be set apart from the normal operations
       of Government and a special mechanism created to handle <gloss target="#t_COMINT1"
        >COMINT</gloss> activities, those activities must be coordinated by the bodies which have
       been created to handle them—namely, the Special Committee and <gloss target="#t_USCIB1"
        >USCIB</gloss>—on a basis of mutual responsibility with equitable representation of all
       interested departments and agencies.</p>
      <p>In summary, however, nothing in the directive should be construed to encroach upon or
       interfere with the unique responsibilities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the
       field of internal security. This will be made explicit by adding a paragraph to this effect
       in <gloss target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss> 9.</p>

       The following facts and assumptions emerged:</p>
      <p>[<hi rend="italic">6 paragraphs (18½ lines) not declassified</hi>]</p>
      <p>I need not point out that this affair represents an appalling setback [<hi rend="italic"
        >less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] the U.S. Government. There may be political
       repercussions which might make it exceedingly difficult or impossible for our diplomatic
       mission to maintain itself in Warsaw. Another telegram in from our Embassy on December 27
       pointed out that the Polish Foreign Office had advised the Embassy that only American Embassy
       officers on the diplomatic list would be immune from Polish jurisdiction, including the
       provisions of the Polish legislation on espionage activity.<note n="4" xml:id="d142fn4">Not

       in on the American Embassy in the same pattern that has been established in other Eastern
       Satellite capitals. <gloss target="#t_EE1">EE</gloss> is watching this entire situation
       closely, and I have arranged <pb n="388" xml:id="pg_388" facs="0417"/>for [<hi rend="italic"

       information received from abroad [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
       declassified</hi>].</p>
      <p>[<hi rend="italic">3½ lines not declassified</hi>] You will recall that the Korean war was
       already three or four months old, and that there was a very strong feeling within the
       Military Establishment that the Korean war, as an act of overt Communist military aggression,
       probably represented the opening stage of Soviet aggression involving real danger of an
       all-out conflict. Late in 1950 and early in 1951 the Military Establishment became intensely
       interested in the concept of “retardation”. This concept meant that everything possible
       should be done [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] to develop
       resistance mechanisms within the Eastern European Satellite area which might be activated and
       heavily re-supplied in the event of war. The objective was to develop large-scale guerrilla
       warfare and sabotage forces behind the Soviet lines. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
        declassified</hi>] heavy pressure by our Military Establishment to accelerate these
       activities.</p>
      <p>You will recall that early in 1951 <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>
       produced his so-called Scope, Pace and Magnitude Paper, and there was consideration by the
        <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>’s
        mission.<note n="5" xml:id="d142fn5">Reference is to <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1"
         >Smith</persName>’s paper (see <ref target="#d68">Document 68</ref>) which was the basis of
         <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/5 (<ref target="#d90">Document 90</ref>).</note>
       More than anything else, this U.S. Military requirement for retardation on a vast scale
       impelled <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> to have the <gloss
        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> re-affirm his charter, particularly as related to the vastly
       expensive activities in connection with the development of retardation.</p>
      <p>During this period almost two years ago, both the State Department, the <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and notably <persName corresp="#p_MBGJUSA1">General
        Magruder</persName> were convinced that the Psychological Warfare Division (General
        <persName>McClure</persName>) in the Department of the Army as well as other senior officers
       in the Army and Air Force were engaging in a very great deal of wishful thinking as to what
       could be done by clandestine means in Eastern Europe to develop resistance mechanisms capable
       of producing a massive retardation contribution. This thinking within the Military resulted
       from, in my opinion, almost complete ignorance of Eastern Europe and what a highly developed
       totalitarian police state could accomplish in the way of snuffing out anything remotely
       related to so-called resistance organizations. Nevertheless, the <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_MBGJUSA1">General Magruder</persName> and I did not feel
       that we could block what the Army desired to see accomplished in this field. We could only,
       and we did what we could, endeavor to educate the Army to the realities of life in an Eastern

       representatives naturally could not oppose covert activities, the objectives of which related
       to the national security and were designed to contribute to the military effort of the
       Western Allies in resisting Soviet attack on Western Europe. As stated above, <persName
        corresp="#p_MBGJUSA1">General Magruder</persName> and I, as well as <persName
        corresp="#p_BBGJD1">General Balmer</persName>, the Joint Chiefs of Staff representative as a
       consultant to <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>,
       could only point out the extreme difficulties of accomplishing anything and endeavor to
       persuade the Military that their Planners should not, repeat not, in the development of
       strategic plans, count on a resistance potential behind the enemy lines in the first stages
       of an all-out war.</p>
      <p>In the meeting [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] yesterday both
        <persName corresp="#p_MBGJUSA1">General Magruder</persName> and <persName
        corresp="#p_BBGJD1">General Balmer</persName> stated that there still exists in the
       Department of the Army a highly optimistic appreciation of what can be done in the way of
       guerrilla activity in time of war based on resistance mechanisms developed in times of peace.
        <persName corresp="#p_MBGJUSA1">General Magruder</persName> recalled that recently in a
       briefing General <persName>Collins</persName> himself had referred to the destruction by
       resistance elements of bridges behind the enemy lines in Eastern Europe in case of war, his
       idea apparently being that such actions present no great difficulties of accomplishment. The
       fact is that large bridges to be destroyed by demolition require charges involving tons and
       tons of explosives which must be carefully and sometimes painfully placed. Needless to say,
       all strategic bridges will be heavily guarded by military detachments in time of war.<note
        n="6" xml:id="d142fn6">A handwritten notation in the margin reads, “and peace!”</note></p>
      <p>The Air Force has also exerted pressure on the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to
       develop escape and evasion capabilities in Eastern Europe in time of war. The Air Force
       interest is, of course, easily explained and quite understandable. The fact remains that the
       setting up of escape and evasion routes, safe houses and recruiting of native personnel in
       peace time is an infinitely complicated, dangerous and time-consuming process.</p>
      <p>Prior to the meeting in Paris early in March, 1952 of the Eastern European Chiefs of
       Mission, I addressed a memorandum on February 1, 1952 to Messrs.
        <persName>Bonbright</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BW1">Barbour</persName> and
        <persName>Campbell</persName>,<note n="7" xml:id="d142fn7">Not found.</note> which contains
       the following paragraphs: <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“A general explanation might be given to the chiefs of mission alone, as to the aspects
         of so-called positive political action within the Soviet orbit, i.e., plans and
         preparations which are designed to lay the groundwork for massive internal resistance in
         case of war. In the light of these considerations, do the chiefs of mission consider that
         the risks involved should and must be taken?</p>
        <pb n="390" xml:id="pg_390" facs="0419"/>
        <p>“What suggestions have the chiefs of mission for the timing, phasing, scope and pace of
         positive political action by covert means behind the Iron Curtain? This question might be
         dealt with country by country and individually with the several chiefs of mission.</p>
        <p>“It seems to me that these questions lie close to the heart of our strategy for the cold
         war for the next few years. I believe that our representatives on the spot not only could
         contribute a great deal which would be helpful in Washington but also that they should be
         aware of current plans and activities in the countries to which they are assigned.”</p>
       </quote></p>
      <p>The Record of Discussions of the meeting in Paris contains the following paragraph under
       “Conclusions and Recommendations”:<note n="8" xml:id="d142fn8">Not found.</note>
       <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“II. 3. <hi rend="italic">Covert Operations</hi>. Such operations are a necessary part of
         the total effort aimed at weakening the Soviet grip on the satellites. They should be aimed
         not only at securing a maximum of intelligence but also at breaking down the Soviet system
         of control and <hi rend="italic">building organizations for future action</hi>. It must be
         recognized, however, that operations of this character may endanger the continued
         functioning of our diplomatic missions in the countries concerned.”</p>
       </quote></p>
      <p>The point of the foregoing is to illustrate that all of the Chiefs of Mission present at
       the Paris meeting agreed that in the national interest it was necessary for the <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to do what it could to develop covert mechanisms within the
       Eastern European satellite countries. With respect to Poland, I talked in Paris individually
       with Ambassador <persName>Flack</persName>. He referred to the fact that the United States
       had more friends to the square inch in Poland than perhaps in any other satellite country and
       mentioned the five million Poles in the United States. He did point out, however, that the
       Sovietization of Poland had moved forward rapidly and that Poland had now become an efficient
       Police State with informers everywhere and with Soviet officials in all key points of the
       government, particularly in the US. In other words, in spite of the extreme difficulties and
       risk, <persName>Flack</persName>’s own judgment was that it might be possible to do something
       in Poland, and in any event the attempt should be made.</p>
      <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (11½ lines) not declassified</hi>]</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_BBGJD1">General Balmer</persName> of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
       attended the meetings with the British and was provided with a copy of the agreed minutes. He
       has advised me that the somewhat pessimistic evaluation of capabilities for clandestine
       activities in Eastern Europe which came out of these meetings with the British was very
       useful indeed in counteracting some of the far too optimistic ideas existing within the
       Departments of the Army and the Air Force.</p>
      <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0420"/>
      <p>The Military Establishment for obvious strategic reasons was primarily interested in Poland
       insofar as retardation and escape and evasion were concerned. In addition, opportunities
       within Poland were regarded as much greater than in the other satellites, with the possible
       exception of Albania. The Poles historically hate and fear the Russians. The Poles have
       perhaps the strongest feeling of nationalism in Eastern Europe and a long tradition of
       conspiratorial and underground activity. [<hi rend="italic">3 lines not declassified</hi>] To
       sum up, the situation was about as follows: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>Pressure on the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> by our Military Establishment to

          line not declassified</hi>].</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>The end result was as set forth in the first part of this memorandum. In other words, the
       efforts in Poland resulted in an extremely important set back which might have serious
       repercussions on the operations of our Embassy in Warsaw. In addition, the Polish UB has
       obtained information on the techniques and objectives of American clandestine activities. The
       Warsaw Government has made extremely clever and probably most effective propaganda use out of
       this fiasco. (See <gloss target="#t_FBIS1">FBIS</gloss> Report No. 252–1952)</p>

      <p rend="center">NATIONAL PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFORT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 1952</p>
      <p rend="center">[Omitted here is Section I, “Purpose and Framework.”]</p>
      <p rend="center">II. Summary of Significant Psychological Activities</p>
      <p>1. The Board presents below a brief evaluative summary of the status of our national
       psychological programs as of December 31, 1952, based on the appended Progress Reports of
       recent significant activities by the departments and agencies responsible for psychological
       operations.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">General Comments</hi></p>
      <p>2. U.S. capabilities for psychological action, within the limits of the world power
       position, are slowly but steadily improving, but they remain inadequate for taking
       immediately effective psychological action contributing to a retraction of the
        <persName>Kremlin</persName>’s power and influence.</p>
      <pb n="393" xml:id="pg_393" facs="0422"/>
      <p>3. Progress has been made in planning and coordinating interdepartmental and inter-agency
       action, in making use of indigenous resources for “gray” or unattributed operations, in
       building up potentialities for increased “black” or covert activity, and in expanding under
       existing programs technical facilities for radio broadcasting.</p>
      <p>4. Our national psychological effort is at greatest disadvantage in the <gloss
        target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Communist China. In these areas, radio broadcasting
       remains almost the only weapon we are now employing on any significant scale. Even here,
       Russian jamming presents a very serious problem, although evidence continues to appear that
       broadcasts are heard by a limited audience on whom they have some effect. In Communist China
       listening facilities for the masses are severely limited.</p>
      <p>5. In the Soviet satellite states of Eastern Europe also, radio broadcasting constitutes
       the major active element at our disposal. In these countries, too, jamming constitutes an
       obstacle, although at present a less serious one, perhaps, than in the <gloss
        target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. In the case of some of the satellites, however, some
       progress has been made in building up other capabilities for psychological activities.</p>
      <p>6. More positive psychological action directed against the Soviet orbit necessarily awaits
       a greater development of our over-all capabilities, and an accompanying adjustment of our
       basic national policy. In the present interim position, until a more aggressive strategic
       concept becomes feasible, psychological planning and programming against the orbit has gone
       ahead on the basis of doing everything possible to aggravate its internal conflicts in the
       hope that this will subsequently help to bring about a retraction of
        <persName>Kremlin</persName> control and influence.</p>
      <p>7. U.S. psychological programs outside the Iron Curtain, where the major portion of the
       national psychological effort has been applied, have moved with moderate success toward the
       achievement of our objectives in certain areas. The psychological impact of American aid
       programs has, despite some difficulties, in most respects been favorable. With regard to the
       psychological problems arising from the large numbers of American personnel abroad,
       considerable progress has been made in respect to U.S. troops. Some progress is recorded
       toward meeting the “neutralist” menace. The US–UN stand against forcible repatriation of
       Korean prisoners of war has gained general acceptance with good psychological effect. There
       is closer and more effective cooperation between the various agencies carrying out American
       psychological programs abroad, and steadily increasing recognition of the role of
       psychological operations in world affairs.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Related Activities</hi></p>
      <p>8. Certain related activities are covered in a specially classified section of this report,
       Annex C.</p>
      <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0423"/>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Area Summary</hi></p>
      <p>9. In <hi rend="italic">Western Europe</hi> there have been set-backs, such as the delay in
       ratification of the European Defense Community accords and the decision of the European
       member governments to cut their defense contributions under <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
        >NATO</gloss>. But the over-all picture contains bright elements as well. The reports of all
        <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> reporting agencies indicate that, as 1952 ends,
       communism is on a slow but definitely perceptible decline (with the possible exception of
       Italy). Furthermore, there is agreement that U.S. psychological programs have made an
       effective if modest contribution to this decline. Communism remains the major long-term
       threat, of course; but other forces tending to disrupt free world solidarity, and other forms
       of anti-Americanism, such as “neutralism,” constitute more immediate problems.</p>
      <p>10. In the <hi rend="italic">Middle East</hi> the picture is not so bright. Iran is an
       obvious danger spot and a classic example of the difficulties and potential dangers
       confronting the continued existence of freedom in countries where extreme nationalism exists
       as a major problem in itself, and one that is aggravated and complicated by the fact that it
       can be easily inflamed and exploited by communism. Tension arising from some of the same
       elements that are found in Iran is growing in Iraq. In both these cases, as in the other Arab
       countries of the area, it can not be confidently asserted that there has been progress in the
       psychological field. In <hi rend="italic">North Africa</hi>, nationalist ferment presents
       increasingly complex problems of a psychological character, rendered more acute by the
       presence of important American air bases within the area.</p>
      <p>11. This does not mean, however, that the picture in the Middle East is entirely dark.
       Favorable effects continue from such psychological initiatives as the Mecca airlift, and the
       visit of the Fleet to the area. Our economic and military aid programs, and their active
       psychological exploitation, have produced good results, particularly in <hi rend="italic"
        >Turkey</hi>, which represents an encouragingly stable and friendly factor.</p>
      <p>12. In <hi rend="italic">South and Southeast Asia</hi>, all the problems and potential
       dangers in the situation are still present; but from the reports emerges the impression that
       gradually U.S. capabilities for holding our own in the psychological struggle there are being
       improved. Both on the overt information side and in non-attributable activities significant
       gains have been registered, particularly in the Philippines, Indo-China, and Thailand. In the
        <hi rend="italic">Indian sub-Continent</hi> too, slow progress continues. Wise exploitation
       of the psychological possibilities of our aid programs, the agreement to extend military aid
       to Pakistan, and U.S. acceptance in the UN of the Indian Resolution on Korea—subsequently
       rejected out of hand by the Soviet bloc—have all had a favorable effect.</p>
      <p>13. In the <hi rend="italic">Far East</hi>, psychological activities are steadily if slowly
       expanding. A psychological plan to deal with the problems raised by the <pb n="395"
        xml:id="pg_395" facs="0424"/>presence of U.S. troops in <hi rend="italic">Japan</hi> is now
       being prepared. Better use is being made of Japanese indigenous organizations and other
       resources in combatting communism. New psychological activities under the Far East Command
       include moves to build up escape operations in <hi rend="italic">Korea</hi> and strengthen
       and improve the organization responsible for unconventional warfare. A number of
       psychological programs designed to take advantage of the proximity of U.S. and communist
       forces in Korea have been undertaken. Efforts to penetrate <hi rend="italic">Red China</hi>
       were being slowly developed, with a significant increase in leaflet dropping, radio
       broadcasting, and some other activities of a non-attributable nature.</p>
      <p>14. In <hi rend="italic">Latin America</hi>, likewise, the spread of communism and the
       growing threat of Peronism have led us to increase our capabilities for combatting these and
       other anti-American forces. Overt information efforts are combining with TCA aid programs and
       non-attributable activities on an increasing scale. It is evident from current reports,
       however, that more will be required before we can take care of the dual Communist-Peronista
       threat to hemisphere unity.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Special Problems</hi></p>
      <p>15. Coordinated efforts of all the departments and agencies concerned had, by the year’s
       end, been undertaken to minimize the impact of the communist germ warfare charges. Similarly,
       the Soviet “Hate America” campaign, as well as the so-called Campaign of Peace, seem to be
       declining in effectiveness outside the Iron Curtain, thanks, in part at least, to persistent
       and better-coordinated U.S. efforts to counteract them. The long-term implications of these
       campaigns remain serious, however. There are manifest indications of the effectiveness of the
       “Hate America” campaign inside the Iron Curtain countries, and the need for more effective
       counter measures continues great.</p>
      <p>16. Major psychological problems continue to be raised by our commercial and immigration
       policies. The repercussions of our trade and tariff restrictions tend in some countries to
       diminish the psychological effects of our economic aid programs. The restrictions on
       immigration and the complications of our visa policy continue to offset some of the best
       efforts of our psychological operations.</p>
      <p>17. Quietly effective use appears to have been made of the psychological possibilities
       inherent in our development of novel atomic and other weapons.</p>

       <p rend="center">RESEARCH AND INTELLIGENCE FOR ECONOMIC DEFENSE</p>
       <p>There are two principal tasks of the intelligence and research underlying the operations
        and policy formulation of economic defense. <pb n="397" xml:id="pg_397" facs="0426"/>One is
        the task of appraising the overall relative economic capabilities and vulnerabilities of the
        Soviet bloc and the West in terms of economic defense measures and programs; this is a long
        range problem of large dimensions. The other task is that of keeping close and continuous
        touch with current East-West trade patterns and practices and economic developments within
        the Soviet bloc and the West; this is essential to provide the basic facts on specific
        relative vulnerabilities for purposes of current economic defense operations and
        negotiations.</p>
       <p>The drafts prepared in connection with the proposed National Intelligence Estimate (<gloss
         target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>) 59 represent a systematic attempt to appraise the relative
        overall vulnerabilities of the Free World and the Soviet bloc. It is clear, however, that
        the materials available for any accurate appraisal of specific Soviet bloc vulnerabilities
        are still meager. Furthermore, the analysis of such materials is still in a very early stage
        of development, and much more work is needed in this important area. Meanwhile, the demands
        for basic trade analysis and other data needed for day-to-day operations continue to be
        insistent and continue on the increase. The problem is to plan the work for both the
        short-run or current operating and policy needs and the broader, longer run needs so as to
        achieve the maximum benefit for the East-West trade program.</p>
       <p>The progress made in recent months in the fields of shipping and foreign trade
        intelligence for economic defense backstopping is summarized below.</p>
       <p>There has been a notable increase in attention given to shipping intelligence, and a
        number of papers on this subject have been prepared; considerable work remains to be done,
        however. Included in this effort has been the joint development with the British of an
        agreed intelligence estimate of the facts concerning trade with Communist China, including
        the volume of trade and the number and capacity of vessels engaged in the trade.</p>
       <p>A second area in which progress has been made in the past several months is the
        preparation of commodity studies of strategic items entering into East-West trade. In
        connection with the work of the OIT technical task groups, (see <hi rend="italic">Title II
         Activities</hi> in body of report) <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and the Department
        of State prepared, and Intelligence Advisory Committee (<gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss>)
        agencies have to some extent reviewed, commodity analyses of a number of International List
        II and III items. A few of these studies, on lead, pyrites, electrical machinery, marine
        boilers and tires and tubes, represented comprehensive analyses. An intensive study of
        rubber has also been in progress. A great many others, although not comprehensive,
        represented very considerable efforts in the utilization of available data. The work was
        extensive and, though not exhaustive because of the time element and competing priorities,
        represents an important step forward. It is hoped that by the end of 1953 comprehensive
        analyses will be available on the requirements, production, and <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398"
         facs="0427"/>trade of the Soviet bloc in each of the major items considered to be of
        important strategic value to the bloc, particularly those items subject to less-than-embargo
        control.</p>
       <p>The companion project to the commodity studies was initiated early in 1952, and is a
        series of country-by-country studies analyzing the trade relations between the principal
        Western European countries and the important Soviet bloc countries with which they trade.
        Work on these analyses has only begun. The analyses are needed in policy planning on
        “decreasing reliance” and in implementing the Battle Act, and are aimed at affording policy
        officers a better factual background in gauging the bargaining positions of the individual
        countries trading with the Soviet bloc. The analyses would also serve to uncover prospective
        difficulties before they have come to a head. Given more time, it is sometimes possible to
        avoid the shipment of strategic goods by a Western country without prejudicing its economic
        and political position. This intelligence need in the trade field was stressed in the fourth
        progress report on <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 104/2.<note n="8" xml:id="d144fn8"
         >Not printed. (National Archives, RG 59, S/S–<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Files: Lot
         63 D 351, <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> Files, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
         104, Memoranda 1952–53, Box 61)</note></p>
       <p>To date, two comprehensive bilateral trade studies have been prepared, and three others
        are in process. These studies involve considerable expenditure of man-hours, but the results
        justify more work in this field.</p>
       <p>In addition to the above analyses, The Department of Commerce has been pursuing two
        projects in the compilation of trade statistics, in accordance with interdepartmental
        arrangements made early in 1952. One is the compilation, from published and supplementary
        trade material, of the trade of each of the significant Free World countries with the Soviet
        bloc, by country and commodity. Useful reference tables have been issued quarterly on many
        of these countries and, on others, less frequently. The second part of the project is the
        collation of classified data which the individual COCOM countries submit monthly on their
        exports (or licenses granted for export) to the Soviet bloc of items included in the
        International Lists. The Department of Commerce summaries provide data from which the trends
        and pattern of this trade can be more readily discerned in certain cases and from which
        answers to specific commodity or country problems can be developed with much less effort
        than was formerly required in dealing with the individual monthly reports. This work, which
        marks an important initial step in the development of the needed statistical base, is being
        reviewed in an interagency committee.</p>
       <p>The Intelligence Working Group (IWG) established under EDAC–<gloss target="#t_IAC1"
         >IAC</gloss> sponsorship was quite active in the second half of 1952. <pb n="399"
         xml:id="pg_399" facs="0428"/>The IWG has provided closer working relationships between the
        intelligence agencies, on one hand, and the policy and operating sections, on the other,
        with the latter able to indicate directly their needs and to assist in providing necessary
        background for the work they initiate. Although there is inevitably room for considerable
        improvement in the treatment of specific problems, the IWG is improving intelligence support
        of economic defense policy and operations. One of its most significant current projects is
        the establishment of a unit which will collate the extensive data now being received on
        Soviet bloc procurement efforts, particularly those efforts which involve evasions of
        Western economic security controls. The details of the project are not yet fully worked out,
        but it has been approved in principle.</p>
       <p>In conclusion, there should be mentioned the general problem of disseminating National
        Intelligence to foreign Governments and international bodies. One difficulty which has
        impeded United States negotiations on economic defense matters could be eliminated by
        establishing a better procedure so that our negotiators might use the material contained in
        intelligence documents to maximum advantage. Such use of intelligence is inhibited by the
        pervasive difficulty of ensuring that security is maintained in the course of using such
        material. This problem should be explored to determine whether amendments to pertinent
         <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> directives and other regulations would be
        desirable.</p>

      <p>There is forwarded to you herewith two memoranda, both dated yesterday, on the general
       subject of the secret intelligence activities and the covert operations abroad of the <gloss

       by <persName>Outerbridge Horsey</persName> and prepared by all of us in this Office
        (<persName>Horsey</persName>, <persName>Berry</persName>, <persName>Strong</persName>,

      <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0429"/>
      <p>The basic purpose of these memoranda is to raise fundamental problems with regard to the
        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> operation abroad and the guidance and control of these
       activities to insure that they shall be closely geared in with our overall strategy and
       political objectives. The memorandum signed by <persName>Horsey</persName> has been shown to
       Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_AWPJ1">Armstrong</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HF1"
        >Howe</persName>, who have indicated to us that they are in general agreement with the
       analysis plus the conclusions and recommendations which flow therefrom. <persName
        corresp="#p_AWPJ1">Armstrong</persName>’s office, of course, has a large interest in the
       subject of the relations between this Department and the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>,
       and I am sure you will want to bring <persName corresp="#p_AWPJ1">Armstrong</persName> and
        <persName corresp="#p_HF1">Howe</persName> into any discussions based on this material.</p>
      <p>The memorandum signed by me I have drafted in a manner and with the idea in mind that it
       might be read and discussed in due course by <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General
        Smith</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen W. Dulles</persName>.<note n="3"

       might be accomplished if you agree with me that it should be. It would also be my suggestion

       <p>There is forwarded to you herewith a memorandum dated January 26, 1953<note n="7"
         xml:id="d145fn7">Printed below.</note> which has been prepared in this office by Messrs.
         <persName>Horsey</persName>, <persName>Berry</persName>, <persName>Strong</persName>,
         <persName>McFadden</persName> and myself. In this connection, I refer to my memorandum
        addressed to you on December 17, 1952 with particular reference to the so-called Kaji case
        in Tokyo as well as to my memorandum addressed to you on December 31, 1952 entitled “<gloss
         target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Activities Directed Against Poland”.<note n="8"
         xml:id="d145fn8">The memorandum on the Kaji case was not found, although documentation on
         the repercussions of the arrest and detection in Japan of Waturu Kaji, a Japanese national,
         by U.S. authorities is in National Archives, RG 59, Central Files, 794.0221. For the
         memorandum on Poland, see <ref target="#d142">Document 142</ref>.</note> In the former
        memorandum I suggested that before my departure I should write a memorandum for you
        embodying certain conclusions I have reached as a result of four years close working
        relationship with <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> of <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss>. The memorandum forwarded to you today endeavors to pose important problems
        which have recently arisen as a result of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> covert
        activities in the field which have caused, are still causing, and will probably continue to
        cause serious embarrassment to the conduct of U.S. foreign relations. In the memorandum
        referred to in the previous sentence, my colleagues and I have endeavored to pose the basic
        questions with regard to Department of State and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
        relationships which we believe the new administration will desire to deal with in the
        immediate future as they relate to the presumed new policy of more “dynamism” with regard to
        the conduct of the cold war.</p>
       <p>The kernel of the problem, as I see it, is that the operations abroad, in the field of
        secret intelligence as well as secret operations, have increasingly tended to be less and
        less geared into what I understand to be the present overall strategy of the United States
        in the management of its foreign relations. Perhaps a better way of stating it would be to
        say that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> covert activities lack sufficient policy
        guidance and control, the inevitable result being that such activities, on occasion, are not
        in the national interest nor do they support our overall policy objectives. The memorandum
        of January 26, 1953 endeavors to meet this problem head on in the hope that <gloss
         target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> activities abroad may be restudied on the National Security
        Council level and perhaps a new look be taken by President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
         >Eisenhower</persName> himself.</p>
       <p>I set forth below certain thoughts and conclusions I have arrived at which might be
        helpful in providing information of a background and historical nature relating to the
        organization, growth and present operations of the Central Intelligence Agency. These
        observations relate primarily to <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> of <gloss

       <p>In the autumn of 1949, <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> of <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
         >CIA</gloss> was a relatively small and compact unit within the framework of but somewhat
        independently situated in the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> organization. It was
        busily preparing to set up mechanisms through which it could engage in so-called
        psychological and political warfare by covert means as defined in <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
         >NSC</gloss> 10/2.<note n="9" xml:id="d145fn9">For <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>

          1945–1950, Emergence of the Intelligence Establishment, Document 292</ref>.</note> In
        September, 1949, the Russians produced their first atomic explosion several years ahead of
        what I understand to be the best calculated estimates. Soviet political warfare on a
        world-wide scale was constantly being stepped up to subvert, divide, weaken and eventually
        control large and important areas of the free world in which the U.S. had a vital stake. On
        June 25, 1950 the North Korean Communists, under Russian control, crossed one of the
        frontiers of the free world by military force. The Communist guerrilla attacks against the
        French and the Vietnamese were assuming the proportions of a major war; Soviet pressure
        against Iran was increasing; Communist guerrilla warfare in Malaya was being stepped up; the
        Chinese Communists were taking over Tibet; the Communists were succeeding in Guatemala,
        etc., etc. <persName>Tito</persName>’s Yugoslavia was under constant menace of a military
        attack by the Soviet satellites of Eastern Europe.</p>
       <p>All of these facts produced within the United States Government and among the American
        people a sense of urgency to prepare for the possibility of additional Communist attacks
        against the free world which might lead to an all out military conflict, including an attack
        against the United States. We started our military build-up on a vast scale during the last
        part of 1950. During this period, both within the government as well as outside, there
        suddenly developed an intense interest in so-called psychological or political warfare. This
        caused considerable pressure to be exerted against <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> of
         <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> immediately to engage in psychological and political
        warfare activities by covert means. At the same time, exceedingly strong pressure was
        exerted upon <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> by
        the Defense Establishment to accomplish in the shortest possible time those responsibilities
        set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2 relating to preparing for resistance
        activities and guerrilla warfare behind the enemy lines in case of war. You will recall that
        during the last part of 1950 powerful elements within the Military Establishment considered
        that perhaps the Russians in 1954 or 1955 would attain a degree of military preparation and
        atomic capability which might lead the leaders in the <persName>Kremlin</persName> either to
        endeavor to obtain their objectives by the use of overt military force on a grand scale, or
        the <persName>Kremlin</persName> would exert the threat of force and subversion to obtain
        control of strategic portions of <pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0432"/>the non-Communist
        world. This would necessarily lead to such reactions upon our part that the danger of an all
        out conflict would indeed be very great. Underlying these considerations, was the
        over-riding fact that China was added to the Communist world and Chinese Communist military
        forces threatened Southeast Asia.</p>
       <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">II. Expansion of <gloss target="#t_OPC1"
         >OPC</gloss></hi></p>
       <p>The objective world situation late in 1950 and early in 1951 (or at least the subjective
        reaction thereto on the part of the Government and the people of the United States) and the
        pressures referred to above led to a vast expansion of <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss>
        of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. The emphasis understandably given by the Military to
        prepare for war and the pressures to organize behind-the-lines resistance, led to constantly
        increasing emphasis within the <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> on preparations for a hot
        war. (In this connection, I refer to my memorandum of December 31, 1952 with regard to [<hi
         rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] activities in Poland.) <gloss
         target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> tended to become more and more of a military and para-military
        planning agency. At the same time, <gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> was endeavoring to
        meet the demands and pressures for increased activity in the field of covert political
        action. I believe that the end result of this situation was that <gloss target="#t_OPC1"
         >OPC</gloss> tried to do too much in too little time with inadequate personnel. I believe
        that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFG1">Frank G. Wisner</persName> would agree with this
        estimate. I may say that qualified personnel in this country for <gloss target="#t_OPC1"
         >OPC</gloss> planning and operations is extraordinarily difficult to come by and difficult
        to train.</p>
       <p>Some unhappy results of this haste inevitably followed:</p>

       <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">III. Learning the Hard Way</hi></p>
       <p>For the reasons stated above, it is my conclusion that these failures of the <gloss
         target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> are not exclusively <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
        failures, but are rather <hi rend="italic">American failures</hi> attributable, to sum up,
        to the following factors: <list>
         <label>1.</label>
         <item>The American characteristic of impatience and “wanting to get the job done”. The
          American belief that if enough money, personnel and effort are applied, everything is
          possible and can be accomplished either instanter or certainly within a year or
          two.</item>
         <label>2.</label>

           number of highly talented, loyal and high caliber Americans. Many of them, however, have
           the characteristics mentioned in paragraph No. 1 above. In the medium levels of <gloss

       <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">V. Conclusions</hi></p>
       <p>The foregoing, I fear, may sound perhaps captiously critical and negative insofar as the
         <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is concerned. I hope that it is not taken in this
        sense. There is a great deal of light in the picture.</p>
       <p>My own feeling is that the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has made remarkable
        progress during the past five years in perhaps the most tricky, sensitive and delicate of
        all governmental operations demanding the highest degree of sophistication and experience.
        It takes many, many years to build up what we may term a covert apparatus. The Russians have
        had thirty-five years experience. We have had five. The only way to learn the intelligence
        business is to engage in it. The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has been actively
        engaging in this business under the enormous pressures referred to in previous sections of
        this memorandum. Glaring mistakes have been made, but solid accomplishments have already
        been achieved. It is my belief that the senior officials of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
         >CIA</gloss> are entirely aware of the deficiencies <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0434"
        />of the organization in its field activities, and remedial action is being taken to tighten
        up and increase security. The training and indoctrination process has been vastly improved
        and men who have shown no talent for the intelligence business have been released.</p>
       <p>The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> organization has made progress in recruiting,
        training and seasoning a group of highly talented men who are coming to consider American
        Intelligence their life career. Amateurism is giving place to an increasing degree of
        professionalism. It is being realized that an intelligence bull is misplaced in the world
        china shop of 1953 and that a cat and later a soft-treading leopard is a more suitable and
        effective animal. I believe that a greater degree of discipline has been established and
        that there is a real understanding growing up within the secret intelligence activities and
        special operations fields that intelligence is not a policy-creating function within the
        Government and can never be. Although there are still some officers within the <gloss
         target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> who have a feeling that intelligence operations abroad are an
        end in themselves and should be conducted independently of and without interference from
        policy-making and implementing American officials. I believe this must and will be corrected
        with time and a greater degree of discipline in government. The U.S. responsibility is such
        that amateurism, free-wheeling and heavy-handedness cannot be permitted in 1953. Our friends
        and allies must have confidence not only in the goodness of our intentions and objectives
        but also in our judgment, discretion and methods. Our dangerous adversaries turn our
        mistakes against us with telling effect, and this does not make for the confidence in our
        leadership which we must have to exercise it effectively in the crucial years to come.</p>
       <p>One more observation: If we comport ourselves in the international arena as though we are
        urgently preparing for a perhaps inevitable conflict with the Soviet world, we add fuel to
        fears and inspire counteraction which increase the danger of just such a conflict. This is a
        most difficult problem—to prepare for war to prevent it—but we must somehow solve it in the
        next few years to come.</p>

       <p>To review <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>–State relationships, in secret intelligence
        and in covert operations, with the double objective (a) of insuring that <hi rend="italic"
         >all</hi>
        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> field activities are of optimum value in the prosecution
        of United States foreign policy objectives and (b) of diminishing the risk of results
        harmful to those objectives.</p>
       <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Discussion:</hi></p>
       <p>Recent integration within <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, at headquarters and in the
        field, of the two main fields, “secret intelligence” and “covert operations,” emphasizes
        their interdependence. Even in the previous state of more or less water-tight separation of
        the two activities, <hi rend="italic">either</hi> might have affected, and indeed did
        affect, the conduct of foreign policy.</p>
       <p>“Secret intelligence” is used herein to describe what <gloss target="#t_NSCID1"
         >NSCID</gloss>–5<note n="14" xml:id="d145fn14"><ref target="#d255">Document
         255</ref>.</note> defines as “all organized federal espionage operations outside the United
        States … for the collection of foreign intelligence information … in connection with the
        national security …” (Counter-espionage is excluded from this discussion) Secret
        intelligence activities are conducted by the Director of Central Intelligence. Moreover, he
        has responsibility for coordinating covert and overt intelligence activities. The senior
        U.S. representative in each country has the responsibility for coordinating <hi
         rend="italic">overt</hi> intelligence collection activities, but there is no recognition in
        theory or in practice of the fact that <hi rend="italic">secret</hi> intelligence activities
        can affect the conduct of foreign policy. By law the Director of Central Intelligence is
        responsible for the protection of intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized
        disclosure. In general this has in practice resulted in the withholding of detailed
        information on secret <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0436"/>intelligence activities in
        both the planning and execution stages. The Department and Chiefs of Mission in the field
        are briefed from time to time on the broad lines of secret intelligence activities in a
        particular country. The positive intelligence information developed by <gloss
         target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is furnished, in some measure and with varying degrees of
        promptness to Chiefs of Mission in the field, and in greater measure and considerably more
        delay to the Department in Washington. Occasionally, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
        will seek policy guidance before or while a particular operation is being conducted, but it
        does not necessarily follow the advice given; nor is it obliged to do so. In general,
        information on intelligence collection operations themselves is not sufficiently specific or
        timely to permit effective policy guidance, even if the Department were required to provide
        such guidance, which it is not.</p>
       <p><gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 50<note n="15" xml:id="d145fn15">See <ref
          target="frus1945-50Intel#d384"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1945–1950,
          Emergence of the Intelligence Establishment, Document 384</ref>.</note> calls for “closer
        liaison” between <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and State and for strengthening the
        “guidance” received by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> from intelligence consumers, but
        the context of these references makes it clear that they relate to the nature of the
        intelligence to be collected and not to the policy implications of the conduct of
        intelligence collection activities. Any operations in a foreign country, however, are bound
        to have implications for the overt conduct of relations with the country concerned. Indeed
        they can have very serious results, leading to the undermining of the stability of a
        friendly government, the loss of public confidence in the U.S. or giving substance to Soviet
        anti-U.S. charges. The judgment as to whether and in what manner a covert proceeding of any
        kind is likely to affect overall objectives in the country concerned is one which in the
        final analysis can be made only by the agency responsible for the conduct of overall
        policy.</p>
       <p>The British meet the problem of political guidance on secret intelligence activities, as
        well as the larger problem of coordinating all other foreign intelligence activities, by
        giving an inter-agency committee, of which the Foreign Office representative is
        automatically Chairman, close policy control over the entire foreign intelligence effort of
        the U.K. The <gloss target="#t_MI1">MI</gloss>–6 man in the field, although he belongs to an
        independent organization whose chief reports directly to the Prime Minister, is given the
        specific responsibility of clearing with the Ambassador when his activities are likely to
        affect the conduct of overt relations. The <gloss target="#t_MI1">MI</gloss>–6 man is able
        to discern the likelihood of political consequences because he is part of a small
        highly-trained professional corps, and because awareness of political factors is an
        essential qualification. A serious failure to do so costs him his job.</p>
       <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0437"/>
       <p>The immense range of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>’s secret intelligence activities,
        the paucity of trained personnel with good political judgment, the extent of our involvement
        in many foreign countries and the serious results of mistakes, would seem to require that
        the authority of the Secretary of State and of the principal U.S. representatives in each
        foreign country be extended in some measure into the “secret intelligence” field. This is
        all the more necessary because of the recent merging of the “secret intelligence” and
        “covert operations” functions within <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. Since the
        necessity of continuous political guidance in the second category is unquestioned, such
        extension of the Department’s authority would seem to be the logical corollary of that
        merging.</p>
       <p>The exclusion of the Department and its representatives in the field from any right to
        full knowledge of what is going on in the intelligence field, and of giving policy guidance
        thereon, has been applied in practice not only to the subject matter of <gloss
         target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss>–5 but also to the preliminary or fact-finding stages of
        “covert operations.” (The latter are defined for the present purpose as activities
        authorized by <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2 and <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
         >NSC</gloss> 10/5.)<note n="16" xml:id="d145fn16">For <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
         10/2, see <ref target="frus1945-50Intel#d292">ibid., Document 292</ref>. For <gloss
          target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/5, see <ref target="#d90">Document 90</ref>.</note> These
        fact-finding operations can, however, have just as serious political consequences, for good
        or for ill, as the actual operations themselves. Moreover, it is hard to draw the dividing
        line in a given case between the “intelligence” phase and the “operations” phase when a
        “project” is submitted through the joint machinery for clearance under paragraph 3(d)(1) of
         <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2. And <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is the
        agency which under the present system draws the dividing line.</p>
       <p>As to “covert operations” themselves, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2 of course
        recognized their intimate relationship to the overt conduct of policy. This relationship was
        emphasized by providing that the Secretary of State should nominate the man initially in
        charge of these operations. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2 said further that
        covert operations should be “planned and conducted in a manner consistent with U.S. foreign
        and military policies and with covert activities” but it left with the Director of Central
        Intelligence the responsibility for insuring that they were so conducted. Committee
        machinery for inter-departmental clearance was established, with the right of appeal to the
         <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> itself in case of serious differences.</p>
       <p>The very nature of covert operations, the necessary use of a separate communications
        system and considerations of security in practice leave the initiative largely in the hands
        of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Headquarters and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
        representatives in the field. Because of lack of knowledge, the policy makers are often
        precluded from giving the necessary guidance. Because many of the questions involved do not
        concern two of the members (<gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and Defense) of the
        Committee of “<gloss target="#t_OPC1">OPC</gloss> Consultants,” because <pb n="409"
         xml:id="pg_409" facs="0438"/>a number of personal relationships between <gloss
         target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and State opposite numbers have grown up, and because it is
        not always used by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, this Committee machinery has not
        been fully effective. In spite of full cooperation at the top levels of <gloss
         target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> on policy coordination in accordance with the letter and
        spirit of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2 there has been a tendency toward
         free-wheeling<note n="17" xml:id="d145fn17">An attached handwritten note reads, “It is
         interesting and pertinent to note that it is current in <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
         to say that the State Dept calls anything ‘free wheeling’ which represents a new
         idea.”</note> at the operating level. There have been a number of failures recently to
        obtain State Department clearance, sometimes the explanation being given that the matter was
        not thought to involve a policy question, sometimes that the responsible officers in the
        State Department could not be reached in time, and at least once with no valid explanation.
        A number of recent experiences underline the necessity of <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
         >CIA</gloss> also recognizing in practice the mandate of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
         >NSC</gloss> 10/2 to clear with State as well as with <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
        and Defense the political implications of projects of a para-military nature. On the other
        hand, there are a number of examples of close and fruitful relations between <gloss
         target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and the State Department. This type of cooperation, as well as
        close relationships which have developed at some posts in the field is, however, largely the
        accidental result of the personalities involved rather than of the system itself. The
        momentum of a large and organizationally independent government organization inevitably
        pulls away from cooperation.</p>
       <p>If covert operations are to be a really effective arm of foreign policy, the policy
        officers of the State Department must, through tightly organized machinery, be brought into
        more intimate relationship with <hi rend="italic">all</hi> stages of covert operations and
        particularly the planning or “intelligence” stages.</p>
       <p>In summary, political guidance by the State Department on “covert operations” is
        increasingly difficult to get across in view of (1) the merging within <gloss
         target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> of responsibility for these operations with that for secret
        intelligence collection; (2) the difficulty in practice of distinguishing between the two
        types of operation and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> freedom from policy guidance on
        the second; (3) the immense range of both types of activity, particularly in view of the
        military pressure to develop resistance and stay-behind organizations; (4) the lack of full
        knowledge on the part of the Department of State of what is going on in both fields until
        and unless <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> chooses to give such information or something
        “blows.”</p>

       <item>The organization and procedures established since October 1950 for the production of
        national intelligence estimates have now been proved in practice. The totality of resources
        of the entire intelligence community is drawn upon to produce national intelligence
        estimates, and they can be improved only as we strengthen these resources. These estimates
        derive authority from the manner of their preparation and from the active participation of
        all the responsible intelligence agency heads in their final review and adoption. Agency
        dissents are recorded where estimates would be watered down by further efforts to secure
        agreement.</item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>A production program for national intelligence estimates has been initiated. It
        provides for a re-examination of existing estimates on critical areas or problems as well as
        the production of new estimates designed to improve the coverage of important topics.
        Special effort is being made to schedule the completion of basic estimates on the <gloss

       <item>Close coordination between planners and policy-makers on the one hand and the

        indicates that the results are beneficial.</item>

        special effort to developing intelligence on China. Surveys of present programs both within
        the Government and in private research are making possible an integrated and maximal use of
        resources. On medium priority areas, such as Iran, Indochina and India, there is
        considerable lag between production of immediate interpretation and analysis of longer term
        factors. On low priority areas, such as Africa and Latin America, such factors receive even
        less study. World Communism, outside the Soviet Orbit, is satisfactorily covered with
        respect to party strength, political maneuverings and relationships to the Moscow propaganda
        lines. Research into matters of organization, financial support and infiltration into
        political and social organizations is inadequate.</item>

      <p>Information on the navies of the Soviet Bloc is, however, in general, satisfactory and
       adequate because of the greater accessibility of naval forces to observation. Coverage on

       <item>Foreign economic intelligence on the free world presents few serious problems, mainly
        those that arise from the wealth of material and multiplicity of sources. For the Soviet
        Bloc, however, such intelligence is far from adequate. Apart from aggregate statistics of
        uncertain reliability published by the Soviet government, the intelligence community is
        confined to exploiting a diminishing flow of low-grade data, much of which is becoming
        increasingly out-of-date. Only by taking advantage of every possible item of information in
        the course of a comprehensive, thoroughly planned, and coordinated study can national
        security needs for knowledge of the Bloc’s economic capabilities and vulnerabilities be met.
        This may mean the subordination of short-term requirements to the long-range program and a
        resolute and imaginative attack on problems of centralized indexing and exploitation of all
        pertinent materials, whether overt or classified. Within the limits of available materials,
        the next twelve months are expected to see the production of individual industry studies of

       the exploitation of the dwindling sources of economic and political information on Communist
       China. Because the interests of the intelligence-producing agencies have become more sharply
       directed toward the Soviet Orbit, the domestic collection effort is increasingly pointed in
       that direction, with particular emphasis on foreign nationality groups within the United
       States, defectors, and other recently arrived aliens.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">7. Foreign Radio Broadcasts</hi></p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">a. Monitoring</hi></p>
      <p>Immediate and extensive coverage of foreign news, information, and propaganda broadcasts is
       provided by a world-wide monitoring network, maintained by <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss> as a service of common concern. A Moscow broadcast can be received in
       Washington in translation or summary within one hour. Coverage of the Soviet Orbit is
       excellent, except for parts of Asia and the Baltic States. Progress made during 1952 towards
       closing these gaps included: the activation of a station at Hokkaido, Japan, to monitor
       northeast Asian broadcasts; negotiations with the British Broadcasting Company for monitoring
       of Baltic and northwestern <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> transmitters by the BBC
       under existing reciprocal arrangements; and a monitoring survey in Pakistan to explore the
       possibilities of covering hitherto unmonitorable Central Asian broadcasts.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">b. Propaganda Analysis</hi></p>
      <p>Propaganda Analysis in support of psychological warfare activities and overt programs such
       as the <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>, has been further improved. Quantitative and
       content analysis of radio propaganda has been supplemented by some analysis of published
       propaganda and press material. More rapid and specialized support on radio propaganda is now
       provided to “watch” groups and estimating offices.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">8. Foreign Materials and Equipment</hi></p>
      <p>The collection and technical analysis of Soviet Orbit products has continued to aid in the
       assessment of <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> scientific, economic, and technological
       capabilities, although the procurement during 1952 of significant items has not come up to
       expectations. Foreign materials and equipment are vital to the factory markings analysis
       program. Owing to the relative stability of the fighting front in Korea, the amount <pb
        n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0449"/>of captured materiel of intelligence importance has
       declined. At present the most productive channels for selective procurement of Soviet
       manufactured items and raw materials are official U.S. missions and covert <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> components overseas. Items procured reasonably successfully
       through such channels during the year included power tools, pharmaceuticals, rubber products,
       and metallurgical samples. Improvement in the coordination, through the Joint Materiel
       Intelligence Agency, of technical analysis requirements and exploitation activities has
       resulted in a greater yield of information from Soviet objects acquired.</p>

       undertook the construction and organization of a monitoring system to obtain information on
       Soviet jamming and related activities in the radio frequency spectrum. A pilot operation
       involving a very limited number of stations is being established. Adequate information as to
       the extent of Soviet jamming, concentration of the jamming stations, and related information
       must await the initiation and implementation of a much-expanded program.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">XIII. Support and Collation Facilities</hi></p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">1. Availability of Materials</hi></p>
      <p>With a few exceptions, all pertinent foreign positive intelligence, both raw and finished,
       is distributed among all interested <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> agencies. In addition
       to the distribution of current material, there is a continuing effort to locate and extract
       pertinent information from the large volume of intelligence material that was collected
       during and after the war, and from other collections in overseas files. The sheer volume of
       these materials presents formidable and as yet unsolved problems. No <gloss target="#t_IAC1"
        >IAC</gloss> agency, utilizing existing techniques, is in a position to record and store all
       this material and to make the information contained therein readily available to analysts
       requiring it. Remedy for this problem is being sought through the refinement of agency
       responsibilities and the development of machine indexing techniques.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">2. Library Facilities</hi></p>
      <p>While the libraries of the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> agencies are not yet
       self-sufficient, they are equipped to satisfy most of the major needs of their users. Their
       utility can be increased and their effectiveness can be improved in connection with current
       plans for improving central reference facilities.</p>
      <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0450"/>
      <p><hi rend="italic">3. Biographic Information</hi></p>
      <p>Each <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> agency maintains files of biographic data on
       foreign personalities for its own particular purposes and makes such data available to the
       other agencies upon request. Excellent data can be made available on political, military, and
       scientific personalities outside the Iron Curtain; coverage within the Soviet Orbit is
       necessarily partial and inadequate. Personalities in the economic and industrial fields are
       poorly covered at present although there is considerable information available. Means of
       improvement are currently being studied. As a result of recent arrangements between the State
       Department and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, the latter is discontinuing biographic
       intelligence in the political, social, and cultural fields and will in the future depend on
       the Department of State for such intelligence.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">4. Photographic Files</hi></p>
      <p>The several Defense agencies and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> each maintain
       photographic and related documentary libraries consistent with their requirements and
       responsibilities. Material in each library is available to the <gloss target="#t_IAC1"
        >IAC</gloss> community. Continuing effort must be exerted to increase the quality and
       quantity of this source of intelligence.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">5. Map Procurement and Reference Services</hi></p>
      <p>[<hi rend="italic">2½ lines not declassified</hi>] Results during the past three years have
       proved the effectiveness of overt collection of maps and related information through the
       Foreign Service Geographic Attaché program. Increased emphasis is being placed on the
       collection of maps and engineering drawings from domestic sources. Service Attaché channels
       are also being used. The currently published foreign maps required for intelligence
       activities are received on a continuing basis through exchange arrangements between the
       Department of State and many foreign official mapping agencies. These exchanges are in
       addition to those of an operational character maintained by the Military Services. Excellent
       map reference services in support of intelligence requirements are maintained by close
       working arrangements between the map libraries.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">6. Foreign Language Publications</hi></p>
      <p>The exploitation of foreign language publications for intelligence purposes is presently
       undertaken in varying degrees by each agency. [<hi rend="italic">2½ lines not
        declassified</hi>] Currently, the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> agencies are
       considering plans with reference to the exploitation of foreign language publications which
       might result in improved coordination in procurement, exploitation, and indexing for
       intelligence purposes.</p>
      <p>Translation is also done by each agency, though coordination is effected to prevent
       duplication. Overseas abstracting from foreign language <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422"
        facs="0451"/>publications is presently performed at a number of diplomatic posts. This work
       is coordinated with similar <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and departmental activities
       in the U.S. to avoid duplication and to make the maximum use of available linguists.</p>
      <p>Most publications needed for the intelligence effort are now being obtained, though major
       gaps exist in regard to Soviet Bloc materials. Through overt and covert channels there is an
       increasing effort to improve procurement in this latter category.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">7. External Research</hi></p>
      <p>External research in the social sciences of particular interest to intelligence has
       presented difficult problems of coordination. In order to improve coordination <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and the Department of State are jointly strengthening the
       latter’s External Research Staff, and the Department of Defense has taken steps to ensure
       necessary coordination of external research contacts on psychological warfare among military
       agencies. It is expected that liaison arrangements between the Department of Defense,
       Department of State, and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> in this field will produce
       substantial progress during the current year in minimizing duplication, ensuring community
       benefit of finished research and facilitate more rational letting of external research
       contracts. Evaluation of this program as it affects the Department of Defense cannot as yet
       be given.</p>
      <p rend="center">No. 8. The Internal Security Program<note n="6" xml:id="d146fn6"
        type="source">Source: National Archives, RG 273, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
        Representative on Internal Security, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 142, Box 46. Top
        Secret; Security Information. Prepared jointly by the Interdepartmental Intelligence
        Conference and the Interdepartmental Committee on Internal Security. An attached statement
        on the objective of the internal security program, consisting of a quotation from <gloss
         target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 142, is not printed.</note></p>
      <p>Recent information regarding the feasibility of hand-portable atomic weapons makes possible
       their clandestine use and thus requires a complete reappraisal, which is underway, of
       virtually the whole internal security program. Action on initial countermeasures, approved by
       the President on December 29, 1952, is being taken by the <gloss target="#t_IIC1"
       >IIC</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_ICIS1">ICIS</gloss>, and the <gloss target="#t_AEC1"
        >AEC</gloss>.</p>
      <p>Domestic counter-intelligence has been improved by a great expansion of informant coverage,
       with emphasis on subversive movements and key industrial facilities. By vigorous prosecution
       of functionaries of the Communist Party, USA under the <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1"
        >Smith</persName> Act, and by action to compel registration of the Party as a Communist
       action organization under the Internal Security Act of 1950, the Party’s National Board has
       been neutralized, its leaders convicted or forced into hiding, Party and bail funds depleted,
       membership reduced appreciably and recruitment drastically hampered. However, such vigorous
       action <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423" facs="0452"/>has also driven the Party further underground
       and made counterintelligence and continued prosecution more difficult. Investigative agencies
       assert the need for more intelligence regarding Soviet and satellite espionage and sabotage
       organizations, additional manpower, and additional funds for military internal security
       programs.</p>
      <p>In the event of war, plans are ready for immediate apprehension of 20,000 dangerous
       civilians. Related programs are being prepared to neutralize dangerous U.S. military
       personnel, enemy aliens and diplomatic personnel. Accordingly, most potentially dangerous
       individuals should be neutralized within the initial period of a Soviet attack.</p>
      <p>Although Executive Order 10290<note n="7" xml:id="d146fn7">For E.O. 10290, see 3 CFR
        1949–53 compilation, pp. 790–797 or 16 FR 9795.</note> on the safeguarding of classified
       security information is in force, an acceptable degree of security for such information will
       not be achieved until satisfactory standards of clearance are established for access to such
       information by government employees and consultants, by non-government personnel in
       classified contract work, and by representatives of foreign governments. <gloss
        target="#t_ICIS1">ICIS</gloss> recommendations on personnel security and access have been
       made but not adopted. (The <gloss target="#t_ICIS1">ICIS</gloss> has not participated in the
       Loyalty program.)</p>
      <p>There is a high degree of installation security for some sensitive government buildings and
       areas, but uniform standards have not yet been generally achieved. Some progress has been
       made in industrial installation security, but protective programs do not include control of
       sub-contracting plants of classified contractors nor essential civilian wartime industrial
       facilities. Legal sanction is lacking to remove security risks in industry and there is
       difficulty in preventing strikes by Communist-infiltrated unions. Plant visitors are
       inadequately identified and checked. Accordingly, it should come as no surprise if acts of
       sabotage occur.</p>
      <p>The port security program, limited to major ports, has not achieved reasonable security as
       regards fire protection and harbor entrance guarding. No effective security program is in
       force for telecommunications.</p>
      <p>Control over the entry of dangerous aliens has not been achieved, largely because of
       personnel limitations in the Coast Guard and the Customs and Immigration Service, lack of
       control over alien crewmen, inadequate surveillance of foreign vessels, and poor control over
       foreign diplomatic and official personnel. The Omnibus Immigration Act, effective December
       24, 1952,<note n="8" xml:id="d146fn8">66 Stat. 163–281.</note> provides authority for
       remedying some inadequacies in entry control. There is little control over illegal entry by
       coastal or plane landings. On departures from the U.S., there are few effective exit controls
       operative, although there is limited screening of <pb n="424" xml:id="pg_424" facs="0453"
       />crewmen under the Magnuson Act. Export and monetary controls present no significant
       problems.</p>
      <p>Arrangements to report unconventional attacks have been made, but countermeasures provide
       little security against clandestine AW, <gloss target="#t_BW1">BW</gloss> and <gloss
        target="#t_CW1">CW</gloss> unconventional attacks.</p>

       <item>In the fall of 1950, you informed this Agency<note n="2" xml:id="d147fn2">This
         communication has not been further identified.</note> that, in anticipation of <gloss
         target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> requirements for support of covert operations, the U.S. Air
        Force was organizing several Special Operational Wings. At that time, it was contemplated
        that a total of seven such wings, which are now designated Air Resupply and Communications
         (<gloss target="#t_ARC1">ARC</gloss>) Wings, would be organized. About a year later, the
        magnitude of this program was reconsidered in the light of over-all manpower limitations and
        the number of wings was reduced from seven to four. We now understand that consideration is
        being given to a still further curtailment which will reduce the number of wings to two, and
        that as a part of this plan the 500th <gloss target="#t_ARC1">ARC</gloss> Wing will move
        from Wheelus Field, Libya, to Molesworth Air Force Base, England, and the 581st <gloss
         target="#t_ARC1">ARC</gloss> Wing from Clark Field, R. F., to Okinawa.</item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>We are, of course, cognizant of the many problems which confront the USAF at this time.
        However, the reduction of the number of <gloss target="#t_ARC1">ARC</gloss> Wings to only
        two has serious implications upon our plans both for current operations and in the event of
        a “hot” war.</item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>During the “cold war,” <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has a very substantial and
        growing requirement for support in the serial transport, handling and storage of its
        matériel and supplies. This Agency depends upon the <gloss target="#t_ARC1">ARC</gloss>
        Wings to furnish a major part of such support. Manifestly, full utilization <pb n="425"
         xml:id="pg_425" facs="0454"/>of the capabilities of the <gloss target="#t_ARC1">ARC</gloss>
        Wings cannot be achieved rapidly, but it is believed that a good beginning toward such full
        utilization has been made and we are looking forward to a continuing expansion of our joint
        operations.</item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item>The wartime mission of the <gloss target="#t_ARC1">ARC</gloss> Wings is stated to be:
        (1) air support of Unconventional Warfare Operations; and (2) the preparation and
        dissemination of Psychological Warfare materials. While no formal agreement exists that the
        Wings will be available to support <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> covert operations,
        this Agency has always assumed that they would be, and war plans have been made on that
        basis. These war plans require the availability of effective air support facilities on D-Day
        for the immediate support of guerrilla and resistance operations. Following D-Day, there
        will be an increasing requirement for this type support to meet war plans jointly developed
        by the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. As I
        am sure you are aware, air support of covert operations requires that the personnel be
        highly trained in the peculiar techniques involved and have the specialized equipment to
        implement these techniques.</item>
       <label>5.</label>
       <item>If our understanding of the planned reduction to two wings is correct, it appears to us
        that improved utilization of the capabilities of the <gloss target="#t_ARC1">ARC</gloss>
        Wings under both “cold war” and “hot war” conditions, could be effected if storage and
        packaging facilities could be retained in the Tripoli area, thus giving greater flexibility
        to the support which the 580th <gloss target="#t_ARC1">ARC</gloss> Wing could render to us
        in the European-Near Eastern-African area. In effect, therefore, the Tripoli facilities
        would be a satellite of the permanent base at Molesworth. Similarly, in the Far East we
        would very much like to see comparable satellite facilities maintained at Clark Field
        because of the vital necessity of maintaining an adequate base in the sensitive Southeast
        Asia area. Our objective, which we believe is apparent, is to insure the maximum utility of
         <gloss target="#t_ARC1">ARC</gloss> by the maintenance of additional packing and storage
        facilities at Tripoli and at <persName>Clark</persName>. These facilities would give <gloss
         target="#t_ARC1">ARC</gloss>, and in turn <gloss target="#t_ARC1">ARC</gloss>, greatly
        increased flexibility and would enhance the operational utility of these organizations. By
        maintaining these additional packing and storage facilities, the reduction in the <gloss
         target="#t_ARC1">ARC</gloss> program from four to two wings, in our opinion, would be
        minimized.</item>
       <label>6.</label>
       <item>For obvious reasons, it is impossible for this Agency to predict accurately the time
        and place where <gloss target="#t_ARC1">ARC</gloss> Wing facilities will be most needed.
        However, in an endeavor to exploit to the utmost the capabilities of the two wings to give
        maximum support to the conduct of covert operations, the possibility of creating satellite
        facilities as outlined above is offered. While the movement of aircraft presents no major
        problem, the transfer of substantial amounts of supplies and matériel is very difficult to
        achieve, especially so under wartime conditions.</item>

       <item>For your present purposes, the following are worth noting: <list>
         <label>a.</label>
         <item>The Report assumes a Soviet stockpile of 120 in mid-1953 and 300 in mid-1955, and
          proceeds from these figures with an allocation of these levels between: (1) <gloss
           target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bases in US; (2) <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bases
          overseas; (3) other US targets. The assumed stockpile levels are the median <gloss
           target="#t_JAEIC1">JAEIC</gloss> figures, and the presumed allocations are regarded as
          logical attempts to inflict maximum damage on the US—they do not claim to be <hi
           rend="italic">the</hi> allocation the Soviets would necessarily make. As General
           <persName>Edwards</persName> is pointing out in his separate letter, a need exists for a
          systematic study of Soviet strategy in the event of war.</item>
         <label>b.</label>
         <item>General <persName>Webster</persName> of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
          “neither concurs nor non-concurs.” This unfortunate position is the result of the fact
          that the original terms of reference called for considering overseas installations, with
          reference to their importance to defence of the continental US and to a US
          counteroffensive. This limitation was insisted on by <persName corresp="#p_BGON1">General
           Bradley</persName> personally, in the original oral discussions with <persName
           corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>, specifically in order to avoid covering
          “every PT boat in the Adriatic.” It was the understanding of all who participated in the
          original laying out of the project that we would stick to the fewest possible bases
          abroad, and those would be related to the <hi rend="italic">air</hi> effort. Unfortunately
          the word “air” was omitted from the written form, although the
           <persName>Edwards</persName> Committee orally agreed to interpret it in this way. Thus,
          the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> working group got off and allocated a very small
          number of bombs (10, I believe) to <hi rend="italic">non-air</hi> targets such as ports
          and major ground supply dumps. The Committee threw out this allocation and stuck to the
          air bases—and at the last minute General <persName>Webster</persName> took the stand that
          he could not sign the report! The actual difference is minimal, and should not really
          affect the substance. But there it is.</item>
        </list></item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>In its basic conclusions, the report fully supports statements that the Soviets could
        probably damage the US critically in the next few years. While the damage predicated for
        mid-1955 is less than some thought it would be, the curve of bombs-on-target is obviously
        rising between mid-1953 and mid-1955. The Committee did not consider the possible effect of
        the early warning <persName>McGill</persName> and <persName>Lincoln</persName> lines, since
        it was thought they could not be effective by mid-1955. Whether the curve can be levelled
        off by defensive measures is now in controversy.</item>

      <p rend="flushleft">Dear General <persName>Bull</persName>:</p>
      <p>In response to your request of June 15,<note n="2" xml:id="d150fn2">Not further
        identified.</note> for the views of this Agency on organizational arrangements to provide
       the best possible continuing production of Net Capability Estimates, the following thoughts
       are submitted:</p>
      <p>There is no need to argue the necessity for reliable estimates of net capabilities as the
       basis for national policy formulation. These can only be prepared by careful integration of
       gross-capability intelligence of the enemy with our capabilities and plans, so that the net
       result of the interplay may be forecast as accurately as possible. This need is not confined
       to the problem of defense of North America but is equally inescapable for planning US
       requirements and commitments in any part of the globe.</p>
      <p>The President and the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> in practice and pursuant to
       statutory authority depend on the Director of Central Intelligence, representing the
       coordinated views of the Intelligence Agencies, for foreign intelligence estimates, and on
       the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, speaking as their representative, for military
       advice. Thus what is required to furnish the President and Council with guidance in the most
       useful and complete form is the effective amalgamation of the functions of the two.</p>
      <p>Responsibility for such combined analysis cannot rightly be assigned to one of these
       advisers to the exclusion of the other, for both are coordinate staff officers serving the
       same commander. Each must consider the factors developed by the other in order to eliminate
       reliance on arbitrary assumptions and produce valid and realistic forecasts.</p>
      <p>It is my view, therefore, that the President and Council should establish a permanent
       subcommittee on Net Capability Estimates to be composed of: <list>
        <item>The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff</item>
        <item>The Director of Central Intelligence</item>
       </list></p>
      <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0458"/>
      <p rend="flushleft">and that this subcommittee be charged with providing, on its initiative or
       as requested by the Council, estimates of net capabilities as needed to support the
       formulation of national policy.</p>
      <p>The manner in which this subcommittee would discharge its function should be left flexible
       and might very well differ substantially according to the nature of the estimate undertaken.
       It should have authority to secure support and information from all executive branches of the
       government and should be required to consult with such agencies and interdepartmental
       committees as may be able to contribute significantly to any estimate. The subcommittee
       should take such action as may be necessary to preserve the security of highly sensitive
       information such as U.S. war plans and intelligence sources.</p>
      <p>I believe you will find that the views expressed herein are substantially the same as those
       stated by <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> in his memorandum of 14
       October 1952 to the Executive Secretary of the National Security Council,<note n="3"

        n="5" xml:id="d150fn5">No record of these oral comments has been found.</note> Thus, though
       the need has long been recognized, no general or continuing machinery has yet been
       established. It is my earnest hope that as a result of the recommendations of your Committee,
       the Council will take necessary action along the lines I have indicated.</p>

      <p>[Omitted here are a cover page, title page, and table of contents.]</p>
      <p rend="center">I. Status of the Program on June 30, 1953</p>
      <p>1. The Board presents below a brief evaluative summary of the status of our national
       psychological programs as of June 30, 1953, based largely on the appended Progress Reports by
       the departments and agencies responsible for operations.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">General</hi></p>
      <p>2. While the President’s Committee on International Information Activities studied the
       whole problem of the world struggle with a view to basic improvements in the U.S. position,
       the struggle, on the psychological as on other fronts, was conducted with increased vigor.
       The most far-reaching opportunity came with <persName>Stalin</persName>’s death. The
       President’s speech of April 16<note n="2" xml:id="d153fn2">Reference is to President
         <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s “The Chance for Peace” speech; text in
         <hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>,
         1953</hi>, pp. 179–188.</note> was signally successful in capitalizing on the situation by
       appealing to the new leaders for an era of worldwide peace and friendship. The world at large
       received the speech with great enthusiasm, and the follow up support through psychological
       exploitation added to the initial success.</p>
      <p>3. Further exploitation of events behind the Iron Curtain has been guided by the
       requirement that psychological operations must be keyed in with political action. After
        <persName>Stalin</persName>’s death, the next major occasion for such action followed the
       outbreaks in Czechoslovakia and East Germany. Plans and operations were stepped up
       accordingly, with prospect of conducting a major campaign in the long-range contest to take
       full advantage of the consequences of <persName>Stalin</persName>’s death.</p>
      <p>4. Outside of the Soviet orbit the developments on the psychological front have been
       characterized by a disappointing deterioriation <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0462"/>in
       the attitudes towards the U.S. Non-Communist press and public opinion in Western Europe has
       reflected mounting criticism of U.S. foreign policy (the possible trend back to
       isolationism), and alleged anti-Communist “hysteria”. These unfavorable attitudes in
       combination with a generally more receptive reaction among Western European peoples to the
       Soviet “peace offensive” now constitute an intensification of anti-American feeling among
       significant elements of European opinion.</p>
      <p>5. World opinion has also been markedly unfavorable towards the development of U.S. foreign
       trade policies. At the same time that we are sharply reducing our programs for economic
       assistance, it has felt that we are providing little indication that our markets are to be
       opened up to foreign goods. Congressional criticism of our allies for their practices in the
       field of East-West trade, in combination with the new Soviet line on expansion of trade with
       the free world, has begun to have an adverse psychological impact around the world.</p>
      <p>6. Urgent planning for stronger psychological measures based on Thailand was set in motion
       as the result of the invasion of Laos and the accompanying threat of Communist aggression in
       Southeast Asia.</p>
      <p>7. While our overt psychological capabilities have been reduced by personnel difficulties,
       pressures in the Congress and appropriations cuts, covert capabilities continued to make
       sound progress, and faster and more energetic teamwork was secured through closer relations
       with the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> and the operating agencies.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Areas</hi></p>
      <p>8. Within the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"><hi rend="italic">USSR</hi></gloss> itself, radio
       still constitutes the only important means used currently to reach the Russian people.
       Jamming by the Russian radio of our broadcasts continues to present a major problem. There
       was however, a perceptible increase in effectiveness of our radio resources in the last six
       months due to the inauguration of Radio Liberation and the stepped-up activity of Radio Free
       Russia. In addition to the radio, leaflet distribution was utilized to reach Soviet military
       forces stationed outside the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
      <p>9. Similarly, in <hi rend="italic">Communist China</hi>, the major psychological activities
       presently available are radio and leaflet drops. Both of these are being substantially
       increased. Through <hi rend="italic">Hongkong</hi>, increased use is being made of overt,
       grey and black propaganda channels with the Chinese Mainland.</p>
      <p>10. In the <hi rend="italic">European Satellites</hi> likewise, radio is our major
       propaganda communications medium. <gloss target="#t_RIAS1">RIAS</gloss>, <gloss
        target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> have contributed to
       the building up of pressures that may be instrumental in weakening the
        <persName>Kremlin</persName>’s control of the satellites. In most of these <hi rend="italic"
        >Satellite States</hi>, progress in other forms of psychological activity, mainly
       unattributable, has been slow, and has centered on the build-up of operating potential. There
        <pb n="434" xml:id="pg_434" facs="0463"/>has, however, been increased action, including
       leaflet drops, in certain satellites—notably Albania, Bulgaria, and Rumania.</p>
      <p>11. A high degree of access to <hi rend="italic">East Germany</hi> was maintained despite
       increasing Soviet security restriction. Virtually the entire area has been continuously
       subjected to U.S. psychological programs through mainly indigenous channels.</p>
      <p>12. In <hi rend="italic">Western Europe</hi>, the presence of U.S. Armed Forces and the
       Military Aid program provided a significant psychological impact. Increased emphasis on troop
       acceptance programs enlisting the positive cooperation of the governments and the local
       authorities has brought about a definite improvement in most areas in the problem of avoiding
       friction between U.S. military personnel and foreign populations.</p>
      <p>13. Among the principal problems that have confronted U.S. psychological efforts in Western
       Europe during the past six months are increased criticism of the U.S. and, especially since
        <persName>Stalin</persName>’s death, the Soviet “Peace Offensive”. It is evident that many,
       if not all, Western European governments have been influenced to some extent by the
        <persName>Kremlin</persName>’s tension-reducing tactics. The effect has been to retard
       progress toward a number of our objectives, including the build-up of Western defenses, the
       ratification of EDC, and attainment of European integration.</p>
      <p>14. The U.S. counter-offensive has included fullest exploitation by the Department of
       State’s Information Program of the President’s Inaugural address<note n="3" xml:id="d153fn3"
        >Ibid., pp. 1–8.</note> and of his April 16 speech challenging the new leaders of the <gloss
        target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to prove their peaceful professions by deeds, not words.
       Copies of the latter were presented to Foreign Offices all over the world in advance of
       delivery and kinescopes of the entire speech were sent to seventy-three posts within a day of
       its delivery. One of these was shown over BBC television on April 20 to an estimated audience
       of 6,000,000. Five million pamphlets, handbills, and leaflets on the speech were prepared and
       distributed, and a documentary film of it in thirty-five languages had been produced and
       shipped by May 2.</p>
      <p>15. In <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>, U.S. efforts to aid the reelection of the Democratic
       Center Parties fell considerably short of their objective. The DeGasperi Coalition was
       returned to office by a slender margin and the Communists and extreme Rightists registered
       significant gains.</p>
      <p>16. In <hi rend="italic">France</hi>, the municipal elections in May showed that the
       Communists had suffered a slight set-back in rural areas, but had maintained their position
       in the industrial areas in larger cities. Governmental instability was a troublesome factor
       during the period and a relaxation of earlier French official measures to reduce the power of
       the Communist Party in France resulted. The repercussions of some Congressional <pb n="435"
        xml:id="pg_435" facs="0464"/>investigations, as well as of the Rosenberg executions, in
       conjunction with the <persName>Kremlin</persName>’s peace campaign, appear to have
       contributed to an increase in neutralism.</p>
      <p>17. In the <hi rend="italic">United Kingdom</hi> also, there appears to have been a marked
       increase in neutralism in its special British form of Bevanism. Although the belief is still
       widely held that Western unity must be preserved, three major elements contribute to the
       growth of anti-American feeling: <list>
        <label>(1)</label>
        <item>The belief that the U.S. is deeply divided on basic international policies,</item>
        <label>(2)</label>
        <item>The development of the Soviet “peace offensive”, and</item>
        <label>(3)</label>
        <item>The desire to exercise a more positive and independent initiative in international
         affairs.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>18. In <hi rend="italic">West Germany and Berlin</hi>, the recent riots touched off greatly
       increased pressures for unification, complicating the problems of German ratification of the
       EDC. With this exception, however, U.S. psychological programs in Berlin and West Germany, as
       well as their projection into East Germany, appear to have been fairly effective in promoting
       progress toward our major goal of a Democratic Germany integrated into Western defense
       efforts. Since late March German press opinion has reflected a decline in confidence in U.S.
       leadership. This was temporarily halted by the President’s April 16 speech, but has since
       been resumed. The two major factors contributing to this are: (1) the Soviet “peace
       offensive” and (2) lack of agreement within the U.S. on policy towards Germany.</p>
      <p>19. In the <hi rend="italic">Near and Middle East and South Asia</hi>, neutralism, and the
       tendency to associate the U.S. with “colonialism”, continued to present a major obstacle to
       the attainment of U.S. psychological objectives. In the Arab States, the alleged pro-Israel
       bias on the part of the U.S. remained a major handicap, although the visits to Middle Eastern
       capitals by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> may have alleviated this problem, at least temporarily.
       IIA has continuously exploited the beneficial aspects of these visits in its output to the
       area. Turkey, Pakistan, and Greece appear to be the brightest spots in this area,
       psychologically speaking.</p>
      <p>20. In the <hi rend="italic">Far East</hi>, the resumption of Korean truce talks raised
       major psychological problems. The exchange of sick and wounded prisoners necessitated special
       measures to deal with “brain washing”. Steps were taken to achieve more effectively
       coordinated guidance on information matters concerning Korea through the channels of the
       Psychological Operations Coordinating Committee. The offer of a reward to MIG pilot defectors
       was followed by an immediate and significant shift in Communist air tactics over the Korean
       battle area.</p>
      <p>21. In <hi rend="italic">Japan</hi>, severe economic problems and growing neutralist
       resistance to the U.S. objective of Japanese rearmament have been <pb n="436" xml:id="pg_436"
        facs="0465"/>trouble spots in a picture otherwise fairly satisfactory. “Grey” and
       unattributable activities have progressed favorably.</p>
      <p>22. In <hi rend="italic">Latin America</hi>, our capabilities for effective psychological
       action increased in a number of countries, for the most part in the field of unattributable
       activity. There has been growing dissatisfaction in many Latin American countries directed
       mainly against American economic policies. To help offset this, a major psychological move
       was Dr. <persName>Milton Eisenhower</persName>’s goodwill tour of South America initiated
       late in June.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Special Items</hi></p>
      <p>23. Emergency assistance provided by U.S. Armed Forces in cases of national catastrophe has
       made material contributions to U.S. psychological efforts in <hi rend="italic">The
        Netherlands, England, Turkey, Greece, Iran, Ecuador</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"
       >Japan</hi>.</p>
      <p>24. A grant of 1,000,000 tons of wheat to <hi rend="italic">Pakistan</hi> has had a
       similarly favorable effect.</p>
      <p>25. Carefully planned exploitation of U.S. leadership in the atomic field, with a
       coordinated public information program on the Nevada weapons tests and other special weapons,
       as well as certain news leaks that gave rise to widespread speculation as to the explosion of
       a thermo-nuclear device at Eniwetok atoll, contributed to the U.S. psychological effort.</p>

      <head>154. Editorial Note</head>
      <p>In March 1951, <persName>Jacobo Arbenz Guzman</persName> was sworn in as President of
       Guatemala. A climate of labor unrest and fears of a possible Sovietization of Guatemala soon
       prompted opposition groups to begin plotting against the <persName>Arbenz</persName> regime.
       Prominent among the plotters was an exiled army colonel, <persName>Carlos Castillo
        Armas</persName>. <persName>Castillo Armas</persName>, based in Honduras, had the active
       support of Nicaragua’s Anastasio Somoza and the United Fruit Company. By early 1952, the
        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, concerned about <persName>Arbenz</persName>’s growing
       reliance on left-wing activists, including members of the Communist Party, had made contact
       with <persName>Castillo Armas</persName>. Plans for assistance were dropped in October 1952,
       however, after rumors of U.S. involvement became widespread and <persName>Arbenz</persName>’s
       forces began taking preemptive action.</p>
      <pb n="437" xml:id="pg_437" facs="0466"/>
      <p>Guatemala re-emerged as a priority during the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
        >Eisenhower</persName> administration. On August 12, 1953, the Guatemalans announced their
       second expropriation of United Fruit Company land. On that same day, the Operations
       Coordinating Board authorized the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to proceed “on a basis
       of high priority” on the project which was to become PBSUCCESS. Utilizing a $3 million
       budget, the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> trained <persName>Castillo Armas</persName>”
       men and expanded contacts with Guatemalan army officers in hopes of persuading them to
       overthrow the government from inside. Fears that <persName>Arbenz</persName> would form an
       open alliance with the Communists were reinforced when a Swedish ship carrying Communist-bloc
       weaponry arrived in Guatemala in May 1954. American officials used this event to reinforce
       Guatemalan army fears that <persName>Arbenz</persName> wanted to arm a people’s militia,
       under party discipline, to nullify the army’s power.</p>
      <p><persName>Castillo Armas</persName> and his men invaded Guatemala from Honduran territory
       on June 18, 1954, and were soon engaged in a series of inconclusive battles with larger
       Guatemalan army formations. Intense American diplomatic and propaganda pressure, as well as
       airstrikes by World War II era fighters flown by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> contract
       pilots, created a sense of confusion and crisis among <persName>Arbenz</persName> and his
       regime. Meanwhile, clandestine <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> contacts with the regular
       army finally persuaded several powerful officers to confront <persName>Arbenz</persName>, who
       resigned on June 27, 1954. Over the next few days, American diplomats and intelligence
       officers helped broker the ticklish negotiations between <persName>Castillo Armas</persName>
       and the officers who led the coup. <persName>Castillo Armas</persName> was eventually
       installed as President of Guatemala. See <ref target="frus1952-54Guat"><hi rend="italic"

       <item>The organization and procedures established since October 1950 for the production of
        national intelligence estimates continue to operate satisfactorily. The totality of
        resources of the entire intelligence community is drawn upon to produce national
        intelligence estimates, and they can be improved only as we strengthen these resources.
        These estimates derive authority from the manner of their preparation and from the active
        participation of all the responsible intelligence agency heads in their final review and
        adoption. Agency dissents are recorded where estimates would be watered down by further
        efforts to secure agreement.</item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>A production program for national intelligence estimates is prepared annually and
        reviewed quarterly at which time obligatory changes are made. This program provides for a
        re-examination of existing estimates on critical areas or problems as well as the production
        of new estimates designed to improve the coverage of important topics. Continued emphasis is
        placed on the completion of basic estimates on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in

       <item>Close coordination between planners and policy-makers on the one hand and the

       <item>The status of political, social and cultural intelligence has been very good, due
        allowance being made for the paucity of information on the Soviet Orbit and the difficulties
        of collecting it. Facilities for the production of such intelligence, however, have been

       <item>The principal deficiency in this field, which varies from slight to serious, has been

        European Satellite complex, and China, has been most nearly adequate. Relatively lower
        priority has been given to research on other areas, with Western Europe, Japan and Southeast
        Asia at the upper end of the scale, graduating downward to Latin America and Africa. The
        inadequacy of resources has been reflected chiefly in an inability to prosecute sustained
        research programs at all desired points. Nonetheless, there has remained sufficient
        flexibility to produce individual studies of considerable depth on selected major problems.
        World Communism, outside the Soviet Orbit, has been satisfactorily covered with respect to
        party strength, political maneuverings and relationships to the Moscow propaganda lines.
        Research into matters of organization, financial support and infiltration into political and

      <p>Intelligence covering the combat zone area for the support of current military operations
       in Korea is generally adequate. There still remains a serious deficiency in our ability to
       obtain timely identification of or information on the movements or locations of Chinese
       forces in all areas behind the immediate front line armies in Korea back through Manchuria
       into China. Information on installations and on developments in Manchuria, such as types and
       extent of training, reorganization and resupply of the Chinese Communist Forces and North
       Korean units north of the Yalu River is inadequate. This deficiency remains substantially
       unchanged. Reliable information on the enemy’s long-range plans and intentions is practically
       non-existent.</p>
      <p>The extent of our information on Chinese Communist activities in South China is inadequate.
       The United States is dependent on French and Associated States sources for operational
       intelligence concerning the Viet Minh and to a lesser extent for information on the Chinese
       Communists in the border areas contiguous to Indochina. The present level of information
       would be inadequate for support of operations by U.S. forces; however, inherent in any
       commitment of U.S. forces would <pb n="441" xml:id="pg_441" facs="0470"/>be the rapid
       development of combat and operational intelligence efforts. The Five-power Intelligence
       Conference exchanges have increased U.S. knowledge of the Viet Minh.</p>
      <p>A possible early augmentation of U.S. intelligence personnel in Indochina should improve
       present U.S. coverage in that area. However, the picture for the major target area in Asia,
       i.e., Communist China, is very dark.</p>

       primarily because of the extreme difficulty of collection. Intelligence on Communist Bloc
       units and equipment in most areas with which the United States or nations friendly to the
       United States are in contact is more nearly complete and reliable.</p>
      <p>Coverage on order of battle intelligence and equipment is generally adequate in respect of

       Current target systems studies are reasonably adequate to support joint operational planning
       but more vigorous data collection efforts will be required to maintain these studies on a
       current basis and to support extended systems analysis to meet detailed service
       requirements.</p>
      <p>Target intelligence required to counter the Soviet atomic threat continues to be

        of sources. For the Soviet Bloc, however, such intelligence is far from adequate. The Soviet
        government does publish some aggregate statistics of uncertain reliability which, however,
        can be profitably utilized by careful analysis. Apart from this source, the intelligence
        community is confined to exploiting a diminishing flow of low-grade data, much of which is
        becoming increasingly out of date. Only by taking advantage of every possible item of
        information in the course of a comprehensive, thoroughly planned and coordinated study can
        national security needs for knowledge of the Bloc’s economic capabilities and
        vulnerabilities by met. This may mean the subordination of short-term requirements to the
        long-range program and a resolute and imaginative attack on problems of centralized indexing
        and exploitation of all pertinent materials, whether overt or classified. Individual
        industry studies now being produced will form the foundation for interindustry and other
        over-all analyses. Maximum utilization of available data will result from the application of
        improved statistical and other techniques.</item>

       machine techniques is providing assistance in dealing with these problems.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">2. Reference Facilities</hi></p>
      <p><gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> provides a central reference facility for the <gloss
        target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> agencies through its collection of basic intelligence documents
       received from all sources. In addition, separate files of specialized intelligence data and
       materials are maintained to supplement the basic collection of the <gloss target="#t_IAC1"
        >IAC</gloss> agencies. These include biographic data, industrial data, photographs and
       motion picture films.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">3. Library Facilities</hi></p>
      <p>Library services in the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> agencies should become
       increasingly effective as a result of new measures for interlibrary cooperation in
       publications procurement, indexing and reference service.</p>
      <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0480"/>
      <p>Another measure, stemming from the scarcity of Soviet Orbit publications, is <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> sponsorship of publication by the Library of Congress of the
        <hi rend="italic">Monthly List of Russian Accessions</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Cyrillic
        Subject Union Catalog</hi>. Both services are based on cooperative reporting of holdings by
       all major U.S. libraries specializing in Slavic publications.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">4. Biographic Information</hi></p>
      <p>Each <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> agency maintains a file of biographic data on
       foreign personalities in the categories for which they have been assigned basic
       responsibility, and makes such data available to the other agencies upon request. Excellent
       data can be made available on political, military, economic, and scientific personalities.
       The depth of coverage varies with the intelligence interest, and with availability of source
       material. In those Iron Curtain areas where information is not easily obtained, the <gloss
        target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> agencies provide for more comprehensive coverage of the press,
       radio, and scientific and technical literature. There are extensive programs for the
       exploitation of displaced persons, returning PW’s, and defectors, as well as other personnel
       having a knowledge of personalities in various areas. Every effort is made to include in
       dossiers that biographic information which is needed by intelligence researchers, such as
       political orientation, ability, susceptibility to psychological warfare, probable course of
       action, past career, religion, marital status, associates, membership in cliques, location,
       etc.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">5. Industrial Information</hi></p>
      <p>Specialized data to meet departmental needs are maintained by the Defense Agencies. <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> collates all other types of foreign industrial information,
       including research establishments doing industrial research and development work. The
       material is maintained by individual establishment and is controlled by a tabulating card
       indexing system. References to industrial end-products are being indexed by tabulating
       machine methods to speed the analysis of data being supplied to all <gloss target="#t_IAC1"
        >IAC</gloss> agencies.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">6. Photographs and Motion Picture Films</hi></p>
      <p>The several Defense agencies and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> each maintain
       photographic and related documentary libraries, including motion picture films, consistent
       with their requirements and responsibilities. Except for postwar coverage of Soviet and
       Satellite Areas, the photographic support is nearly adequate for present needs.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">7. Map Procurement and Reference Service</hi></p>
      <p>Procurement of foreign-published maps and information on mapping abroad is coordinated by a
       staff within <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> serving an interagency map committee.
       Results during the past three years have proved the <pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452" facs="0481"
       />effectiveness of overt collection of maps and related information through the Foreign
       Service Geographic Attaché program. Increased emphasis is being placed on the collection of
       maps and engineering drawings from domestic sources. Service Attaché channels are also being
       used. The currently published foreign maps required for intelligence activities are received
       on a continuing basis through exchange arrangements between the Department of State and many
       foreign official mapping agencies. These exchanges are in addition to those of an operational
       character maintained by the Military Service. Excellent map reference services in support of
       intelligence requirements are maintained by close working arrangements between the map
       libraries.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">8. Foreign Language Publications</hi></p>
      <p>Approval of <gloss target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss> 16<note n="10" xml:id="d155fn10"><ref
         target="#d258">Document 258</ref>.</note> has given new impetus to cooperative <gloss
        target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> activity in this field, and definite progress is being made
       toward implementation of the directive. An interagency advisory committee and its
       subcommittees are working on methods of improving the coordination of procurement and
       exploitation of foreign language publications for intelligence purposes. <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is taking action to centralize its library, reference, and
       indexing services for foreign language books and periodicals, and to facilitate the use of
       such services by other agencies. Efforts are being made to coordinate operations, apportion
       the workload, and reduce duplication between the following activities: overseas abstracting
       by US missions to satisfy the local and departmental needs; exploitation by various agencies
       of technical and other publications to fulfill specific requirements; and exploitation by
        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> of foreign language publications for information of
       interest to more than one intelligence agency. A central index of translations, maintained by
        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, prevents duplication between the translating activities
       carried on by each agency, and makes the translated product accessible to other intelligence
       consumers.</p>
      <p>Good coverage of foreign publications needed for the intelligence effort is now being
       obtained, although further intensive collection action should be undertaken with regard to
       Soviet Bloc and Communist Chinese publications.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">9. External Research</hi></p>
      <p>Plans for developing further coordination of external and contractual research in the
       social sciences (i.e., non-governmental) of interest to intelligence suffered modification
       when the Department of State felt obliged to cut back severely its expenditure in the
       External <pb n="453" xml:id="pg_453" facs="0482"/>Research Staff. Contributions from <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and the Department of Defense will permit continuation of the
       existing program, but by no means full realization of the scale of operation which seemed to
       be in sight before the current budgetary allocations were determined. For the foreseeable
       future, therefore, there will continue to be imperfections in the efforts to minimize
       duplication in external research, to insure community benefit from such research and to
       facilitate the rational letting of external research contracts.</p>
      <p>Positive recommendations for a better balanced and integrated program of research in the
       fields of psychological and unconventional warfare within the Department of Defense have been
       made by an advisory group to the RDB. Action on the report has been deferred pending
       reorganizations of the research and development program of the Defense Department.</p>
      <p>The Economic Intelligence Committee plans to compile a report of all government sponsored
       economic external research on the Soviet Bloc classified through Secret. The report would
       include completed research, research in progress, and contemplated research.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Note:</hi> In lieu of a financial statement, not included in the above
       report, the Director of Central Intelligence will make an oral report to the National
       Security Council on <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>’s expenditures. The oral report will
       pertain only to <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> data and will not include expenditures on

       <p rend="center">Paragraph 5, “Espionage”, of Part XI, “Collection”, in No. 9, The Foreign
        Intelligence Program</p>
       <p>Since the submission of the last report, the difficulties incident to the collection of
        covert intelligence within the Soviet and Satellite orbit remain unchanged. Basic control
        procedures exercised by the various opposition security services make it more and more
        apparent that “black” penetration of denied areas is increasingly hazardous, and because of
        its illegal nature does not insure accessibility to strategic targets. In addition, the
        pressure of these control procedures is a continuing and serious threat to the limited
        assets painfully created by successful operations in the past. Although the situation is
        relatively less critical in Satellite areas, particularly East Germany, recent events may
        even endanger this coverage.</p>
       <pb n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0483"/>
       <p>In an effort to meet this situation, the covert mechanism has maintained a high degree of
        flexibility in order that all possible avenues of approach are carefully examined in
        relation to changing conditions. In this regard steps have been taken to exploit the recent
        tempering of controls on foreign travel to the Soviet orbit. The validity of this approach
        will depend largely on the extent to which the Soviet Union wishes to push its “peace
        offensive” by a relaxation of travel controls, and the availability of properly motivated
        individuals who will naturally blend into this framework. These contingencies do not permit
        an optimistic outlook but represent a possible alternative, and perhaps in time may serve to
        avoid an almost complete dependence on illegal entry.</p>
       <p>Suffice it to say that progress in the delicate and highly specialized field of covert
        intelligence collection is hardly perceptible on a short-range reporting base and
        significant successes in the immediate future do not seem likely. At the same time
        meaningful and usable intelligence is being produced, support facilities developed and
        strengthened, and valuable experience, both in operations and career development of
        personnel, is being acquired.</p>

      <p rend="center">EXECUTIVE ORDER 10483 ESTABLISHING THE OPERATIONS COORDINATING BOARD</p>
      <p>By virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes, and as President
       of the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
      <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455" facs="0484"/>
      <p>Section 1. (a) In order to provide for the integrated implementation of national security
       policies by the several agencies, there is hereby established an Operations Coordinating
       Board, hereinafter referred to as the Board, which shall report to the National Security
       Council.</p>
      <p>(b) The Board shall have as members the following: (1) the Under Secretary of State, who
       shall represent the Secretary of State and shall be the chairman of the Board, (2) the Deputy
       Secretary of Defense, who shall represent the Secretary of Defense, (3) the Director of the
       Foreign Operations Administration, (4) the Director of Central Intelligence, and (5) a
       representative of the President to be designated by the President. Each head of agency
       referred to in items (1) to (4), inclusive, in this section 1(b) may provide for an alternate
       member who shall serve as a member of the Board in lieu of the regular member representing
       the agency concerned when such regular member is for reasons beyond his control unable to
       attend any meeting of the Board; and any alternate member shall while serving as such have in
       all respects the same status as a member of the Board as does the regular member in lieu of
       whom he serves.</p>
      <p>(c) The head of any agency (other than any agency represented under section 1(b) hereof) to
       which the President from time to time assigns responsibilities for the implementation of
       national security policies, shall assign a representative to serve on the Board when the
       Board is dealing with subjects bearing directly upon the responsibilities of such head. Each
       such representative shall be an Under Secretary or corresponding official and when so serving
       such representative shall have the same status on the Board as the members provided for in
       the said section 1(b).</p>
      <p>(d) The Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs may attend any
       meeting of the Board. The Director of the United States Information Agency shall advise the
       Board at its request.</p>
      <p>Section 2. The National Security Council having recommended a national security policy and
       the President having approved it, the Board shall (1) whenever the President shall hereafter
       so direct, advise with the agencies concerned as to (a) their detailed operational planning
       responsibilities respecting such policy, (b) the coordination of the interdepartmental
       aspects of the detailed operational plans developed by the agencies to carry out such policy,
       (c) the timely and coordinated execution of such policy and plans, and (d) the execution of
       each security action or project so that it shall make its full contribution to the attainment
       of national security objectives and to the particular climate of opinion the United States is
       seeking to achieve in the world, and (2) initiate new proposals for action within the
       framework of national security policies in response to opportunity and changes in the
       situation. The Board shall perform such other advisory functions as the President may assign
       to it and shall from time to time make reports to the National Security Council with respect
       to the carrying out of this order.</p>
      <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0485"/>
      <p>Section 3. Consonant with law, each agency represented on the Board shall, as may be
       necessary for the purpose of effectuating this order, furnish assistance to the Board in
       accordance with section 214 of the Act of May 3, 1945, 59 Stat. 134 (31 U.S.C. 691).<note
        n="2" xml:id="d157fn2">This section of the act authorizes Executive branch departments to
        use appropriations to support interagency boards.</note> Such assistance may include
       detailing employees to the Board, one of whom may serve as its Executive Officer, to perform
       such functions, consistent with the purposes of this order, as the Board may assign to
       them.</p>
      <p>Section 4. The Psychological Strategy Board shall be abolished not later than sixty days
       after the date of this order and its outstanding affairs shall be wound up by the Operations
       Coordinating Board.</p>
      <p>Section 5. As used herein, the word “agency” may be construed to mean any instrumentality
       of the executive branch of the Government, including any executive department.</p>
      <p>Section 6. Nothing in this order shall be construed either to confer upon the Board any
       function with respect to internal security or to in any manner abrogate or restrict any
       function vested by law in, or assigned pursuant to law to, any agency or head of agency
       (including the Office of Defense Mobilization and the Director of the Office of Defense

      <p rend="flushleft">Dear <persName corresp="#p_CGCP1">General Cabell</persName>:</p>
      <p>The 1954 budget of the Foreign Service has been substantially reduced. This reduction comes
       at a time when there are demands, requirements, many of particular concern to <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, for an increase in intelligence collection activities.
       Moreover, this reduction will no doubt continue in effect in subsequent years, and will thus
       have a long-term effect on the functions of the Foreign Service, including the collection of
       intelligence information from overt sources. Such collection has included: (a) collection of
       foreign publications; (b) collection of maps and cartographic data; (c) peripheral reporting;
       (d) collection of scientific information; (e) foreign press monitoring services.</p>
      <p>The Department recognizes that these overt collection activities are responsibilities of
       the Foreign Service and are important to the national security. They are hence of concern to
       the Director of Central Intelligence in view of his duty to advise the National Security
       Council in such matters.</p>
      <p>In an effort to satisfy these demands of intelligence and to continue to carry out the
       Department’s responsibilities for the direction <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0488"/>and
       management of the Foreign Service of the United States, the Department proposes in the
       attached document<note n="2" xml:id="d159fn2">Not found.</note> a framework within which, on
       the basis of national security needs, it would be possible for the Director to meet his
       responsibilities. Under this proposal, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> could provide
       financial support for collection activities beyond a stated minimum which the Department can
       provide under its budget.</p>
      <p>The Department believes that, if this framework is acceptable, it would probably be
       desirable to consult or at least inform <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> on this proposal
       and, if appropriate, advise the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>. Furthermore, the
       Department believes that, when and as appropriate, there should be consultation with the
       Bureau of the Budget and with the proper committees of Congress.</p>

       <pb n="460" xml:id="pg_460" facs="0489"/>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>The Board authorized the Acting Executive Officer to use the <gloss target="#t_PSB1"
         >PSB</gloss> staff and resources for <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> work until other
        arrangements are made.</item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>The Board decided that the general pattern of present <gloss target="#t_PSB1"
         >PSB</gloss> administrative support arrangement should be continued for the balance of this
        fiscal year.</item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item>Noting that the table of organization for <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> staff
        should be authorized and an administrative support agreement concluded by September 30, the
        Board instructed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Morgan</persName> to prepare drafts for
        consideration at the next Board meeting. The Board indicated that the <gloss
         target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> staff should be kept to a minimum and developed only as the
        workload demands. The basic function should be that of a working secretariat, including that
        of acting as chairmen and executive secretaries of meetings and generally serving as
        catalysts in the coordination process, but there should also be a small nucleus of
        planners.</item>
       <label>5.</label>
       <item>The Board noted that all <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> approved papers and
        projects remain in force until specifically dealt with by <gloss target="#t_OCB1"
         >OCB</gloss>.</item>
       <label>6.</label>
       <item>It was agreed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JCD1">Jackson</persName> should review
        existing <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> projects and approved papers and make
        recommendations to the Board for their disposition.</item>
       <label>7.</label>
       <item>The need for good backstopping of the Board in the member agencies was discussed. It
        was agreed that each Board member would have a principal assistant for this purpose who
        would attend formal Board meetings. It was also suggested that these assistants and Mr.
         <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Morgan</persName> serve as a senior staff to screen work for
        the Board, but decision on this proposal was reserved pending further study.</item>
       <label>8.</label>
       <item>The need for close liaison and a sound division of labor with the <gloss
         target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board was stressed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGA1"
         >Morgan</persName> was instructed to circulate <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> papers
        to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> for information, notify him of meetings,
        and in consultation with him recommend any further arrangements needed for <gloss
         target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> liaison. Mr. <persName
         corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> designated Mr. <persName>T. B. Koons</persName> of the
         <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Staff to maintain standing liaison with Mr. <persName
         corresp="#p_MGA1">Morgan</persName> on <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> matters, and
        also noted that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Morgan</persName> attends Planning Board
        meetings as an adviser. With regard to assignments to <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>
        from <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>
        mentioned a number of implementation assignments to other agencies now in force. It was
        agreed that these assignments would stay as they are rather than being transferred to <gloss
         target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> at this time, thus giving <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>
        a chance to start without assuming such a back-load of accumulated responsibilities. Mr.
         <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> agreed to put a memorandum of this agreement
        in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> records and to send Mr. <persName
         corresp="#p_MGA1">Morgan</persName> a copy.</item>
       <label>9.</label>
       <item>The Board noted its obligation to make progress reports to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
         >NSC</gloss> and decided that these should ordinarily be made at intervals of six months,
        and otherwise only when specially needed.</item>
       <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461" facs="0490"/>
       <label>10.</label>
       <item>The Board decided to continue existing arrangements for handling 10/2 matters through a
        panel composed of representatives of State, Defense and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>,
        with the addition that the panel is to be chaired by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JCD1"
         >Jackson</persName> and that <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> is to designate one
        officer who will be invited to attend meetings when matters of concern to <gloss
         target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> are discussed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
         >Dulles</persName> reserved the right to bring certain matters in this field directly to
        the Board.</item>
       <label>11.</label>
       <item>It was agreed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Morgan</persName> should hold a
        meeting of appropriate representatives next week to discuss recommendations for <gloss
         target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> assuming the functions of <gloss target="#t_POCC1"
         >POCC</gloss>.</item>
       <label>12.</label>
       <item>The Board decided to continue meeting usually on Wednesdays at 12:30 and to follow the
        informal meeting with a formal meeting at 1:30, which would also be attended by the
        principal assistant of each Board member and necessary secretariat.</item>
       <label>13.</label>

       <item>We agree with your suggestion that a thorough review of our present policy toward the
        Soviet nationalities should be made. It appears that most of the decisions reached affecting
        the development of psychological warfare against the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
        may not have given the most appropriate emphasis to the exploitation of the non-Russian
        ethnic groups within the Soviet Union. As I understand the matter, the old State Department
        policy has rested in large part upon the contention that a showing of interest, on our part,
        in the non-Russian peoples will arouse the antagonism of the Great Russians, who would
        interpret our actions as designed to dismember the Soviet Union, and could, for that reason,
        be turned against us propagandistically as well as exploited within Russia as a strong
        appeal for internal unity and support of the <persName>Kremlin</persName> regime. Within the
        framework of this approach a policy of non-predetermination or ultimate self-determination
        has been adopted and adhered to by all covert asset facilities under our control. Since
         <persName>Beria</persName>’s liquidation,<note n="3" xml:id="d161fn3"><persName>Lavrenty
          Beria</persName>, head of Soviet internal security, was arrested in the Soviet Union in
         July 1953. His execution was publicly announced December 23, 1953.</note> and in view of
        the latest developments in the Soviet Union, however, we feel that re-evaluation of our
        present position is desirable. The purpose of such a review should be not to abandon the
        policy of non-predetermination, but rather to extend its application to permit fuller
        exploitation of the vulnerabilities inherent in the Soviet system.</item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>In this connection, it is my understanding that as a result of the proposed merger of
        the two <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> documents, i.e. D–40 and D–45,<note n="4"
         xml:id="d161fn4"><gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> D–40, April 23, is in National

          >NSC</gloss> Registry Series, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Staff Papers, Box
         16.</note> the Soviet nationalities issue will be once more reviewed by the new <gloss
         target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> working group. Their findings and recommendations will then be
        submitted either through the Department of State or Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">George
         Morgan</persName>,<note n="5" xml:id="d161fn5">Acting Director, Psychological Strategy
         Board.</note> to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board. We can, therefore,
        expect that the final document will be presented to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>,
        and after its approval it will serve as policy authorization for implementation of
        activities in connection with this important issue.</item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>I have one further observation to make in this connection, even though I appreciate
        that it is at the risk of going into certain details with which I believe you are quite
        familiar. The old policy upon which we have been basing our actions and certain of our more
        important operations, has never, to the best of my knowledge, achieved formal <pb n="463"
         xml:id="pg_463" facs="0492"/>“governmental status”. By this I mean that the policy has
        never been threshed out at the higher policy levels of Government or gone into with
        sufficient thoroughness, and certainly I do not think it has been gone into by the present
        Administration to the depth that I consider warranted by a matter of such importance. I know
        that you are well acquainted with the various sharply-conflicting points of view which make
        this such a controversial issue both within the ranks of the Soviet emigration and also in
        American public opinion (including congressional opinion). One of the unfortunate results of
        this controversy is that in the present atmosphere and in the absence of a sufficiently
        authoritative policy determination, the governmental officials charged with responsibility
        for the execution of the policy are subject to criticism and attack to a degree which is
        unnecessary, and which would, in my judgment, be minimized if we had a sufficiently clear
        and high-level determination of policy.</item>

           1945–1950, Emergence of the Intelligence Establishment, Document 292</ref>. The comments
          referred to have not been further identified.</note> for the reason that by such complete
         deletion it seems to me that we deprive ourselves unnecessarily of the evidence that there
         has been a deliberate and conscious determination <pb n="464" xml:id="pg_464" facs="0493"
         />on the part of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> that covert operations and
         espionage and counter-espionage operations should be placed within the structure of the
         Central Intelligence Agency, and that the two should be correlated under the control of the
         Director of Central Intelligence. I agree that portions of the old language should be
         deleted for various reasons, since they are no longer applicable and may be undesirable.
         However, because of the lengthy and often heated philosophical and bureaucratic discussions
         about the desirability of having <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> made responsible for
         covert operations other than intelligence—and in view of the criticisms and attacks which
         are still being leveled against the Agency along this very line—it seems to me useful for
         us to be able to point to this language which is a clear and unequivocal indication of a
         determination of the long disputed issue by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>. My
         purposes in this regard could be accomplished by the following minor changes in the
         language of the paragraph. I would retain the first sentence as written, since this is a
         useful reconfirmation of the fact that the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is charged
         by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> with conducting espionage and counter-espionage
         operations abroad. (We are having enough trouble with other members of the intelligence
         community at the present time to render it undesirable for us to voluntarily sacrifice any
         language from an important Governmental document which either provides or confirms our
         authority in this particular field.) The last sentence could be changed to read as follows:
          <quote rend="blockquote">
          <p>“It is therefore determined to be desirable that the responsibility for covert
           operations should be retained within the structure of the Central Intelligence Agency
           where they can best be correlated with espionage and counter-espionage operations under
           the control of the Director of Central Intelligence.”</p></quote></p></item>

        anything, further consideration should be given to the inclusion of the newly created IIA

       <item>In paragraph 3.b. at the bottom of page 3 of Attachment A, I would recommend the
        insertion of the word “official” between the words “with” and “overt.” The present language
        dangles a bit since the overt activities referred to are not in any way specified.</item>

       <item>In paragraph 4. I notice that the old language of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
        10/2 is retained intact, and although the language is pretty good from our standpoint in its
        present form, it does not provide for situations such as Korea. The present language speaks
        of “active theaters of <hi rend="italic">war</hi> where American forces are engaged.” It is
        my recollection that <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> worked out
        language with the Pentagon and the Far East Command to cover the in-between situation and
        undeclared hostilities, and the language of the telegrams by which this agreement was
        arrived at and established might be profitably consulted in this connection.</item>
       <label>6.</label>
       <item>For better clarification of the proposed new sentence at the end of paragraph 5. I
        would recommend the insertion of the words “conceived as” between the words “initially” and
        “covert”; and also the inclusion of a comma between the words “definitions” and “and
        responsibility”.</item>

      <p><gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2 of October 30, 1953, “Basic National Security
       Policy,” set forth President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s Cold War
       strategy, which included several policy formulations of importance to the intelligence
       community. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2 declared that United States security
       required the development and maintenance of an intelligence system capable of: “1) collecting
       and analyzing indications of hostile intentions that would give maximum prior warning of
       possible aggression or subversion in <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0495"/>any area of the
       world; 2) accurately evaluating the capabilities of foreign countries, friendly and neutral
       as well as enemy, to undertake military, political, economic and subversive courses of action
       affecting U.S. security; and 3) forecasting potential foreign developments having a bearing
       on U.S. national security.”</p>
      <p>As a means to reduce Soviet capabilities to control or influence the free world, <gloss
        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2 also called on the government to: “a) take overt and
       covert measures to discredit Soviet prestige and ideology as effective instruments of Soviet
       power, and to reduce the strength of communist parties and other pro-Soviet elements; b) take
       all feasible diplomatic, political, economic and covert measures to counter any threat of a
       party or individuals directly or indirectly responsive to Soviet control to achieve dominant
       power in a free world country; and c) undertake selective, positive actions to eliminate

      <p rend="flushleft">Dear <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen</persName>:</p>
      <p>In the course of my trip through Europe in September, my attention was drawn to a number of
       areas in which there appear to be serious weaknesses in the furtherance of our over-all
       intelligence effort. While I do not have personal knowledge of some of the items which I
       shall mention, <persName corresp="#p_EGGB1">General Erskine</persName>, at my request,
       examined the intelligence picture from the field commanders’ point of view and provided <pb
        n="468" xml:id="pg_468" facs="0497"/>me with the benefit of his observations. I realize, of
       course, that most, if not all these matters are no strangers to you, but perhaps my views
       will not be amiss as a slightly different slant.</p>
      <p>I am fully convinced that the successful prosecution of any military program has its very
       foundation in the quantity, quality, and proper dissemination of intelligence. I am very
       aware that deficiencies exist in the Department of Defense intelligence agencies and am
       taking steps to correct those faults. Correction of the following deficiencies, which lie in
       the covert field and, therefore, fall within your purview, appears to be of vital importance
       to the country: <list>
        <label>a.</label>
        <item>Lateral dissemination of information by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> field
         agencies to local commanders appears necessary and logical. For example, it seems that
         USCINCEUR should receive <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> field reports directly and not
         be required to wait for distribution of screened material from Washington.</item>
        <label>b.</label>
        <item>The penetration of the “iron curtain” by covert means falls far short of our
         requirements. [<hi rend="italic">5½ lines not declassified</hi>]</item>
        <label>c.</label>
        <item>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (7 lines) not declassified]</hi></item>
        <label>d.</label>
        <item>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (9½ lines) not declassified</hi>]</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>There are other points which should be discussed in detail. I’m sure you will agree that
       improved coordination between our agencies will improve the efficiency of our respective
       intelligence operations. I therefore suggest that our appropriate staff officers meet as soon
       as possible to go over these matters of common interest. <persName corresp="#p_EGGB1">General
        Erskine</persName> will represent the Department of Defense if you concur.</p>

       <label>1.</label>
       <item>Referring to our conversations of Wednesday afternoon, 6 January, at which time you
        informed me of certain statements made to you by Mr.<persName corresp="#p_JCD1">C. D.

        plans of a general character to either whip up or exploit uprisings which may occur in the

          the infiltration thereof either at the present time or under any specific set of
          circumstances in the future.</item>
        </list></item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>The fact that there appears to be a lack of understanding at higher governmental levels
        on this general subject is, I believe, a very serious matter. I think it is essential that

        </list></item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>Actually, it is my own understanding, which is shared by <persName>Dick
         Helms</persName> and by <persName>Tracy Barnes</persName>—with both of whom I have
        discussed the matter—that present governmental policy does not provide for or support the
        stirring up or the provision of significant quantities of support to satellite uprisings. I
        have never understood how it is possible to support from outside a satellite country a
        revolt or unrest of any kind which is not sufficiently strong, in and of itself, to unseat
        the government in power. This support can only be provided by armed military forces prepared
        to march to the active assistance of the revolutionists for the purpose of helping them
        complete their attempted coup and providing the strength necessary to consolidate and hold
        their gains. To the best of my knowledge there is no historical precedent for a successful
        revolt in a country where the weight of a large army of a foreign power, supporting the
        existing regime, is either in the country or standing on its borders ready to move. Nor is
        it my understanding that there is any US policy decision in being, nor any adequate US
        forces to back up any such decision, to move in and give support to an attempted
        revolt.</item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item>None of the foregoing is to say that we should not continue to encourage resistance to
        the Soviet satellite regimes in order to keep the pressure on and to retard the
        consolidation of Soviet controls in those areas. This is what I understand our policy
        directives to amount to at the present time, but it is one of the most difficult, unanswered
        questions of the day as to what US or Western policy would be in case of an attempted revolt
        occurring in any of the satellites within the foreseeable future and prior to the withdrawal
        of Soviet military power from the immediate or adjacent area. This is the question which has
        been posed to us repeatedly by European statesmen, of whom <persName>Ernst Reuter</persName>
        was one of the most succinct propounders. You may recall his repeated predictions that there
        would be further outbreaks of unrest, perhaps as early as the Spring of this year, in
        Eastern Germany, and he asked just what the West would propose to do in such event. He
        tended <pb n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0500"/>to answer his own question by speculating
        that we would probably be forced to stand idly by wringing our hands and seeing all
        possibility of future resistance go down in bloody liquidation unless we were able
        meanwhile, through diplomatic action of the most courageous and forceful character, to bring
        about a retraction of Soviet power.</item>

      <p rend="flushleft">Dear <persName corresp="#p_TMGAG1">General Trudeau</persName>:</p>
      <p>In your letter of 24 December 1953<note n="2" xml:id="d168fn2">Not printed. (Ibid., Folder
        24)</note> you suggested that problems relating to clandestine intelligence required a

       “Agreed Activities” paper.</p>
      <p><gloss target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss> #5 is a fundamental statement of policy. Prior to
       its issuance the underlying philosophies and problems were debated at length at all levels in
       the interested offices of the Executive Branch of the Government and by appropriate
       congressional groups. Each formal study of the problem of clandestine intelligence
       operations, after debate of the various views presented, came without exception to an
       acceptance of the principles reflected in <gloss target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss> #5.</p>
      <p>A revision was issued on 28 August 1951<note n="4" xml:id="d168fn4"><ref target="#d255"
         >Document 255</ref>.</note> to meet new conditions arising from the Korean War and the
       establishment of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, but the paper as revised is still a
       statement of basic responsibilities rather than an attempt to spell out the conditions that
       will govern all conceivable relationships and circumstances. There is, however, ample
       flexibility in the concept stated in <gloss target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss> #5 to meet all
       such circumstances, and changing needs can best be met by corollary agreements, based on
        <gloss target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss> #5, which can be readily achieved without calling

      <p>Therefore, rather than seek a change in <gloss target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss> #5, I would
       prefer to pursue the problem of a coordinated program on the basis of the “Agreed Activities”
       paper which representatives of the Armed Services prepared in collaboration with
       representatives of this Agency, in June of last year. We are now awaiting with interest the
       return of this draft agreement which I understand the <gloss target="#t_JIC1">JIC</gloss> ad
       hoc committee dealing with this problem planned to rework on the basis of comments from
       commanders in the field.</p>
      <p>I would therefore urge that you use your influence to bring about early resumption of
       negotiation leading to a final “Agreed Activities” paper.</p>

        <item>The National Security Council, taking cognizance of the vicious covert activities of
         the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Communist China and the governments, parties
         and groups dominated by them (hereinafter collectively referred to as “International
         Communism”) to discredit and defeat the aims and activities of the United States and other
         powers of the free world, determined, as set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
         directives 10/2 and 10/5, that, in the interests of world peace and U.S. national security,
         the overt foreign activities of the U.S. Government should be supplemented by covert
         operations.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>The Central Intelligence Agency had already been charged by the National Security
         Council with conducting espionage and counterespionage operations abroad. It therefore
         seemed desirable, for operational reasons, not to create a new agency for covert
         operations, but, subject to directives from the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>, to
         place the responsibility for them on the Central Intelligence Agency and correlate them
         with espionage and counterespionage operations under the over-all control of the Director
         of Central Intelligence.</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>The <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> has determined that such covert operations
         shall to the greatest extent practicable, in the light of U.S. and Soviet capabilities and
         taking into account the risk of war, be designed to: <list>
          <label>a.</label>
          <item>Create and exploit troublesome problems for International Communism, impair
           relations between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Communist China and
           between them and their satellites, complicate control within the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
            >USSR</gloss>, Communist China and between them and their satellites, and retard the
           growth of the military and economic potential of the Soviet bloc.</item>
          <label>b.</label>
          <item>Discredit the prestige and ideology of International Communism, and reduce the
           strength of its parties and other elements.</item>
          <label>c.</label>
          <item>Counter any threat of a party or individuals directly or indirectly responsive to

          <label>e.</label>
          <item>Strengthen the orientation toward the United States of the peoples and nations of

           dominated or threatened by International Communism, develop underground resistance and
           facilitate covert and guerrilla operations and ensure availability of those forces in the
           event of war, including wherever practicable provisions of a base upon which the military
           may expand these forces in time of war within acting theaters of operations as well as
           provision for stay-behind assets and escape and evasion facilities.</item>

        <item>Under the authority of Section 102(d)(5) of the National Security Act of 1947, the

           Secretary of Defense, that covert operations are planned and conducted in a manner
           consistent with United States foreign and military policies and with overt activities,

          <label>a.</label>
          <item>Plans for covert operations to be conducted in active theaters of war and any other
           areas in which U.S. forces are engaged in combat operations will be drawn up with the
           assistance of the Department of Defense and will be in consonance with and complementary
           to approved war plans of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</item>
          <label>b.</label>
          <item>Covert operations in active theaters of war and any other areas in which U.S. forces

           Defense.</item>
         </list></item>
        <label>6.</label>
        <item>As used in this directive, “covert operations” shall be understood to be all
         activities conducted pursuant to this directive which are so planned and executed that any
         U.S. Government responsibility for them is not evident to unauthorized persons and that if
         uncovered the U.S. Government can plausibly disclaim any responsibility for them.
         Specifically, such operations shall include any covert activities related to: propaganda;
         political action; economic warfare; preventive direct action, including sabotage,
         anti-sabotage, demolition; escape and evasion and evacuation measures; subversion against
         hostile states or groups including assistance to underground resistance movements,
         guerrillas and refugee liberation groups; support of indigenous and anti-communist elements
         in threatened countries of the free world; deception plans and operations; and all
         activities compatible with this <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478" facs="0507"/>directive
         necessary to accomplish the foregoing. Such operations shall not include: armed conflict by
         recognized military forces, espionage and counterespionage, nor cover and deception for
         military operations.</item>
        <label>7.</label>
        <item>This directive supersedes and rescinds <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2 and

        <item>On August 30, 1951, the Council directed that the Director of Central Intelligence, in
         collaboration with the Joint Chiefs of Staff (<gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>), the

        <label>b.</label>
        <item>Under this directive, a Subcommittee headed by Lt. General <persName>Idwal H.
          Edwards</persName> (USAF ret.) completed and submitted to the Council on May 18, 1953 its
         report, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 140/1.<note n="8" xml:id="d173fn8"><gloss

         previous study in that (1) it was projected for two years into the future, through
         mid-1955; (2) in addition to the continental United States, defined key installations
         overseas were considered; (3) instead of using maximum estimates of Soviet strength, as had
         been substantially done before, the evaluation used a probable estimate level in this
         regard, and assumed a Soviet strategy regarded as being consistent with these estimated
         capabilities. The Report was given to the Planning Board’s Continental Defense Committee,
         the so-called <persName>Bull</persName> Committee, and was used by that Committee along
         with other relevant materials in the preparation of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
         159.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>4. The Report of the <persName>Bull</persName> Committee, <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
        >NSC</gloss> 159, July 22, 1953, referred to the substance of the
        <persName>Edwards</persName> Report (para. 9), and also considered in some detail the
       problem of permanent organization (paras. 129–131) recommending that a new evaluation be
       undertaken in two phases, the first covering Soviet attack capabilities—to be done jointly by
       the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>—and the
       second covering damage, or vulnerability to the estimated attack capabilities—to be done by a
       separate Committee under <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> direction. <gloss
        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 159, para. 30, further noted that the Council “might well wish
       to establish a permanent subcommittee on <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0512"/>‘Net
       Capabilities Estimates’ composed of the Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>

      <p>5. Concurrently, the question of net evaluations in general was considered by The
       President’s Committee on International Information Activities, the <persName

       June 30, 1953, the <persName corresp="#p_JCD1">Jackson</persName> Committee specifically
       recommended that machinery for the preparation of such evaluations should be created.<note

      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Importance of the Net Evaluation</hi></p>
      <p>6. In view of the usefulness of the <persName>Edwards</persName> Report and the subsequent
       recommendations of the <persName>Bull</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_JCD1"
        >Jackson</persName> Committees, the importance and desirability of continuing net
       evaluations of Soviet capability to injure the United States may be regarded as established.
       For purposes of Council consideration of problems relating to continental defense or the
       defense of US installations overseas, it is meaningless to have gross estimates of Soviet
       nuclear capabilities, air strength, etc., unless these are merged with existing US and Allied
       defensive capabilities so as to produce an evaluation of the net Soviet capability, present
       and prospective.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Organizational Problems</hi></p>
      <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Method of Operation</hi>. Experience with the 1951–52 project
       demonstrated emphatically that it was not satisfactory to conduct a net evaluation on the
       basis of one-shot contributions by several agencies, melded by one agency or by a group. The
        <persName>Edwards</persName> Subcommittee operated on the basis of continuing exchange of
       material by a tightly-knit operating group producing in effect “successive approximations”
       leading to a final refined product. Wherever the responsibility may be placed, and on
       whatever basis agencies participate, this method of operation is essential. Moreover, this
       method of operation can also be employed—as it was by the <persName>Edwards</persName>
       group—to minimize the security problem involved in the handling of sensitive information that
       must be supplied particularly by <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss>.</p>
      <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Allocation of Responsibility</hi>. Three allocations have so far been
       tried or proposed. <hi rend="italic">The <persName>Edwards</persName> Subcommittee</hi>
       consisted of a Chairman appointed by the Council (General <persName>Edwards</persName> was
       actually nominated by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>), and representatives of <gloss
        target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, the <gloss
        target="#t_ICIS1">ICIS</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_IIC1">IIC</gloss>. Other <pb n="484"
        xml:id="pg_484" facs="0513"/>agencies, notably <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> and FCDA,
       were in the position of contributors and advisors, but did not participate in the final work
       of the Subcommittee. <hi rend="italic">The <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 159
        recommendation</hi> would divide the work into two stages, with <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
        >JCS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> acting jointly in the first, and with
       the second, or damage, stage handled by an ad hoc committee chaired by an <gloss
        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> representative and including Defense, <gloss target="#t_ICIS1"
        >ICIS</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_IIC1">IIC</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> and
       FCDA. <hi rend="italic">The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> views on <gloss
         target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 159</hi>, submitted to the Council on September 1, 1953, take
       the position that the Department of Defense has adequate resources in conjunction with “other
       agencies,” to prepare the needed evaluation without resort to additional machinery. This
       appears to mean that primary responsibility should be placed solely in Defense, with power to
       call on other agencies as needed. The great difference between these three methods
       illustrates the complexity of the problem of allocating responsibility so as to bring in all
       interested agencies to an appropriate degree and at the same time to have a workable set-up.
       The following points appear relevant: <list>
        <label>a.</label>

         from various scales and types of attack (Defense, <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss>, FCDA
         principally). None of these can be considered in isolation. To illustrate, the Soviet
         attack strategy would be based in part on the Soviet estimate of US weaknesses and gaps in
         defense, and in part also on the Soviet estimate of the degree of damage that might be
          inflicted.<note n="11" xml:id="d173fn11">[<hi rend="italic">5 lines not
          declassified</hi>.] [Footnote in the original.]</note> Hence, it becomes necessary to take
         theoretical possibilities of attack and “war-game” them through from a Soviet standpoint.
         In theory at least, this could not be done properly without constant and full participation
         of all interested agencies.</item>
        <label>b.</label>
        <item>On the other hand, such a multi-agency exercise is on its face impractical and
         endlessly time-consuming. Some compromise must be struck, as was done in setting up the
          <persName>Edwards</persName> Subcommittee.</item>
        <label>c.</label>
        <item>It is readily possible to separate out the elements relating to US vulnerability in
         terms of damage. Moreover, although, as indicated in a above these are theoretically
         interlinked with Soviet strategy, in practice damage estimates based on assumed
         hypothetical levels of attack would be adequate, since in any event such estimates would be
         “broad-brush” in character. Thus it is reasonable to separate out the damage aspect, and
         charge this phase to a separate group.</item>
        <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0514"/>
        <label>d.</label>
        <item>However, it appears neither logical nor practicable to combine that damage aspect with
         the internal security aspect for which <gloss target="#t_ICIS1">ICIS</gloss> and <gloss
          target="#t_IIC1">IIC</gloss> are primarily responsible. The principal internal security
         problem belongs in the “capabilities” rather than the “damage” category, since it concerns
         Soviet clandestine introduction of nuclear or other weapons. Thus, the
          <persName>Edwards</persName> Subcommittee setup was logical on this point. As a practical
         matter, the internal security agencies are believed to have felt that the
          <persName>Edwards</persName> and <persName>Bull</persName> Reports placed at too low a
         level the likelihood of Soviet employment of clandestine capabilities. However, assuming
         the internal security agencies have produced an estimate of the likelihood of detection if
         the Soviets used clandestine means, the ultimate question of whether the Soviets would be
         prepared to take this risk is certainly one of basic Soviet strategy involving broader
         considerations than those for which the internal security agencies are responsible. The
         split shown by Mr. <persName>McDonnell</persName>’s dissent to <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
          >NSC</gloss> 159 cannot be remedied by any organizational changes, although of course the

         the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, speaking as the representative of the services,
         for military advice. Thus, the President and Council can best receive guidance in the most
         useful and complete form through an effective amalgamation of the functions of the

      <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Personnel and Facilities</hi>. If it is accepted that a tightly-knit

       become important. In the case of the <persName>Edwards</persName> Subcommittee, these were
       handled by the furnishing of facilities in the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> area of
       the Department of Defense and by the furnishing of secretarial and other personnel by the

      <p>11. The <persName>Edwards</persName> Subcommittee completed its work in four months, but
       found that this was too short a period in which to go into all of the important aspects. The
        <persName>Edwards</persName> Subcommittee had particular difficulty with the question of
       Soviet strategy in the event of war, whether the Soviets would allocate the bulk of their
       stockpile to the US or a large part of it against non-US targets. A successor group may find
       it desirable to submit this question to thorough intelligence consideration, based on the
       material on capabilities and damage developed by the group. This question was referred to by
       General <persName>Edwards</persName> in a personal memorandum to the Executive Secretary,
        <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>, dated 19 May 1953.<note n="14" xml:id="d173fn14"
        >General <persName>Edwards</persName>’ memorandum to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
        Executive Secretary, May 19, provided comments by the Special Evaluation Subcommittee
        concerning future evaluations of the Soviet Union’s net capabilities to damage the United
        States. (National Archives, RG 273, Policy Papers, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 140,
        Box 56)</note> General <persName>Edwards</persName> also referred to the desirability of
       covering the extent of strategic warning that might be expected, of a vulnerability study,
       and of a psychological study of the effects on the people of the US of assumed levels of
       atomic attacks. In view of the complexity of these problems, it appears highly desirable that
       the new study be allowed at least six months, and if possible longer, for completion.</p>
      <p>12. To allow six months or more for a new evaluation would throw the completion after 1
       October 1954, and would eliminate its usefulness as a supporting element for work on the
        <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 budget. However, this disadvantage appears outweighed
       by the considerations stated in paragraph 11.</p>
      <p>13. <hi rend="italic">Scope</hi>. The <persName>Edwards</persName> Report considered not
       only the continental United States but also key US installations outside the US, considered
       in terms of the usefulness of such installations to US counteroffensive action. There was
       some difficulty about the definition of such overseas installations, leading to a
       misunderstanding affecting the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> submission. Apart from
       avoiding a repetition of this, the scope of the <persName>Edwards</persName> Report appeared
       workable.</p>
      <p>14. <hi rend="italic">Projection</hi>. The <persName>Edwards</persName> Report projected
       its conclusions forward for two years, and General <persName>Edwards</persName> recommended
       that future studies adopt a projection period not greater than this. For planning purposes it
       would be desirable to have a longer projection period, since many policy decisions cannot
       bear fruit for three or more years. However, from a working standpoint, it would be extremely
       difficult to get a firm enough picture of either Soviet or US capabilities, in order to do
        <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0516"/>the “war-gaming” exercise. The Planning Board
       should consider whether the policy considerations should outweigh working difficulties and
       limitations.</p>

      <p>I am writing this memorandum with reference to the policy, recommended by the National
       Security Council and approved by the President, for increasing observation of Soviet Bloc
       diplomatic representatives, including personnel with international organizations, while
       within the continental United States, with special reference to those whose activities are
       suspected to extend beyond the scope of normal diplomatic assignments. This policy was most

        351, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5408.</note> As you know, the President has
       approved this program being undertaken by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
      <p>It is our opinion that it may be very helpful to our activities outside of the United
       States to have such a selective surveillance intensified within the United States, and that
       such a program may have a potential in the field of foreign intelligence information which
       could be exploited on a continuing basis. The individuals who would be under surveillance are
       in this country temporarily and eventually will depart for their own or other countries.
       Information and leads derived from this program would be of assistance to the Central
       Intelligence Agency in carrying out its responsibilities with regard to this class of persons
       outside the United States.</p>
      <p>We understand that the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s budget for Fiscal Year 1955, which
       has been approved by the Bureau of the Budget and is before the committees of the Congress,
       made no provision for this increased activity and contains no funds which can be allocated to
       its support. Because a program for observation of foreign diplomats is one of considerable
       sensitivity, it is not considered desirable to reopen the Bureau’s budget for Fiscal Year
       1955, which is now before the Congress, in view of the obviously attendant publicity. We <pb
        n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0518"/>are, therefore, proposing, because of our interest in
       developing this program on an experimental basis, that the Central Intelligence Agency make
       available during Fiscal Year 1955 to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, funds from its
       Contingency Reserve up to an amount to bring the program to the full stage of development
       considered desirable by the <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> by the end of Fiscal Year
       1955; [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>].</p>
      <p>If the program is deemed successful during the course of its development in Fiscal Year
       1955, it is understood that the Federal Bureau of Investigation would provide for the entire
       activity for Fiscal Year 1956 and thereafter in its regular budget requests to the Congress,
       and would continue to make available to the Central Intelligence Agency the information and
       leads derived from thereafter carrying out the program which would be of assistance to the
       Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
      <p>The Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs has explained to the
       President how this matter is to be arranged. Your approval of this proposal is, accordingly,
        requested.<note n="3" xml:id="d174fn3">A March 15 letter from <persName corresp="#p_DJM1"

        Council, on the basis of this paper as issued, how materials available to the <gloss
         target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> and Government agencies may be provided to the Watch Committee
        in connection with performing its mission and functions.</p>
       <p>4. It was brought out by discussion of proposed changes to the draft terms of reference
        that it is desirable sharply to focus the watch function as one of providing maximum prior
        warning of the imminence of hostile action. At the same time, the watch machinery must have
        unrestricted access to a great variety of materials in order to perform that function.
        Experience has shown that without such access, and without recognition of the high priority
        to be accorded the watch process, that process tends to become static.</p>
       <p>5. Various members commented on the subordinate relation of the Watch Committee to the
         <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss>. It was recognized that the Watch Committee could
        present to the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> any problem, substantive or procedural,
        affecting its operation and that the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss>’s review of the
        Watch Committee’s operation would tend to prevent the development of misunderstanding as to
        the Watch function or product.</p>
       <p>6. It was understood that the proposed approach to field intelligence activities would
        include non-military as well as military activities.</p>

       <label>1.</label>
       <item>In the meeting which started at 3 P. M., Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
         >Dulles</persName> explained his purpose by stating that he was hopeful that the Director
        of Central Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff could by exchanging
        views come to an agreement on the proposal for proper “Organizational Arrangements for
        Continental Defense.”</item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> noted the divergence of judgments
        between the Joint Chiefs of Staff and others on one side, and <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
         >CIA</gloss> and others on the other side as indicated in the two solutions (alternatives A
        and B of para. 9 to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action 873–d)<note n="2"
         xml:id="d176fn2">See <ref target="#d173fn2">footnote 2, Document 173</ref>.</note>
        recommended in papers relating to the “Net capabilities of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
         >USSR</gloss> to inflict damage on the US,” which is now up for resolution by the <gloss
         target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>. He felt that this discussion today could clear up some
        misapprehension and lead to an agreed view.</item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> explained that there was a dual
        responsibility shared equally by the Director of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and the
         <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> for advising the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> on
        the intelligence and operational features respectively of an appraisal of the net
        capabilities of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to inflict direct injury on the
        US. He noted that other agencies would have responsibility also but only in limited areas
        requiring only part time participation to the extent necessary to insure that their
        responsibilities are fully met but not to the extent requiring a disclosure of war plans, or
        the extensive use of other highly secret documents. He emphasized also that <gloss
         target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> participation would be on a very limited high level basis, and
        that the few <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> representatives involved would be
        professional men who could be trusted to protect all information made available to them. He
        did not expect that revelation of war plans as such would be found necessary but that
        operational information would be required. He pointed out that he could not carry out his
        full responsibility as <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> without such knowledge of our own
        capabilities.</item>
       <pb n="494" xml:id="pg_494" facs="0523"/>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> replied that he frankly didn’t
        understand why there was any necessity for this high level organization to make a commanders
        estimate. He felt that if <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> made its coordinated
        intelligence estimate, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and the Defense Department
        were, with this estimate available, competent to do the rest of the evaluation for the
         <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> and the President, based on their own knowledge of and
        responsibility for operational matters and war plans. He saw no need for setting up another
        coordinating agency. He didn’t see this need as recently carried out in the Continental
        Defense field.</item>
       <label>5.</label>
       <item>General <persName>Bull</persName> pointed out that a single intelligence estimate of
        gross capabilities was not the final word on intelligence—that it was necessary to work by
        phases in a process of comparing gross intelligence estimates with our operational
        capabilities. This procedure would result in new intelligence estimates based on a knowledge
        of our own strengths and dispositions such as the <persName>Kremlin</persName> is believed
        to have to guide its decisions. This knowledge is not now available to our own national
        intelligence agency. Such a procedure for comparing capabilities on both sides, we believe,
        is essential and is a shared responsibility of <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> and
        Defense.</item>
       <label>6.</label>
       <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> again emphasized that he did not want
        to pry into those areas of classified information not essential to carrying out his
        responsibility and stated that although the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> planning for
        developing the net evaluation was stated as urgent he would not press for action at the next
         <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting pending further consideration by <persName
         corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>.</item>
       <label>7.</label>
       <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARJ1">Amory</persName> called <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
         >Admiral Radford</persName>’s attention to the fact that since no defense can be perfect,
        there will always be a portion of any major attacking force that will get through. This
        hostile force, representing the remaining net capability of the enemy at that time, retains
        a capability for attack. It continues to be the Director’s responsibility to evaluate this
        capability as it was his responsibility before and during the operation.</item>
       <label>8.</label>
       <item>In response to <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>’s expressed
        desire to give it more thought, the Director, in leaving, stated he would be pleased to
        discuss the problem further and felt sure they could work it out.</item>

       <item>In addition to the point that we have been making that the <gloss target="#t_DCI1"
         >DCI</gloss> has a <hi rend="italic">legal responsibility</hi> to advise the Commander (and
        his <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>) on his intelligence estimates of both gross and net
        capabilities, probable intentions and probable courses of action, there are much more potent
        arguments in favor of joint intelligence operational consideration as follows: <list>
         <label>a.</label>
         <item><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> and others infer that all
          they need is the normal estimate of <hi rend="italic">gross capabilities</hi> which they
          in the Defense Department can then use in working out the net capabilities. This view is
          not only an oversimplification of the problem but it puts the Director in the position of
          abdicating his responsibilities for estimating for “The Commander” the Bloc’s probable <hi
           rend="italic">intentions and probable courses of action</hi>. This the Director <hi
           rend="italic">cannot do</hi> in a satisfactory and useful manner in a vacuum, <hi
           rend="italic">excluded from knowledge</hi> of our <hi rend="italic">own deployments and
           our own capabilities</hi>. If the Director’s estimates are done in this manner he is
          asked to estimate the thinking of the <persName>Kremlin</persName> leaders which is based
          on their intelligence of our capabilities which they most certainly know in great detail,
          whereas the Director in his estimate is permitted to have no such comparable knowledge.
          The Director’s knowledge of US and allied capabilities and dispositions must be at least
          comparable to the intelligence possessed by the <persName>Kremlin</persName> leadership.
          To think, as I believe <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> and the
          military in general do, that the Commander’s estimate is made by G–3 after receiving a
           <gloss target="#t_G21">G–2</gloss> contribution overlooks the sound procedures which
          govern all good staff operations in the <gloss target="#t_G21">G–2</gloss>/G–3
          field.</item>
         <label>b.</label>
         <item>No <gloss target="#t_G21">G–2</gloss> makes his estimates of enemy capabilities,
          probable courses of action, or probable intentions or advises his Commander in an
          operational vacuum. By the closest hour by hour contact and joint daily or more frequent
          briefings, he is always able to make his estimate of probable hostile courses of action
          based on not only the enemy new <pb n="496" xml:id="pg_496" facs="0525"/>capabilities in
          manpower, weapons, organization, training, leadership, dispositions, etc. but also from
          his estimate of what the enemy probably knows concerning our own strengths, dispositions
          and intentions.</item>
         <label>c.</label>
         <item>The Director as our National <gloss target="#t_G21">G–2</gloss> should have the same
          rights and duties as any <gloss target="#t_G21">G–2</gloss> in the lower echelons has.
          Otherwise he cannot fulfill his legal responsibilities.</item>
        </list></item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item><p>Although I recognize that a case can be made that the “national level” presents
         different problems with a justified restriction on revelation of war plans, certain planned
         courses of action, certain dispositions, weapons development, etc. should be made available
         to <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> on a very
         strict “need-to-know” basis, I believe a clear definition of intelligence requirements in
         the operational field could be worked out jointly and I doubt that a knowledge of detailed
         war plans would be necessary. In general, <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> should get
         only operational information which it is reasonable to expect the enemy to have in whole or
         in part.</p>
        <p>We have no present mechanism to meet our minimum needs. We are blocked by self imposed
         departmental restrictions or ground rules which severely limit our intelligence
         investigation of our own force—a handicap not imposed on our enemies.</p></item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>I want to point out also from my experience a real stumbling block in getting Defense
        to accept our proposal. That is, the broadening of the responsible group to include other
        agencies such as <gloss target="#t_IIC1">IIC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ICIS1"
         >ICIS</gloss> who have a similar justification for full responsibility in their more
        limited field—hostile attack on the Continental US by Soviet agents. Their exclusion from
        overall responsibility can be justified on practical grounds only but I think it must be
        done to make the joint effort work. I think it might be acceptable to insure them the right
        and duty to be heard at appropriate times and to comment on the final report or at least
        segments thereof that bear in any way on their responsible interests. I believe you should
        support the probable Defense Department desire to exclude them but to do so on a practical
        basis related to their total lack of <hi rend="italic">responsibility</hi> in the fields of
        foreign intelligence and foreign deployments and war plans which quite rightly should be
        kept on a strict “need-to-know”. They will resist as we have but I believe the exclusion can
        be justified on grounds acceptable to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>.</item>

       concurred in a proposal to allocate additional funds to support a series of projects designed
       to encourage ratification of the European Defense Community. This proposal, originating with
       the Department of State, is based on the view that activities in this request to date have
       been useful but need to be accelerated to the extent practicable. The acceleration and the
       additional allocation of funds would be designed to support EDC ratification through such
       media as the press, radio, speeches, labor groups, etc.</p>
      <p>The Board concurred in a request [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]
       to the Director of the Budget for an allocation of such additional funds as may be necessary

           the Government if necessary, and</item>
          <label>b.</label>
          <item>Directed that the Operations Coordinating Board agree upon principles which will
           govern such unattributed activities (hereinafter such activities are included in the
           definition of gray).</item>
         </list></p>
        <p>These principles, having been agreed upon by the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>, are
         published herewith for the guidance of officials concerned.</p></item>
       <label>1.2</label>
       <item>The intent of this paper is to underline the need for field coordination, to insure
        that all information activities are conducted <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0531"
        />securely and effectively, to prevent duplication and to avoid embarrassment to the U.S.
        Government. Responsibilities in the white and black fields are clearly established, but in
        the gray field responsibility has been assigned to more than one agency. Therefore, this
        paper concerns itself primarily with the criteria to use in determining whether <gloss
         target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> or the Department of State or the <gloss target="#t_OCB1"
         >OCB</gloss> designee will undertake a particular gray activity. Thus to carry out fully
        the intent of this paper, there must be close liaison in the field among representatives of
        the agencies concerned so that each item of gray activity will be considered in light of: <list>
         <label>a.</label>
         <item>The assignments of responsibility and the criteria set forth in Paragraph 3.</item>
         <label>b.</label>
         <item>The merits of the case, assets available, and other considerations which may apply
          locally.</item>
        </list></item>
       <label>1.3</label>
       <item>Chiefs of Diplomatic Missions or Principal Officers (the ranking State Department
        official at a subordinate post) have the overall responsibility for insuring that field
        coordination at all posts for which they have supervisory responsibility is satisfactory
        (Paragraph 4.2). Moreover, State and <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> both at
        headquarters and in the field will be responsible for initiating liaison with the <gloss
         target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> designee concerning their respective gray activities, so that
        the latter knows of existing or contemplated activities and can preserve the security of its

        <cell rendition="#top"><hi rend="italic">White</hi></cell>
        <cell>Acknowledged as an official statement or act of the U.S. Government, or emanates from
         a source associated closely enough with the U.S. Government to reflect an official
         viewpoint. The information is true and factual. It also includes all output identified as
         coming from U.S. official sources.</cell>
       </row>
       <row>
        <cell rendition="#top"><hi rend="italic">Gray</hi></cell>
        <cell>The true source (U.S. Government) is not revealed to the target audience. The activity
         engaged in plausibly appears to emanate from a non-official American source, or an
         indigenous, non-hostile source, or there may be no attribution.<note n="3" xml:id="d181fn3"
          >In areas where activity is conducted without any attribution and it may result in
          embarrassment to an agency of the U.S. Government, liaison officers will carefully weigh
          all aspects of the proposed activity before deciding whether such an operation should be
          undertaken. [Footnote in the original.]</note>
         <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> is that information whose content is such that

         American participation <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0532"/>are not revealed. It is
         simply a means for the U.S. to present viewpoints which are in the interest of U.S. foreign
         policy, but which will be acceptable or more acceptable to the intended target audience
         than will an official government statement.</cell>

        <cell>The activity engaged in appears to emanate from a source (government, party, group,

         concealed and the U.S. Government would deny responsibility. The content may be partially
         or completely fabricated, but that which is fabricated is made to appear credible to the
         target audience. Black activity is also usually designed to cause embarrassment to the

       <label>3.1</label>
       <item>Since the responsibility is assigned for gray activity to more than one agency, liaison
        officers in the field, and in Washington whenever necessary, must determine which agency
        will undertake an activity. The inherent risk must be assessed by means of criteria set
        forth in Paragraph 3.4, bearing in mind that activities in which <gloss target="#t_USIA1"
         >USIA</gloss> or State engage must be those which the U.S. Government could acknowledge if
        necessary.</item>
       <label>3.2</label>
       <item>Authorized to engage in white activity directed at foreign audiences are: The State
        Department, <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>, the Foreign Operations Administration (as
        assigned in Reorganization Plans 7 and 8) the Defense Department and other U.S. Government
        departments and agencies as necessary.</item>
       <label>3.3</label>
       <item>Responsibility for engaging in black propaganda and other related activities is
        assigned solely to the designee of the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>. Likewise it
        should be kept in mind that activities, either gray or black, conducted into denied areas
        from their peripheries, other than radio, are the sole responsibility of the <gloss

       <label>3.4</label>
       <item>Responsibility for gray is assigned to the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>
        designee, <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> and State. The following criteria will
        assist in determining the responsibility for the execution of a proposed gray activity. If
        the answer to any of the three questions below is affirmative, the activity is the sole
        responsibility of the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> designee. If government interest
        is not to be revealed but the answer to all three questions listed below is negative, the
        activity may fall within the charter of State, <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> or the

         <label>b.</label>

       <label>3.5</label>
       <item>The Department of State and <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> may engage in gray
        activity which can be acknowledged by the U.S. Government if necessary, provided that before
        a decision or commitment is made, the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> designee’s
        representative, wherever one is stationed, is consulted and his concurrence obtained.
        Concurrence shall be given unless the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> designee is of the
        opinion that a proposed operation will jeopardize its activities or established mechanisms,
        or does not comply with the criteria in 3.4. In giving its concurrence the <gloss
         target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> designee is not assuming responsibility for the successful
        completion of an activity conducted by another agency. Necessary coordination between State
        and <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>
        designee will be undertaken through liaison channels described in paragraph 4. Wherever the

      <list>
       <label>1.</label>
       <item>Pursuant to authorization of the President there is hereby directed the preparation of
        a report assessing the net capabilities of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, in the
        event of general war, to inflict direct injury upon the continental United States and key
        U.S. installations overseas. This net capabilities report will cover the period through July
        1, 1957 and should be submitted to the Council on or before November 1, 1954. It will cover
        all types of attack, direct or clandestine, and will deal primarily with the initial phases
        of war, i.e., the period during which all or most of the Soviet stockpile of nuclear weapons
        might be expended. It will <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0535"/>include consideration of
        the several courses of action which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is capable of
        executing and in support of which the Soviet nuclear weapons stockpile might be expended. In
        determining the net effect of an attack, the report will take into account the mid-1957
        status of presently approved defense programs.</item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>In order to carry out this directive, there is hereby established a Net Capabilities

       Board. The functions of the Psychological Operations Coordinating Committee, established
       pursuant to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 59/1, were transferred by the President by a
       special memorandum to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> dated September 3, 1953,<note

        >POCC</gloss> has been discontinued as a separate coordinating arrangement. <gloss
        target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> arrangements for former <gloss target="#t_POCC1">POCC</gloss>
       functions are described in Annex “A”.<note n="8" xml:id="d183fn8">Entitled “Interagency
        Liaison with U.S. Information Agency,” dated June 28. Not printed.</note></p>
      <p>2. The <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> has noted with approval certain interagency
       relationships and arrangements as indicated in Annex “A”. It is considered that these
       arrangements will serve the requirements of interdepartmental coordination of international
       information activities until such time and under such conditions of hostilities as the
       President may otherwise direct. In the event that the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> in
       its consideration of over-all policy and organizational arrangements with respect to
       prescribed theaters of war determines that an information and psychological warfare
       arrangement may be required different from that set forth in Annex “A”, the <gloss
        target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> when directed by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>, will
       develop specific recommendations for its consideration.</p>
      <p>3. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 127/1, approved by the National Security Council on
       July 24, 1952, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action No. 657, concurred in a plan for
       conducting psychological operations during general hostilities submitted by the Psychological
       Strategy Board, subject to two modifications: <list>
        <label>a.</label>
        <item>Overt information facilities and personnel in military theaters of operations were to
         be made available to the U.S. military commander designated by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
          >JCS</gloss> during a period of hostilities. Determination of the facilities and personnel
         so transferred and their later return were to be coordinated by the Psychological Strategy
         Board.</item>
        <label>b.</label>
        <item>Subsequently, the responsibility for the determination was placed upon the
         organization established pursuant to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 59/1.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>4. The President approved <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 127/1 as a basis for
       emergency planning related to sudden general hostilities and directed that subsidiary plans
       and measures should provide maximum flexibility for the President in determining the ultimate
       organization required for full scale general hostilities.</p>
      <p>5. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 127/1 was designed for a period of full mobilization
       or general hostilities and therefore did not apply to the hostilities in Korea. Subsequent to
       the approval of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 127/1, the President on March 12, 1953
       assigned responsibility to the <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> and the Bureau of the <pb
        n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0538"/>Budget, under the coordination of the President’s
       Advisory Committee on Reorganization, for the development of a plan of organization for full
       mobilization required for general hostilities. No specific plan related to information and
       psychological warfare activities has yet been developed. The <gloss target="#t_OCB1"
        >OCB</gloss> apparently has no responsibility under <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
       127/1 for any aspects of this planning.</p>
      <p>6. A <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> contingency plan, D–11b, “National Overt
       Propaganda Policy Guidance for General War,”<note n="9" xml:id="d183fn9">Not found.</note> is

        >OCB</gloss> will refer it for revision or other disposal by the appropriate authority as
       indicated by the plan of organization for full mobilization (par. 5 above) when provisions
       for information and psychological warfare activities have been developed and approved.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Recommendation</hi></p>
      <p>It is recommended:</p>
      <p>7. That the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>, recognizing that the organizational
       aspects of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 59/1 and <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>

      <p rend="flushleft">Dear <persName corresp="#p_DGJ1">General Doolittle</persName>:</p>
      <p>I have requested you, and you have agreed, to act as Chairman of a panel of consultants to
       conduct a study of the covert activities of the Central Intelligence Agency. With your
       concurrence I have invited Messrs. <persName>William B. Franke</persName>, <persName>Morris
        Hadley</persName>, and <persName>William Pawley</persName> to act with you as members of the
       panel. Mr. <persName>S. Paul Johnston</persName> has kindly agreed to serve as Executive
       Director of the panel.</p>
      <p>It is my desire that the Panel of Consultants should undertake a comprehensive study of the
       covert activities of the Central Intelligence Agency, in particular those carried out under
       the terms of <gloss target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss> #5 <pb n="511" xml:id="pg_511"
        facs="0540"/>of August 28, 1951,<note n="2" xml:id="d185fn2"><ref target="#d255">Document
         255</ref>.</note> and <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5412 of March 15, 1954.<note
        n="3" xml:id="d185fn3"><ref target="#d171">Document 171</ref>.</note> You will consider the
       personnel factors, the security, the adequacy, the efficacy and the relative costs of these
       operations and, as far as possible, equate the cost of the over-all efforts to the results
       achieved. You will make any recommendations calculated to improve the conduct of these
       operations. To the extent that agencies of the Government, other than the Central
       Intelligence Agency, are engaged in covert operations which may parallel, duplicate, or
       supplement the operations of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, you may investigate such
       other operations conducted by any other department or agency of the Government in order to
       insure, insofar as practicable, that the field of foreign clandestine operations is
       adequately covered and that there is no unnecessary duplication of effort or expense.</p>
      <p>In view of the particularly sensitive nature of these covert operations, their relation to
       the conduct of our foreign policy, and the fact that these sensitive operations are carried
       on pursuant to National Security Council action approved by me, I desire that your report be
       made to me personally and classified Top Secret. I will determine whether or not the report
       or any part thereof should have any further dissemination. I should appreciate it if your
       report could be available to me prior to October 1, 1954.</p>
      <p>As you know, the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government,
       generally known as the <persName corresp="#p_HH1">Hoover</persName> Commission, is
       constituting a Task Force to study and make recommendations with respect to the organization
       and methods of operations of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.<note n="4"
        xml:id="d185fn4">See <ref target="#d184">Documents 184</ref>, <ref target="#d220">220</ref>,

       <persName corresp="#p_CGRM1">General Mark W. Clark</persName> has been designated by Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_HH1">Hoover</persName> to head this Task Force which, I understand,
       will probably be organized and start its work sometime in September next. Under the law
       constituting the <persName corresp="#p_HH1">Hoover</persName> Commission, the Task Force
       shall study and investigate the present organization and methods of operation of the Agency
       to determine what changes therein are necessary to accomplish the policy of Congress to
       promote economy, efficiency, and improved service by: <list>

      <p>As the work of the <persName corresp="#p_HH1">Hoover</persName> Task Force will get under
       way shortly, I suggest that you and <persName corresp="#p_CGRM1">General Clark</persName>
       confer in order to avoid any unnecessary duplication of work as between you. The distinction
       between the work of your Study Group and of the <persName corresp="#p_HH1">Hoover</persName>
       Task Force is this: <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>You will deal with the covert activities of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> as
         indicated in paragraph (2) above, and your report will be submitted to me. <persName
          corresp="#p_CGRM1">General Clark</persName>’s Task Force will deal largely with the
         organization and methods of operation of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and other
         related agencies within the limits prescribed in the law as outlined in paragraph (4)
         above. Reports of the <persName corresp="#p_HH1">Hoover</persName> Commission are made to
         the Congress.</p></quote></p>
      <p>The purpose of these studies, both that of the <persName corresp="#p_HH1">Hoover</persName>
       Task Force and that of your Group, is to insure that the United States Government develops an
       appropriate mechanism for carrying out its over-all intelligence responsibilities and the
       related covert operations. I consider these operations are essential to our national security
       in these days when international Communism is aggressively pressing its worldwide subversive
       program.</p>

         copy of <gloss target="#t_DCID1">DCID</gloss> 1/2 is attached. (National Archives, RG 273,
         Official Minutes, 1947–1961, 209th Meeting, Box 42)</note> recommending that the President
        direct all appropriate departments and agencies of the government to keep the Intelligence
        Advisory Committee (<gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss>) Watch Committee informed concerning
        diplomatic, political, military, or other courses of action by the United States,
        contemplated or in process of execution, which might bring about military reaction or early
        hostile action by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, or its allies, endangering the
        security of the United States. The Director of Central Intelligence further recommends that
        all information and intelligence pertinent to its mission, without restriction because of
        source, policy or operational sensitivity, be made available to the Watch Committee.</item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>The directive recommended by the Director of Central Intelligence is not interpreted to
        mean that either the Watch Committee or the National Indications Center (<gloss
         target="#t_NIC1">NIC</gloss>) will be furnished U.S. War Plans because under the present
        policy the United States will not initiate hostilities with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
         >USSR</gloss> or its allies.</item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>The Joint Chiefs of Staff recognize that this directive will make available to the
        Watch Committee information on operations of a very sensitive nature that should be strictly
        maintained in a “need-to-know” status to reduce danger of disclosure to a minimum. However,
        the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that knowledge of such sensitive operations must be
        provided the Watch Committee if it is to carry out its mission of providing early warning to
        the United States of hostile action by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, or its
        allies, which endangers the security of the United States. Therefore, the Joint Chiefs of
        Staff recommend that the Secretary of Defense support the recommendation of the Director of
        Central Intelligence in principle.</item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item>The method recommended by the Director of Central Intelligence by which the information
        is transmitted to the Watch Committee and its subordinate organization, the National
        Indications Center, and the handling of such information by that Committee and Center
        thereafter requires clarification to make it more precise. Also, to ensure that the Services
        will not be expected to furnish the Watch Committee with a myriad of small details of
        operations, the transmission and handling of which would overload the Service organizations
        as well as the <gloss target="#t_NIC1">NIC</gloss>, it is considered that the governmental
        departments and agencies should be required to furnish the <gloss target="#t_NIC1"
         >NIC</gloss> only with the information which they believe to be of sufficient importance to
        cause military reaction or early hostile action by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
        >USSR</gloss>, or its allies.</item>
       <label>5.</label>
       <item><p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff therefore recommend that you support the recommendations
         of the Director of Central Intelligence as modified by the changes below (changes to the

        transmitting and using this information. They consider that this method should be developed
        by the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss>, which is the agency responsible for the Watch
        function. Furthermore, the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider it extremely important that
        information of action to be taken by the United States not be transmitted until the action
        is approved for immediate implementation. If a directive on this subject should provide
        otherwise, the strategic planning of the United States would be given an undesirable
        dissemination. To further insure against undesirable dissemination, the recommendation of
        the Joint Chiefs of Staff includes a provision that information of an operational nature is
        for exclusive use within the Watch Committee.</item>

        Action No. 1195, below.</note>
      </p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> said that an effort was being made
       to improve the intelligence mechanism for providing early warning of a possible attack. An
       indication center was being set up under the Watch Committee to study all possible items
       which might alert us to danger. This center would need to have not only foreign intelligence,
       but also information on U.S. policies which might produce hostile reactions in enemy
       countries. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> felt that it would be unwise to
       adopt the formula suggested by the Defense agencies, to the effect that the Watch Committee
       would be kept informed only of those U.S. policies which in the judgment of the agency
       passing on the information might bring about hostile enemy reaction.</p>
      <p>The President said the only purpose of these arrangements was to get the right information
       to the people who had to study it. He would not want a lot of inconsequential information to
       be passed on to the Watch Committee. He suggested that significant information on U.S.
       policies might be transmitted to the Watch Committee.</p>
      <p>The Attorney General felt that the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> recommendations
       tended to set up a kind of supervision over the <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss>. He
       requested assurance that adoption of these recommendations would require no change in <gloss
        target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> methods or operations. He asked whether <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss> was not now receiving all the information it needed. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> said he did not know, because he did not know what
       information was being held back.</p>
      <p>The President called attention to paragraph 2-c of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
       recommendations. He said that decision as to withholding information from the Watch Committee
       should be referred to him only if the Director of Central Intelligence and the other agency
       involved disagreed. He reiterated his desire that the Watch Committee get all the information
       that could be of real use to it, and suggested that the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
       recommendations, as amended at the meeting, be adopted subject to the Director of Central
       Intelligence and the Director of the <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> agreeing on
       editorial changes not affecting the substance.</p>

        taken at its 207th meeting, July 22, the Council noted the President’s request that the
        Bureau of the Budget prepare recommendations regarding responsibility for coordination of
        economic warfare activities. (National Archives, RG 59, S/S–<gloss target="#t_NSC1"
         >NSC</gloss> (Miscellaneous) Files: Lot 66 D 95, Records of Action by the National Security
        Council)</note></p>
      <p>Discussion of this question arose in connection with Item 6 below, “The Foreign Information
       Program and Psychological Warfare Planning”.</p>
      <p>The President recalled that he had previously emphasized the need for coordination of
       economic warfare activities (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action No. 1183). It now
       seemed to him that his previous idea—that we needed a Director of Economic Warfare—had been
       too narrow. Perhaps we needed a director of unconventional or non-military warfare. Policy
       decisions in this field should, of course, be taken by the Council, but we also need a
       mechanism for objective study, for digesting information, and for coordinating
       implementation. He did not want half a dozen different agencies reporting to the Council on
       this subject. Perhaps the Planning Board might be supplemented by a special group to study
       this neglected field.</p>
      <p>The President then noted that the Bureau of the Budget is now studying the coordination of
       economic warfare. He requested the Director, Bureau of the Budget, to broaden this study to
       include the placing of responsibility within the Executive Branch for coordinating economic
       warfare, psychological warfare, political warfare, and foreign information.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> said that a large part of the issue in
       this field revolved around the question of who would run psychological warfare in the event
       of war—the military or State. The President said neither one; in time of war these operations
       would have to be conducted under the general direction of the President.</p>

      <p>The President said he hesitated to rescind these policies since the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

      <p>I have reduced to writing some ideas contained in the attached memorandum which I thought I

       operations of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. I am far from certain, however, in my own

       the Department to raise before the <persName corresp="#p_DGJ1">Doolittle</persName> group. I
       should appreciate receiving your guidance on this matter.</p>
      <p>As to the list of questions, I discussed these with <persName corresp="#p_WFG1">Frank
        Wisner</persName>. He thought they were appropriate. He was concerned, however, about the
       possibility of the Assistant Secretaries striking a critical note, due to the fact that in
       some instances operations have been carried out without their knowledge but with a higher
       clearance from you. He hoped that in the morning briefing it would be made clear to the
       survey group that there have been occasions when an operation was cleared only at the top;
       and that these instances could give cause for an Assistant Secretary to believe the operation
       had had no policy clearance whatsoever.</p>

        <item><p>The office of the Deputy Operations Coordinator, directly responsible to the Under
          Secretary, performs the functions called for under paragraph 4 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
           >NSC</gloss> 5412.<note n="3" xml:id="d188fn3"><ref target="#d171">Document
           171</ref>.</note> All covert operations are cleared in advance with the Department
          through this office, which provides the Agency with written policy guidances. The office
          consists of three officers, one responsible for Western and Eastern Europe, one for the
          Far <pb n="521" xml:id="pg_521" facs="0550"/>East and South East Asia and one for the Near
          and Middle East and Latin America. Working closely with this office but not physically
          located in it are a Special Assistant in the Public Affairs office of the Department and a
          Special Assistant for Emigré matters in the Office of Eastern European Affairs. It
          provides a two-way channel of communication between the substantive offices of the
          Department and operational offices of the Agency.</p>
         <p>In order to provide maximum security and control over the coordination of covert
          operations all personal contact between officers in the Department and the Agency on
          specific projects is supposed to be channeled through this office. To a very large degree
          that is now the case. The exceptions are occasions when the Director of <gloss
           target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> approaches the Secretary or Under Secretary directly on
          highly sensitive matters. All records of written communications are filed in this office.
          No copies are permitted to be filed elsewhere in the Department. While policy guidance is
          obtained from the responsible substantive areas, the final guidances in written form are
          prepared in this office only.</p>

         Groups.</p></item>
        <label>II.</label>
        <item>There are two outstanding problems in the field of covert operations which have not
         yet been satisfactorily resolved. <list>
          <label>1.</label>
          <item><p>The Free Europe Committee (<gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>) and Radio Free
            Europe (<gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>) are powerful propaganda and psychological
            political instruments which are controlled by the Agency and are supposed to operate
            under policy guidance from the Department. The <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> was
            created in 1949 as a private organization, financed partly by private donations and
            partly by funds from the Agency, the latter accounting for about two thirds to three
            fourths of the money.</p>
           <p>The purpose of <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> was to provide a means of
            supporting and utilizing prominent political exiles from communist-dominated countries
            without recognizing these groups as Governments in Exile and to avoid complications for
            the Department which maintained diplomatic relations with the Communist Governments of
            the countries from which they fled.</p>
           <p>The two major functions performed by <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> are (1)
            support and utilization of émigré groups as symbols of resistance and (2) broadcasts to
            the peoples of Eastern Europe through <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>. Both <gloss
             target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>, which has its
            base in Munich, Germany, have grown into very large establishments, staffed by highly
            competent people. They produce their own analysis of developments behind the Iron
            Curtain and develop their own programs to influence the people and cause difficulties
            for the Communist regimes.</p>
           <pb n="522" xml:id="pg_522" facs="0551"/>
           <p>While <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> are
            supposed to function within the framework of official US policy and under policy
            guidance from the Department, they have been gradually assuming a degree of independence
            of operation, which has created a control problem. Decisions involving matters of policy
            consequence are frequently taken by <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> and <gloss
             target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> without reference to the Department through the Agency.
            This is a matter of real concern which the Department and the Agency are currently
            attempting to resolve.</p></item>
          <label>2.</label>
          <item><p>The second outstanding problem is that of evolving ways and means of coping more
            satisfactorily with the political repercussions when a covert operation is uncovered. We
            are deeply involved in many countries in the use of covert assets to influence
            developments in a manner favorable to US objectives. While each such case must be
            handled to a large degree on its own merits, there is a need for establishing a few
            basic principles of operation. Due to a still prevalent lack of knowledge and
            understanding of the support role of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> under <gloss
             target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5412 on the part of some officials, both in Washington and
            in the field, there is often a division of opinion as to how such emergencies should be
            handled. This division can freeze initiative and timely action and produce compromise
            positions which are not adequate to meet the problem. The division of opinion, it is
            believed, stems in part at least from an underlying opposition on the part of some
            officials to covert operations of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.</p>
           <p>The solution to this problem must be sought through an educational process with more
            briefings in depth by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> of State Department and
            Foreign Service officers on the task of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and the
            manner in which it attempts to discharge its responsibility. Improvements should also
            result gradually through the efforts of this office to bring about an ever closer
            coordination between the Department and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, so that
            carefully considered policy guidance is provided in advance by the substantive offices
            of the Department for each covert operation in support of overt policies as defined in
            the various <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> documents.</p>
           <p>On the part of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> officials it is necessary that they
            deal with complete frankness with this office and leave to its judgment which officers
            in the Department are to be consulted in order to obtain proper policy guidance for
            specific covert operations. There is still a tendency on the part of some <gloss
             target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> officials to be so secretive that even this office
            sometimes has the feeling that it does not know all that it should in order to discharge
            its responsibility. In order to establish the requisite degree of mutual confidence
            between the Agency and the Department both sides must contribute so that the inhibitions
            and respective reserves developed on both sides during the early formative years of
             <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> gradually fade away.</p>
           <p>It is of the utmost importance that all responsible officials in State and <gloss
             target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> recognize the fact that <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
             >NSC</gloss> 5412 provides for joint <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>-State <pb
             n="523" xml:id="pg_523" facs="0552"/>implementation on <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
             >NSC</gloss> policies; that use of covert operations in support of our overt efforts in
            the field of foreign policy is an established fact; that final decision on the timing
            and nature of such covert operations rests with the Department; that when a covert
            operation goes sour it is a matter of concern to the US Government and not just <gloss
             target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>; and that problems arising out of exposed covert
            operations must be met and minimized by the joint efforts of <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
             >CIA</gloss> and State as a team.</p></item>

      <p rend="center">THE “NET ESTIMATES” PROBLEM</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Introduction</hi>. One of the most basic problems faced by intelligence
       agencies is that of obtaining adequate information of operational matters and of using such
       information to produce meaningful “net estimates” of the capabilities and intentions of other
       nations, taking account of our own acts and facts as they must appear to others. In general,
       U.S. doctrine in the military services has prescribed a sharper separation between
       intelligence and operations than exists in the UK and some, if not most, other nations,
       although in the practical operation of field staffs this separation is usually mitigated or
       overcome <pb n="524" xml:id="pg_524" facs="0553"/>through working understandings. At the
       highest levels in the services, however, and even in the State Department, there is a strong
       tendency either to keep operational matters wholly in “operational” channels, or, if they are
       conveyed to intelligence offices, to impose restrictions against discussion with outside
       agencies. This memorandum deals with efforts made by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
       since the fall of 1950 to meet this problem, in three contexts: (1) National Intelligence
       Estimates handled through regular machinery; (2) specific “net estimates” or “net
       evaluations” handled by special machinery; (3) the Watch Committee, handling intelligence
       from the warning standpoint.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">1. Operational Information and National Intelligence
        Estimates.</hi></p>
      <p>In the <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> field, a distinction must be made between the
       furnishing of operational <hi rend="italic">assumptions</hi> and the furnishing of specific
       operational <hi rend="italic">facts</hi>, especially concerning our own capabilities. The
       former has never presented great difficulties, and is now in satisfactory <gloss
        target="#t_SHAPE1">shape</gloss>. The latter, however, has been troublesome on several
       occasions, and no satisfactory overall solution has been reached.</p>
      <p>In one type of estimate, dealing with the consequences of possible U. S. courses of action,
       operational assumptions as to U.S. policy are the foundation of the estimate. The only
       problem is that of ensuring that the assumptions have appropriate backing, and this is now
       usually done through the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Adviser to the <gloss
        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board, who may consult the Planning Board as a whole
       or may deal directly with the departments most concerned. Assumptions are cleared at whatever
       level is necessary to assure their solidity.</p>
      <p>In the more general type of estimate, dealing with probable developments in a given
       situation, it is occasionally necessary to have—in addition to the always implicit assumption
       of no drastic change in overall US policy—specific assumptions on such matters as US aid
       levels, where the US may affect the situation drastically and immediately. Since the estimate
       may be designed to provide the basis for policy in these very respects, it is sometimes
       necessary to make an arbitrary assumption for the future. For example, the currently pending
       estimate on developments in Taiwan, to be completed for submission to the Planning Board when
       the question of aid levels is discussed, will be based on the assumption that the scope and
       nature of US programs remains as at present. Thus, the estimate will not purport to be
       definitive (even within the usual limits of predictability) but will be a benchmark obviously
       subject to adjustment if a decision is made to alter the scope and nature of the
        programs.…<note n="2" xml:id="d189fn2">Ellipsis in the original.</note> In any event, there
       is no substantial present problem in obtaining such assumptions, which <pb n="525"
        xml:id="pg_525" facs="0554"/>are usually framed in consultation with the <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Advisor to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning
       Board, or occasionally directly by departments principally concerned.</p>
      <p>In contrast with the relative simplicity of the policy-assumptions problem, the problem of
       obtaining specific own-capability facts—or even assumptions—has been complex and difficult.
       Early in the history of the present <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> machinery, in April
       1951, an ad hoc solution was reached for one case, an estimate (<gloss target="#t_NIE1"
        >NIE</gloss> 27)<note n="2" target="d189fn2">For <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 27, see
         <ref target="frus1951v07p2#pg_1623"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1951, vol.
         VII, Part 2, pp. 1623</ref>–<ref target="frus1951v07p2#pg_1624">1624</ref>.</note> on the
       likelihood of invasion of Taiwan. For this estimate, it was obvious that the intelligence
       community needed to know, generally at least, the dispositions of US forces in the area,
       since these forces were the principal obstacle to Chinese Communist action. After some
       negotiation via the service intelligence heads, appropriate “assumptions” approximating the
       real facts were provided and used.</p>
      <p>This specific case was not then made the basis for a general solution, although the need
       was discussed at the working level. No specific proposal was submitted by <gloss
        target="#t_ONE1">O/NE</gloss> to the Director, or by him to other agencies.</p>
      <p>In two major fields, experience has subsequently highlighted the vacuity of estimates
       prepared without clear knowledge of our own capabilities. With respect to Soviet Bloc
       capabilities to attack Western Europe, all estimates through 1950 had been able to proceed on
       the assumption of virtually no Western opposition. From 1951 onward, this assumption became
       increasingly less valid, and in the preparation of the estimates there were prolonged
       discussions leading finally to the use of a fairly meaningless formula that the Soviet Bloc
       could “launch” a lot of campaigns, including a full-scale offensive in Western Europe.
       Whether any meaningful answer could have been provided in Washington without duplicating the
       activities of <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss> is doubtful, but the fact is that no
       machinery existed even for getting and incorporating (with proper credit) the current
       conclusions of <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss>. As they finally stood the estimates
       were certainly not helpful to anyone on this point.</p>
      <p>It was the second field, however, that of air defense of the Soviet Union, which seemed to
        <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> even more forceful, and the experience
       in this field, in the spring and summer of 1952, contributed heavily to the campaign launched
       by him in October 1952, as discussed in the next section. What happened was simple. A pioneer
       national estimate on Soviet air defense capabilities ran into prolonged agency disagreements,
       in which it became more and more clear that any description of the effectiveness of Soviet
       defenses depended entirely on assumptions as to our capabilities and strategy of attack.
       Eventually, it <pb n="526" xml:id="pg_526" facs="0555"/>was recognized that without clear
       guidance on these matters the estimate was, in the words of <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1"
        >General Smith</persName>, merely an inventory of Soviet assets, and it was finally approved
       by the Intelligence Advisory Committee after most qualitative statements had been cut out,
       and after the title had been altered to, “The Scale and Nature of the Soviet Air Defense
       Effort 1952–54.”<note n="3" xml:id="d189fn3">See <ref target="#d120fn2">footnote 2, Document
         120</ref>.</note></p>
      <p>So far as National Intelligence Estimates are concerned, the situation since then has been
       as before—that operational information is not made available to the intelligence community on
       any systematic basis adequate for its employment in such estimates. With the development of
       increasingly close and cordial working relationships both in the <gloss target="#t_IAC1"
        >IAC</gloss> itself and at the National Estimates Board and Staff levels, it is safe to say
       that a great deal of such information is in fact fed informally into the estimates. But much
       operational information is still withheld wholly, and the overall situation is far from
       satisfactory.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">2. Special Machinery for “Net Estimates”</hi></p>
      <p>In the summer of 1951, concern over continental defense, within the National Security
       Council, led to discussion of the need for an authoritative “evaluation” of the net
       capability of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to injure the United States. Although
        <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> made no affirmative effort to have
       sole primary responsibility for the effort—and in fact is believed to have expressed his
       opposition to the assignment—the Joint Chiefs of Staff were diffident, and the upshot was an
        <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> directive, of August 30, 1951,<note n="4"
        xml:id="d189fn4"><gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action No. 543, <ref target="#d86"
         >Document 86</ref>.</note> that <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> prepare a “summary
       evaluation” in collaboration with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and with the internal security
       committees.</p>
      <p>The resulting exercise, handled through regular channels and without any central mechanism,
       was a nightmare. The Intelligence Advisory Committee speedily produced the necessary basic
       estimate of Soviet gross capabilities (<gloss target="#t_SE1">SE</gloss>–14, 18 October
        1951),<note n="5" xml:id="d189fn5">Not printed. (National Archives, RG 263, Soviet <gloss

         target="#t_SE1">SE</gloss>–14 is October 23, 1951.</note> and the internal security
       committees furnished adequate contributions. However, the Joint Chiefs of Staff contribution
       was delayed for several months and when finally produced, in May 1952, proved to be based on
       the most extreme possible estimates of Soviet capabilities and on several other questionable
       assumptions, of a largely intelligence nature, concerning Soviet attack strategy. <persName
        corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> regarded this contribution as unsatisfactory and
       assigned two members of the Board of National Estimates, Mr. <persName>E. M.
        Hoover</persName> and Vice Admiral <persName>B. M. Bieri</persName> (former Deputy <pb
        n="527" xml:id="pg_527" facs="0556"/>Chief of Naval Operations), to the task of producing an
       integrated evaluation merging all contributions, and modifying the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
        >JCS</gloss> contribution. The ensuing procedure was trying to all concerned. It finally
       produced a report which <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> accepted as the
       best obtainable in the circumstances, and which he forwarded to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
        >NSC</gloss> on 14 October 1952.<note n="6" xml:id="d189fn6"><ref target="#d131">Document
         131</ref>.</note></p>
      <p>In his accompanying memorandum <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> noted
       the defects of the report, and gave three “primary reasons” for them. The third of these was:
        <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“c. There is at present no machinery to plan, guide, coordinate and produce an appraisal
         or estimate based on the integration of national intelligence with military, political, and
         economic operational data dealing with our own capabilities.”</p></quote></p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> recommended that as an interim
       measure he be instructed to prepare terms of reference for a more adequate study of the
       problem, and that the Council: <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“c. Concurrently, instruct the Director of Central Intelligence to examine, in
         collaboration with officials of other governmental bodies as needed, the adequacy of
         present machinery, and the character of any new machinery that may be required in order to
         plan, guide, coordinate, and produce for the National Security Council, upon request,
         evaluations in the nature of ‘Commander’s Estimates,’ of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"

         integration of military, political, and economic operational data dealing with United
         States’ capabilities and intentions, and national intelligence.”</p></quote></p>
      <p>When <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>’s recommendations were forwarded
       by the Secretary of Defense to the Joint Chiefs of Staff for comment, the <gloss
        target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> responded by a sharply critical memorandum, dated November 21,
        1952.<note n="7" xml:id="d189fn7">Not found, but See <ref target="#d137fn3">Document 137 and
         footnote 3</ref> thereto.</note> There ensued negotiations, which were limited to the terms
       of reference and procedure for a new study, but which also gave an opportunity for <persName
        corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName> to clarify his ideas to the Joint Chiefs of
       Staff on the overall problem. In the light of the change of administrations then in process
       it was finally decided to let the overall recommendation (subparagraph c. quoted above) lie
       over, while proceeding with a new “net evaluation” on the basis of an entirely novel

       accepted by the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Administration without
       change. It created a Special Evaluation Subcommittee, chaired by a direct Presidential
       appointee, Lt. General <persName>Idwal H. Edwards</persName>, USAF (Ret.)—who was in fact
       nominated by the Joint Chiefs of Staff under a gentlemen’s agreement with General <pb n="528"

       representatives of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss>, and the internal security committees as full members.</p>
      <p>The so-called <persName>Edwards</persName> Committee was given a very short deadline, May
       15, 1953, for the preparation of a new net evaluation to serve as the basis for a policy

        <persName>H. R. Bull</persName>, representing <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, the
       deadline was met. The resulting report (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 140/1, May 18,

        >CIA</gloss>, and, it is believed, to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Secretariat
       and to others familiar with the earlier failure and with the general problem, to prove that
       net evaluations or estimates could be done, even on the most complex problems, through a
       process of constant interchange of intelligence and operational information (under
       appropriate security safeguards), and that the resulting net papers were a vast improvement
       on anything that could be done by intelligence and operations working at arms’ length from
       each other.</p>
      <p>With this pioneer demonstration, attention turned for a time back to the more general
       problem. Largely as a result of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> urging, the report of the
       President’s Committee on International Information Activities (<persName corresp="#p_JCD1"
        >Jackson</persName> Committee), published June 30, 1953,<note n="10" xml:id="d189fn10">See
         <ref target="#d151">Document 151</ref>.</note> included as its very first recommendation
       the following: <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“1. The necessary measures should be taken to provide net estimates of political,
         economic and military capabilities.” (Page 3)</p></quote></p>
      <p>While this recommendation might have provided a lever for reopening the over-all question
       and resurrecting <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">General Smith</persName>’s recommendation c. of
       the preceding October (which was still technically unfinished business in the <gloss

        <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss>. One was the replacement of most of the Joint Chiefs of

       Procedurally, it appears at this writing that the project is being handled at the working
       level with a greater degree of close cooperation even than in the

      <p>During the course of the negotiations on the particular continental defense problem, the
       over-all issue was discussed, and the Director, of Central Intelligence proposed that the
       device of joint responsibility in <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> and the Chairman of the
        <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, the one as intelligence adviser, the other as military
       adviser, to the President and the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>, be extended generally
       to cover problems for which a specific net evaluation, or net estimate, procedure is
       appropriate. (Such problems, generally speaking, would be those of substantial scope,
       involving a complicated study of the interplay of US action and Soviet counteraction. In
       situations where action on both sides would be simple and predictable, the use of joint
       machinery might not be warranted.) For the present, this suggestion is not being pressed,
       since the success of the new continental defense project appears to be important in any
       decision.</p>

       Information</hi></p>
      <p>For that part of the intelligence community that concentrates on providing warning of
       hostile action, knowledge of US or allied operations may be even more vital than for more
       long-range intelligence efforts. Without such knowledge false warnings may be given,
       available intelligence may be seriously misconstrued (in either direction), and intelligence
       effort may not be focused properly at points and areas of tension.</p>
      <p>The 1948–54 history of this problem is covered in detail in reports prepared by the Office
       of Current Intelligence, the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> component particularly
       charged with the watch function and with support of the Watch Committee. The essence of the
       story is that there has been no remotely adequate procedure for keeping the Watch Committee
       informed of operational matters that could have a bearing on its activities. However, as a
       result of the work of an ad hoc Committee designated by the <gloss target="#t_IAC1"
        >IAC</gloss> in 1953 to review the whole Watch Committee process, the Director of Central
       Intelligence, in July 1954, submitted to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>, and the

       a broad and adequate basis for the proper functioning of the Watch Committee in this respect,
       though no doubt particular problems of detail and interpretation will arise. The directive
       provides that in cases where an agency believes that overriding security considerations
       preclude release of information (conceded to be significant to the Watch Committee), the

      <p>During the six-month period beginning July 1, 1954 the departments and agencies plan to
       take the following specific actions having a relationship to courses of action set forth in
        <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 174 and other pertinent <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
        >NSC</gloss> documents. Underlining indicates quotations from paragraphs of <gloss

       department or agency follows in its day-to-day operations the policies set forth, no explicit
       project in regard to those paragraphs can presently be specified.</p>
      <p>The responsibility of the working group is to suggest general courses of action to
       implement the specific objectives set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 174. The
       development of detailed plans to carry out such courses of action is the function of the
       several responsible agencies.</p>

        it is understood that <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2 does not direct the
        abandonment of current operating policies and programs whether overt or covert along these

        “feasible political, economic, propaganda and covert measures are required to create and

        in the absence of detailed <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> guidance on policy toward the
        Soviet Union it is assumed that these courses of action are applicable to the <gloss

      <p rend="center">REPORT ON THE COVERT ACTIVITIES OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY</p>
      <p rend="center">I. Introduction</p>
      <p>The acquisition and proper evaluation of adequate and reliable intelligence on the
       capabilities and intentions of Soviet Russia is today’s most important military and political
       requirement. Several agencies of Government and many thousands of capable and dedicated
       people are engaged in the accomplishment of this task. Because the United States is
       relatively new at the game, and because we are opposed by a police state enemy whose social
       discipline and whose security measures have been built up and maintained at a high level for
       many years, the usable information we are obtaining is still far short of our needs.</p>
      <p>As long as it remains national policy, another important requirement is an aggressive
       covert psychological, political and paramilitary organization more effective, more unique
       and, if necessary, more ruthless than that employed by the enemy. No one should be permitted
       to stand in the way of the prompt, efficient and secure accomplishment of this mission.</p>
      <p>In the carrying out of this policy and in order to reach minimal standards for national
       safety under present world conditions, two things must be done. First, the agencies charged
       by law with the collection, evaluation and distribution of intelligence must be strengthened
       and coordinated to the greatest practicable degree. This is a primary concern of the National
       Security Council and must be accomplished at the national policy level. Those elements of the
       problem that fall within the scope of our directive are dealt with in the report which
       follows. The second consideration is less tangible but equally important. It is now clear
       that we are facing an implacable enemy whose avowed objective is world domination by whatever
       means and at whatever cost. There are no rules in such a game. Hitherto acceptable norms of
       human conduct do not apply. If the United States is to <pb n="543" xml:id="pg_543"
        facs="0572"/>survive, long-standing American concepts of “fair play” must be reconsidered.
       We must develop effective espionage and counterespionage services and must learn to subvert,
       sabotage and destroy our enemies by more clever, more sophisticated and more effective
       methods than those used against us. It may become necessary that the American people be made
       acquainted with, understand and support this fundamentally repugnant philosophy.</p>
      <p>Because of the tight security controls that have been established by the <gloss
        target="#t_USSR1">U.S.S.R.</gloss> and its satellites, the problem of infiltration by human
       agents is extremely difficult. Most borders are made physically secure by elaborate systems
       of fencing, lights, mines, etc., backed up by constant surveillance. Once across borders—by
       parachute, or by any other means—escape from detection is extremely difficult because of
       constant checks on personnel activities and personal documentation. The information we have
       obtained by this method of acquisition has been negligible and the cost in effort, dollars
       and human lives prohibitive.</p>
      <p>The defection of Soviet and satellite personnel offers a more profitable field for
       exploitation. The Agency is properly focusing a great deal of its effort in this direction,
        [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>]. The information obtained from this source
       has been of value but is sporadic and incomplete.</p>
      <p>A still greater potential lies in communications intelligence. This leads to the conviction
       that much more effort should be expended in exploring every possible scientific and technical
       avenue of approach to the intelligence problem. The study group has been extensively briefed
       by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss> personnel and by the Armed Services in the methods
       and equipment that are presently in use and under development in this area. We have also had
       the benefit of advice from certain civilian consultants who are working on such special
       projects. We are impressed by what has been done, but feel that there is an immense potential
       yet to be explored. We believe that every known technique should be intensively applied and
       new ones should be developed to increase our intelligence acquisition by communications and
       electronic surveillance, high altitude visual, photographic and radar reconnaissance with
       manned or unmanned vehicles, upper atmosphere and oceanographic studies, physical and
       chemical research, etc. From such sources may come early warning of impending attack. No
       price is too high to pay for this knowledge.</p>
      <p>In the short time that has been available to us we have been intensively briefed by the
       Director and staff of the Central Intelligence Agency, by the rest of the intelligence
       community, and by the principal users of the intelligence product. We have conferred with
       representatives of other interested Government agencies and with certain knowledgable
       individuals whose past experience and present thinking <pb n="544" xml:id="pg_544"
        facs="0573"/>have made their views of value. The procedures which have been followed, and
       the list of witnesses who have been heard are detailed in Appendix B, attached. Our findings
       and recommendations follow.</p>
      <p rend="center">II. Conclusions and Recommendations</p>
      <p>With respect to the Central Intelligence Agency in general we conclude: (a) that its
       placement in the overall organization of the Government is proper; (b) that the laws under
       which it operates are adequate; (c) that the established provisions for its financial support
       are sufficiently flexible to meet its current operational needs; (d) that in spite of the
       limitations imposed by its relatively short life and rapid expansion it is doing a creditable
       job; (e) that it is gradually improving its capabilities, and (f) that it is exercising care
       to insure the loyalty of its personnel.</p>
      <p>There are, however, important areas in which the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss>
       covert organization, administration and operations can and should be improved. The Agency is
       aware of these deficiencies and in many cases steps are being taken toward their
       solution.</p>
      <p>While we believe our study to have been as comprehensive as possible in the time available
       to us, we realize that it is not complete. We are well aware of the tremendous problems
       facing the Director and staff of an organization such as <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >C.I.A.</gloss> and appreciate the sincere efforts being made to solve them. In an attempt
       to be constructive and in the hope that we may be helpful, we make the following
       recommendations:</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">A. With Respect to Personnel</hi></p>
      <p>That the Agency personnel competence level be raised. The Agency should continually strive
       to achieve this and if necessary reduce its present work load to expedite its realization.
       Necessary steps are: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>Elimination of personnel who can never achieve a sufficiently high degree of
         competence to meet the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss> standard. This will entail a
         substantial reduction in present personnel. There is no place in <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
          >C.I.A.</gloss> for mediocrity.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>Review and improvement of recruitment plans and procedures in order to obtain higher
         quality applicants for Agency jobs. The time required to process them should be
         reduced.</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>Continual improvement of the present excellent training facilities and capabilities in
         all covert activities to keep step with future requirements.</item>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item>An intensified training program to include those key personnel in the covert services
         who require additional training, by rotation through <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss>
         training facilities. At present at least 10 percent of total covert personnel should be in
         training.</item>
        <pb n="545" xml:id="pg_545" facs="0574"/>
        <label>5.</label>
        <item>Assignment to field stations and to country areas of only those people who are fully
         qualified to handle the highly specialized problems involved.</item>
        <label>6.</label>
        <item>Maintaining the position of Director above political considerations in order to assure
         tenure and continuity as in the <gloss target="#t_FBI1">F.B.I.</gloss></item>
       </list></p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">B. With Respect to Security</hi></p>

       name of the United States and the fulfilment of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss>’s
       important mission may not be jeopardized. The following steps should be taken to accomplish
       these objectives: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>Elimination, to the maximum extent practicable, of provisional and preliminary
         clearances in the security processing of prospective Agency personnel.</item>

        <item>Improved and more standardized security processing of alien operational personnel
         prior to their use by the covert services overseas.</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>Immediate completion of full field investigations and polygraph examinations of the
         several hundred Agency personnel who have not yet been fully processed.</item>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item>Establishing of uniform and tighter security procedures at headquarters and suitable

         operations, sources and methods.</item>
        <label>5.</label>
        <item>Insurance of the closest possible coordination of the counterespionage activities of
         the covert services with the over-all counterintelligence activities of the Office of
         Security to prevent, or detect and eliminate, any penetrations of <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
          >C.I.A.</gloss></item>
        <label>6.</label>
        <item>Augmentation of the present sound policy of polygraphing all new employees and all

        <label>11.</label>
        <item>Rigid adherence to the “need-to-know” requirement as the basis for dissemination of

      <p rend="center">III. Discussion</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Introduction—History and Growth of <gloss
         target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss></hi></p>
      <p>The Central Intelligence Agency is an organization of mixed origins and recent growth.</p>
      <p>The overt side of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss>, well described by the Agency’s
       title, took over in 1947 from the former Central Intelligence Group. It receives the
       intelligence collected by all government agencies, processes it, disseminates and files it.
       This phase of the work is well administered under the Deputy Director of Intelligence and
       serves the whole intelligence community. Since 1947 it has grown to its present size of
       approximately [<hi rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>].</p>
      <p>The covert side of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss> started with <gloss
        target="#t_OSO1">O.S.O.</gloss> (Office of Special Operations) which was a remnant of the
       former <gloss target="#t_OSS1">O.S.S.</gloss> Next came <gloss target="#t_OPC1"
        >O.P.C.</gloss> (Office of Policy Coordination) which was the “Cold War Shop,” an offshoot
       of the State Department. The two operated under <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss> in
       virtual independence of each other until they underwent a shot-gun marriage in 1952, and were
       put under a Deputy Director for Plans. This covert side now numbers approximately [<hi
        rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>] on the regular table of organization, and
       approximately as many more engaged in special projects, or about [<hi rend="italic">number
        not declassified</hi>] in all.</p>
      <p>Supporting and serving Intelligence and Plans are about [<hi rend="italic">number not
        declassified</hi>] more persons, of whom about two-thirds are grouped under a Deputy
       Director for Administration, and about one-third are under Directors or Assistant Directors
       reporting directly to the Director of Central Intelligence himself, as in the case of
       Personnel, Training, and Communications. The work of these [<hi rend="italic">number not
        declassified</hi>] is largely in support of covert operations, as the requirements of the
       overt intelligence side are relatively simpler, whether for training or for support.</p>
      <p>Additional personnel on special projects bring the current total to approximately [<hi
        rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>]. In 1947 the total was less than [<hi
        rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>]. This represents a [<hi rend="italic">number not
        declassified</hi>] increase in seven years.</p>
      <p>(<hi rend="italic">Note:</hi> Throughout this report we have considered as “covert” all
       activities that are not “overt.” Specifically, we have included under “covert” the operations
       assigned to the Agency by <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5412 as well as its clandestine
       espionage and counterespionage operations.)</p>
      <pb n="549" xml:id="pg_549" facs="0578"/>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">A. The Personnel Factors</hi></p>
      <p>The most important elements in the successful conduct of covert intelligence operations are
       the people who run them, —from top management down to the agent under deepest cover. First
       consideration, therefore, must be given to the recruitment, selection, training and
       evaluation of the most highly competent people available. They must then be assigned to jobs
       where they can be used most effectively and be given whatever support they require to enable
       them to carry out their missions.</p>
      <p>In the past this Agency has not been entirely successful in achieving this result. In its
       short history it has suffered from lack of continuity in policy direction and management. At
       its inception it suffered from an inheritance of mixed and sometimes mutually antagonistic
       elements from <gloss target="#t_OSS1">O.S.S.</gloss> and other predecessor agencies. Then, at
       a stage when still groping toward a stabilized peacetime program, it was suddenly called upon
       to meet the requirements of the Korean War.</p>
      <p>Under this pressure it “ballooned” out into a vast and sprawling organization manned by a
       large number of people some of whom were of doubtful competence. Of necessity, sensitive
       positions were sometimes filled with people having little or no training for their jobs.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, the Agency did possess an invaluable asset in the form of a hard core of
       capable and devoted men as a part of its World War II inheritance, and did succeed in
       attracting to this cadre an appreciable number of capable people. In some areas they have
       done, and are doing, an excellent job, but it appears from a personnel standpoint, that
        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss> tends to accept more commitments than are warranted
       by its human assets. This leads us to the belief that an immediate re-evaluation of all
       programs should be undertaken by the Project Review Committee to eliminate those of lesser
       importance and to cut back the activity rates of all but the most essential to bring the
       over-all program into a more realistic coincidence with current Agency capabilities. When
       improved recruitment, adequate training and over-all experience level justify, Agency
       activity may again be accelerated.</p>
      <p>We have made a study of the educational and experience background of the 34 key people in
       the Agency’s chain of command. From this the following composite figures emerge: all are
       natural born U.S. citizens; they range in age from 38 to 66 yrs., averaging 47.9 yrs; 32 are
       married; 17 have 1 or more dependent children; 21 are wholly dependent on government salary;
       all but 2 are college graduates; 13 have advanced degrees. Twelve have had 1 or more years
       business experience; all but 6 have served in the U.S. Armed Forces; 15 have had intelligence
       experience (<gloss target="#t_OSS1">O.S.S.</gloss>, Armed Forces, etc.) prior to 1947; and 10
       have had specialized <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss> training. Of this group 32 have
       had 3 years or more service with <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss>, 20 have had 5 years
       or more, and 15 have <pb n="550" xml:id="pg_550" facs="0579"/>been with the Agency for the
       full 7 years since it was established in its present form in 1947.</p>
      <p>The Office of Personnel supplied an excellent statistical study covering [<hi rend="italic"
        >number not declassified</hi>] staff employees and agents on the roster as of 30 June 1954
       from which the following data were taken: males make up 58 percent of total, females, 42
       percent; average age is 34.2 years and two-thirds are in the 25–39 year age bracket. As for
       education, approximately 68 percent of the total are high school graduates, some 47 percent
       have B.A. (or equivalent) degrees, and about 24 percent have done post-graduate work or
       possess advanced degrees. Forty-five percent have served 3 years or more with the <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss> Looking at prior intelligence experience, which includes
       service with the Armed Forces or with the Agency’s predecessor organizations, and realizing
       that all Agency personnel do not require such training, 71 percent had none, but 29 percent
       have had 1 year or more and 11 percent 2 or more years. Of the Agency total, 73 percent have
       had some foreign language training or experience, and nearly half have had some prior foreign
       area knowledge. Slightly over 50 percent are Armed Service veterans.</p>
      <p>From the above we feel that the present personnel potential of the Agency is reasonably
       good. There is convincing evidence, however, that “dead wood” exists at virtually all levels.
       We have heard <gloss target="#t_CRITIC1">critic</gloss>s remark to the effect that there are
       too many ex-military people. We have been advised that some people coming back to
       headquarters from overseas assignments are sometimes not assigned to new jobs for long
       periods. Uncertainties in policy, frequent internal reorganizations, together with
       competition from industry frequently cause good people to seek employment outside. As in
       other governmental agencies, there is a tendency through inertia or because of a desire for
       financial security, for the mediocre to stay. As a result, despite the continual and
       necessary acquisition of additional good people, the competence level of the Agency is not
       rising as rapidly as is desirable. Prompt and drastic action to increase the rate of
       improvement is indicated. We are of the opinion that a planned reduction of at least 10
       percent in present personnel can and should be achieved without reducing the amount and
       quality of Agency output.</p>
      <p>We have been briefed on the Career Service Plan by means of which the Agency hopes to
       increase personnel stability. Whether the plan will achieve this result is as yet unknown,
       but it will not in itself solve the Agency’s personnel problems. Nevertheless we believe that
       a sound Career Service Plan is desirable and should be implemented as promptly as
       possible.</p>
      <p>The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss> has a recruitment program operating in colleges
       and universities throughout the United States. This program has not been <pb n="551"
        xml:id="pg_551" facs="0580"/>entirely successful in producing either the quantity or the
       quality of applicants needed for Agency requirements.</p>
      <p>In part, this is due to the general shortage of technically trained people vis-à-vis heavy
       current demands by industry in practically all fields. On the other hand we have heard
       criticism from scholastic sources that the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss> approach,
       both to the school and to the individual, is not what it should be, and furthermore, that
       many potentially good people are lost because of the very great length of time that now
       elapses between initial contact and entry into the job.</p>
      <p>Clearance of new personnel at present averages 90 days. The <gloss target="#t_FBI1"
        >F.B.I.</gloss> takes only 30 days maximum for clearing its own personnel. Although we
       appreciate fully the special problems involved in <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss>, we
       believe it is both practical and essential to reduce the present 90 day period as much as
       possible.</p>
      <p>Many applicants find the necessary clearance procedures unpalatable and annoying. Some are
       repelled by misunderstanding of the purpose of polygraphic examination and the techniques
       employed. Some (particularly in scientific fields where future professional reputation may
       depend upon publication of papers, etc.) are unwilling to accept the implications of a
       lifetime of anonymity, or of life under a pseudonym. We do not suggest that these
       requirements be abandoned or relaxed in any degree. We are certain that they are necessary
       for maximum security and success of covert operations. But some better means of approach
       should be developed to assure the prospective employee that he is necessary, and to persuade
       him that in this Agency he can find a desirable career and at the same time perform a vital
       service to his country.</p>
      <p>We have been impressed by the excellence of the Agency’s training facilities and the
       competence of its instructor personnel. Our comment is that insufficient use is made of these
       facilities. It is obvious that the language, communication and clandestine agent training
       centers which we inspected are being operated far under capacity levels. This, of course, is
       a reflection of the slacking off in recruiting programs, but it suggests also that adequate
       use of the facilities is not now being made to improve the over-all quality of Agency covert
       activities by new training or refresher training of personnel already in the Agency.</p>
      <p>We are aware that the present tendency of the Agency to take on more work than it can
       handle satisfactorily has limited optimum use of the training facilities, but it cannot be
       repeated too frequently that in <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss> covert operations
       quality is more important than quantity. A small number of competent people in a sensitive
       agency can be more useful than a large number of incompetents. In the long run it will pay to
       stop some of the less essential operations now to permit 10–15 percent of Agency covert
       personnel to go into training. As the backlog of inadequately trained personnel is reduced
       and the competence level of Agency personnel increased, this percentage may be lowered.</p>

      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">B. The Security Factors</hi></p>
      <p>Nothing is more important in the planning and execution of <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >C.I.A.</gloss>’s covert activities than continuing recognition at all levels throughout the
       Agency of the importance of security in all of its aspects. Although many sound and important
       security steps have already been put into effect by the Agency, in view of the outstanding
       importance of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss>’s mission to the national security,
       constant effort must be made to improve security wherever possible.</p>
      <p>We have been thoroughly briefed by the Security Office of the Deputy Director of
       Administration (<gloss target="#t_DDA1">DD/A</gloss>), and by appropriate offices of the
       Deputy Director of Plans (<gloss target="#t_DDP1">DD/P</gloss>) on personnel, physical,
       documentary, operational and cover security. We have examined the Agency’s methods of
       screening out undesirable applicants or present employees by interrogation, field
       investigation and polygraph techniques. We have also examined <gloss target="#t_DDP1"
        >DD/P</gloss>’s methods of processing alien operational personnel prior to their use by the
       covert services overseas.</p>
      <p>We believe that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss>’s security clearance criteria for
       prospective Agency personnel are sound. Without exception, they should be fully adhered to in
       practice. The granting of provisional or other interim clearances should be minimized. Full
       background investigations and polygraph examinations should continue to be prerequisite to
       hiring for all positions. Individuals now on the rolls who have not had the benefit of these
       full security clearance procedures should be so processed at the earliest possible date. (At
       the time of our study there were 132 headquarters and 531 field personnel who had not been
       poly-graphed because they had entered on duty prior to the institution of the polygraph
       program in 1948.)</p>
      <p>We are impressed with the competent manner in which the polygraph program is handled in the
       Agency and with the results obtained therefrom. Polygraph examination has proved extremely
       useful in identifying sexual perverts and other security risks. To September 1, 1954, [<hi
        rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>] polygraph examinations had been conducted,
       resulting in the elimination of [<hi rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>] individuals
       as security risks. We endorse the Agency’s continuation of the polygraph program as an aid to
       investigation and interrogation as long as the present high standards govern the use of this
       device.</p>
      <p>There is considerable room for improvement in existing security processing procedures for
       alien operational personnel. Because some personnel must be used for immediate short term
       operations, it may sometimes be difficult to apply full security clearance procedures to
       them. [<hi rend="italic">11½ lines not declassified.</hi>]</p>
      <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (10 lines) not declassified</hi>]</p>
      <p>A uniform requirement should be established for the submission by all overseas missions of
       regular reports on the status of personnel, <pb n="553" xml:id="pg_553" facs="0582"
       />physical, documentary and related elements of security. Such reports should be submitted to
       the Office of Security with copies to the Inspector General and the appropriate division of
        <gloss target="#t_DDP1">DD/P</gloss>. We recommend that periodic security inspections should
       be made by the Office of Security of all overseas missions and of <gloss target="#t_DDP1"
        >DD/P</gloss>’s headquarters and other facilities in the United States. Tighter security
       procedures at headquarters and particularly in the field will better insure the security of
       the Agency’s facilities, operations, sources and methods. Implementation of these
       recommendations should aid in raising the level of security throughout the entire Agency,
       particularly throughout the covert services.</p>
      <p>If such a system of reporting and inspecting is adopted, the Director can, for the first
       time, look to one office for the security of the entire Agency. He will then have a more
       precise and timely picture of security-related developments throughout the Agency.</p>
      <p>We cannot emphasize too strongly the importance of the continuation and intensification of
        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss>’s counterintelligence efforts to prevent, or detect
       and eliminate penetrations of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss> We endorse fully the
       present counterintelligence practices of the Agency which include polygraphing all personnel
       returning from overseas assignments, automatic security checks and file reviews of personnel
       being considered for transfer in the field or reassignment at headquarters, security checks
       of personnel nominated for special types of clearance, etc. We do not think that periodic
       re-investigation of all personnel is now necessary, but we believe that comprehensive
       rechecks of personnel should be made on a selective basis whenever sound counterintelligence
       practices dictate. Questionable cases should be intensively investigated and expeditiously
       resolved.</p>
      <p>The counterespionage activities of the clandestine services can be one of the most fertile
       sources of information concerning attempted penetrations of <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >C.I.A.</gloss> Appropriate steps should be taken to insure the closest possible
       coordination of <gloss target="#t_DDP1">DD/P</gloss>’s counterespionage activities in this
       field with the over-all counterintelligence activities of the Office of Security. Any
       penetration attempt made against <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss>, whether it involves
       Agency personnel and/or clandestine intelligence operations, can never be fully controlled
       and exploited until all information concerning such attempts—whether made in the United
       States or overseas—is channeled through one focal point, preferably the Security Office.</p>
      <p>“Security consciousness” is an obvious “must” for all <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >C.I.A.</gloss> personnel. Constant efforts should be made to improve the Agency’s security
       indoctrination courses. Regular “security awareness” programs should be inaugurated in order
       that all personnel may be reminded of the continuing need for “security consciousness” in the
       conduct of their day-to-day affairs.</p>
      <pb n="554" xml:id="pg_554" facs="0583"/>
      <p>Most breaches of security committed by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss> personnel
       appear to be inadvertent rather than intentional. The net effect of such breaches on the
       national security is the same regardless of intent. Without exception, an inflexible attitude
       must be adopted with respect to security breaches and severe penalties meted out to employees
       at all levels who advertently or inadvertently violate security.</p>
      <p>Too easy access to much of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss>’s classified data is a
       potential source of trouble. Except for the tight restrictions drawn around supersensitive
       material, large segments of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss>’s files are open to
       inspection and use by Agency personnel without qualification as to “need-to-know.”
       Improvement is needed in carrying out the “need-to-know” rule as a basis for intra-Agency, as
       well as interdepartmental, distribution of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss>’s
       classified data. This situation is aggravated considerably by the fact that there are too
       many duplicate records. The security of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss>’s data is
       further jeopardized by a tendency to over-classify documentary data originating in the
       Agency, a condition which operates in derogation of the security classification system as a
       whole.</p>
      <p>Considering <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss>’s unduly dispersed headquarters (43
       buildings in the Washington area), its physical security program is reasonably good. The
       potential security risks inherent in such wide-spread dispersal make it essential that the
       Agency continue its efforts to consolidate the headquarters facilities into fewer, more
       adequate buildings.</p>
      <p>The physical security measures in effect at <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss>
       installations which were visited in the general vicinity of Washington are excellent. The
       physical security of overseas installations visited by representatives of our study group
       appeared to vary with local circumstances and conditions. The limited number of inspections
       made was not sufficient to allow of definitive conclusions as to the general security of all
       overseas missions. There appear to be, however, no basic, minimum physical security
       requirements governing these missions or stations, except for the safeguarding of classified
       documents. We believe that acceptable minimum standards should be promulgated immediately and
       that regular inspections by qualified Security Office personnel should be made to enforce
       them.</p>
      <p>Detailed plans and preparations should be made for immediate implementation of
       war-emergency measures by all overseas missions and stations, tailored to the local
       conditions. They should provide for maximum safeguarding of Agency personnel and operations,
       and for adequate safeguarding or destruction of classified data and material in the custody
       of the installations in question.</p>
      <p>Secure cover is an inherent part of all clandestine operations. The security of some of the
       Agency’s cover devices is excellent, security of others is inadequate. Cover security is a
       problem that requires continuous and exhaustive study. Detailed standards and procedures,
       policies <pb n="555" xml:id="pg_555" facs="0584"/>and regulations, should be issued for the
       guidance of the personnel concerned. There is need for more adequate briefing of personnel
       departing for overseas assignments concerning the cover of their missions and their personal
       cover problems. The Office of Security should continually monitor the cover devices used in
       all foreign stations.</p>
      <p>Maintaining proper cover in proprietary organizations requires that all personnel concerned
       actually live within the cover framework at all times. Vulnerable points are the channels of
       communications between <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss> and the proprietary
       organizations as well as contacts between personnel of such organizations and other personnel
       of the Agency. Another vulnerable feature is in the assignment of personnel from the Agency
       to the proprietary organizations and the hiring of outside personnel. Any person who has
       previously served in a known capacity with the Agency is a potential security hazard if
       associated with any proprietary organization. A like hazard exists if a person is hired on
       the outside by the organization without first obtaining a complete clearance from the
       Agency.</p>
      <p>Professionally qualified security officers should be placed on the staff of the larger
       proprietary organizations. Experience shows that organizations so staffed usually have fewer
       security compromises. Close coordination should be maintained with the Agency on the matter
       of requesting surveys of proposed “business” sites before they are acquired, so that any
       potential security hazard on or near the premises may be disclosed. All officials of
       proprietary organizations must be indoctrinated in the necessity of conforming with the
       security requirements of the Agency. Neglect of certain basic security requirements by such
       officials can lead to disclosure, breach, or compromise of the covert association.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">C. Coordination and Operations</hi></p>
      <p>The success of the covert operations of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss> depends upon
       how efficiently they are conducted and how well they are coordinated with other agencies of
       the Government. These criteria prevail both in peace and in war, but both coordination and
       operations are necessarily somewhat different during each of these periods. Peace in any
       ordinarily accepted sense of the word, appears to be impossible of achievement in the
       foreseeable future. The covert operations of the Agency must therefore be planned and
       coordinated in order to meet the requirements of a continuing cold war situation as well as
       the requirements of possible hot war. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss> has this
       obligation under <gloss target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss> 5412 (March 15, 1954).</p>
      <p>Looking toward the possible outbreak of actual hostilities in any theater of operations, a
       detailed plan should be developed now delineating the wartime headquarters responsibilities
       of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss> to insure that appropriate policy guidance,
       integrated with <gloss target="#t_NSC1">N.S.C.</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
        >J.C.S.</gloss> plans, be furnished to <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss>
       representatives in the field. In an emergency situation time obviously will not permit
       referral of all critical covert <pb n="556" xml:id="pg_556" facs="0585"/>operational
       questions to Washington. Furthermore, the needs of commanders in the field may require the
       immediate transfer of many local <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss> covert operational
       assets to their commands. It is absolutely essential, therefore, that well-considered,
       well-implemented and pretested plans be prepared in advance to insure smooth transfer of such
       assets and to deal with any other local covert operational problems.</p>
      <p>In the case of espionage and counterespionage operations there is disagreement between
        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss> and some of the military services which has yet to be
       resolved. This relates to the area of “agreed activities” (<gloss target="#t_NSCID1"
        >NSCID</gloss> 5, August 28, 1951)<note n="3" xml:id="d192fn3"><ref target="#d255">Document
         255</ref>.</note> as to which a dispute has dragged on for years. Some of the services feel
       that certain foreign espionage and counterespionage operations must be run directly by them.
       The Director of Central Intelligence has been desirous of securing the voluntary agreement of
       the Armed Services, and has submitted various proposals to them as to the delimitation of
       these areas of “agreed activities.” To date the attempts to resolve the differences have been
       unavailing. We believe that the prime responsibility for the failure does not lie with <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss>, but with these services. In fact, we believe that the
       Director of Central Intelligence, in his desire to reach an amicable solution, has gone
       further than was intended by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">N.S.C.</gloss> directives. Since
       agreement has not been reached on a voluntary basis, the dispute should be resolved by the
        <gloss target="#t_NSC1">N.S.C.</gloss> In the settlement of this dispute, in addition to
       recognizing the right of the Armed Services to perform counterintelligence activities for the
       security of their own installations and personnel, the Armed Services should be allowed to
       engage in espionage and counterespionage operations (provided they are coordinated by the
       Director of Central Intelligence) until such time as <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss>
       has the capability to perform all espionage and counterespionage operations outside the
       United States.</p>
      <p>In order to avoid undue delay in the resolution of such problems in the future, the
       Director of Central Intelligence (as coordinator of all foreign intelligence) should report
       regularly to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">N.S.C.</gloss> on the status of efforts to implement
        <gloss target="#t_NSC1">N.S.C.</gloss> directives, with particular emphasis on major
       unresolved questions.</p>
      <p>Inasmuch as the exploitation of Soviet and satellite defectors outside the United States
       has been a source of annoyance (and even hostility) on the part of some of the military
       services and other agencies toward <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss> and vice versa, we
       believe that steps should be taken immediately to insure full implementation of the defector
       program in accordance with the spirit and letter of <gloss target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss>
       13 (Jan. 19, 1950).<note n="4" xml:id="d192fn4">Referenced in <ref
         target="frus1945-50Intel#d433"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1945–1950,

      <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557" facs="0586"/>
      <p>The misunderstandings which exist between <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss> and the
       Armed Services stem largely from insufficient exchange of information and coordination with
       respect to espionage, counterespionage, and covert operations. We have been advised, for
       example, that in certain instances <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss> operators appear to
       have been too secretive with respect to information which is of direct interest to the
       military services and vice versa. We have been told of incidents where important covert
       operations have been “blown” because <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss> and military
       intelligence units were operating <hi rend="italic">against</hi> each other, without
       knowledge of each other’s interest or activity. The relationship that exists in various
       countries between covert <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss> personnel and the military
       attachés is not always satisfactory. Attachés and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>’s are
       playing important roles in the collection of foreign intelligence and in the defector
       program, and it is, therefore, essential that closer coordination and greater exchange of
       information be established between <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss>’s representatives
       and the military at every foreign station.</p>
      <p>Misunderstandings between some of the services and the Agency are not confined to overseas
       operations. A lack of knowledge of plans, facilities, and operations seems to exist in some
       areas between the Pentagon and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss> Compartmentation can be
       carried too far. Improvement in collaboration at the working levels is particularly
       essential.</p>
      <p>Relations with <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss>’s other principal customer, the
       Department of State, also are not entirely satisfactory. In Washington, coordination seems to
       be reasonably good with well-established liaison channels, but misunderstandings seem to
       exist at many overseas stations. There is a feeling that <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >C.I.A.</gloss> is making too much use of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
        declassified</hi>] cover in many places. Such official cover is thin, at best, and any
       compromise creates embarrassing situations. In some areas <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >C.I.A.</gloss> personnel have not coordinated their activities sufficiently with those who
       should know of them in our embassies. As a result, people have worked at cross purposes, with
       unfortunate results. It is realized that there are situations in which disclosure of plan and
       purpose should be held to a minimum number of people, but in all cases the Senior U.S.
       Representative should be sufficiently advised to insure proper coordination in accordance
       with approved <gloss target="#t_NSC1">N.S.C.</gloss> intelligence directives.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">D. Organization and Administration</hi></p>
      <p>In the course of investigating the covert operations of the Agency, we were briefed on the
       organization of the individual components of the <gloss target="#t_DDP1">DD/P</gloss>
       complex. We also had the benefit of the thinking of a number of key Agency people with
       respect to the <gloss target="#t_DDP1">DD/P</gloss> organization as a whole. As a result
       certain general observations with respect to <gloss target="#t_DDP1">DD/P</gloss>
       organization have emerged which are germane to the problem of the efficiency and economy of
       its operations.</p>
      <pb n="558" xml:id="pg_558" facs="0587"/>
      <p>From the remarks that have been made on the subject of Agency history and personnel
       problems, it is clear that the organization is still in an evolutionary stage. It has
       suffered from a mixed inheritance, a lack of policy continuity, tremendous pressures to
       accept commitments beyond its capacity to perform, and a mushroom expansion. As a result
       there has been an absence of long-range planning with consequent organizational difficulties.
       We are strongly of the opinion that further streamlining of organization, clarification of
       functions, and straightening of lines of authority will result in more and better work with
       fewer people at lower costs.</p>
      <p>The covert activities of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss> fall under the direction of
       the Deputy Director for Plans (<gloss target="#t_DDP1">DD/P</gloss>). They are presently
       conducted by a complicated organization of a mixed straight-line and functional type in which
       staff has been superimposed on staff to such an extent that duplication of effort,
       conflicting command authority, and division of responsibility have inevitably resulted in
       dilution of the total effort.</p>
      <p>There are six principal staffs in the <gloss target="#t_DDP1">DD/P</gloss> complex ranging
       in size from [<hi rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>] people, totaling [<hi
        rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>]. These are superimposed over seven area
       divisions ranging in size from [<hi rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>]. Five of the
       staffs have subordinate divisions, and two of the staffs have subordinate staffs. In
       addition, each of the divisions has its own set of staffs. Altogether, the <gloss
        target="#t_DDP1">DD/P</gloss> complex totals over 40 major units.</p>
      <p>We are strongly of the opinion, based upon our limited review of the <gloss
        target="#t_DDP1">DD/P</gloss> element, that consideration of a complete reorganization of
       the element is needed. As an indication of the type organization that might be more effective
       and less costly, we have included in this report for consideration purposes only, a revised
       organization chart as Appendix D. A chart of the present <gloss target="#t_DDP1">DD/P</gloss>
       organization is also included, for purposes of comparison, as Appendix C. The personnel
       contemplated under the revised <gloss target="#t_DDP1">DD/P</gloss> organization would number
       approximately 1,000 less than are presently employed by this element.</p>
      <p>In considering any reorganization, we cannot emphasize too strongly our feelings with
       respect to the need for greater security in all <gloss target="#t_DDP1">DD/P</gloss>
       operations. As the covert side of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">C.I.A.</gloss>, it should operate
       with a maximum of anonymity. Knowledge of its physical location, operation and the identity
       of its personnel should be kept on an absolutely need-to-know basis.</p>
      <p>We feel that continuous inspection and closer control (both fiscal and operational) over
       covert activities are necessary. We realize that certain security risks are involved but we
       believe they can be handled properly.</p>
      <p>The subject of fiscal control, and the relationship of the Comptroller to the organization
       are discussed under Section E following.</p>
      <p>The concept of an Inspector General for the Agency is sound. He should report only to the
       Director. He should be given the greatest possible <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0588"
       />latitude and authority to inspect all aspects of the Agency at any time, including the
       Director’s own office and the <gloss target="#t_DDP1">DD/P</gloss> complex. We believe that
       any limitations that have been placed on this function in the past should be completely
       removed.</p>
      <p>Because of the rapid expansion of the Agency, its operations are conducted in some 43
       buildings in the Washington area. Some of these buildings are of temporary wartime
       construction and constitute a fire hazard. This forced decentralization of operations results
       in great loss of time of personnel whose duties require them frequently to visit various
       buildings of the Agency; it increases security problems; and it results in a great reduction
       in over-all efficiency. We recommend that sympathetic consideration be given to the Agency’s
       effort to obtain funds with which to provide centralized accommodations for its activities,
       and we suggest that these accommodations would best serve the peculiar requirements of the
       Agency if they were hand-tailored to its needs. We are of the opinion that in a relatively
       short time the expenditure required would be self-liquidating.</p>
      <p>Although in the present organizational plan of the Government <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >C.I.A.</gloss> seems to be well integrated into the Intelligence Community at the National
       Security Council level, events have occurred recently (for example—Guatemala) which indicate
       that gaps exist in high level planning and coordination of important covert operations which
       may expose the U.S. Government to unnecessary risks of compromise. Overall policy guidance
       comes from <gloss target="#t_NSC1">N.S.C.</gloss>, and is satisfactory, but better
       coordination is needed for the more important covert activities of <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >C.I.A.</gloss> at the national level. This is the function of the Operations Coordination
       Board, but at the present time it does not appear to be giving the Agency adequate guidance
       and advice on the more important covert projects. The activities of the Board should be
       broadened in order to provide the <gloss target="#t_DCI1">D.C.I.</gloss> with the support he
       needs on such projects.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">E. The Cost Factors</hi></p>
      <p>The budgetary procedures of the Agency were reviewed with the Agency Comptroller and
       representatives of the Bureau of the Budget and appear to be satisfactory. Between the fiscal
       years ended June 30, 1947 and 1955 the total budget has increased from approximately [<hi
        rend="italic">dollar figures not declassified</hi>], the latter figure including a reserve
       fund of [<hi rend="italic">dollar figure not declassified</hi>]. The 1955 fiscal year budget
       exclusive of the reserve fund is divided approximately as follows: <table rows="5" cols="2">

       </table></p>
      <pb n="560" xml:id="pg_560" facs="0589"/>
      <p>Since indirect or support costs are relatively proportionate to direct costs, the total
       budget may be considered to be approximately [<hi rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>]
       for covert and [<hi rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>] for overt operations.</p>
      <p>The number of civilian employees of the Agency under personnel ceilings has increased from
        [<hi rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>] at June 30, 1947, to an estimated [<hi

       military personnel has increased during the same period from [<hi rend="italic">number not

        [<hi rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>] for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1955
       will be allocated as follows: <table rows="7" cols="2">

      <p>This total does not include individuals under contract, who are not regular employees of
       the Agency, individuals under deep cover and those engaged in proprietary enterprises, and
       indigenous personnel. The aggregate of persons in these categories is estimated at [<hi
        rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>], most of whom are engaged in covert
       operations.</p>
      <p>The actual number of individuals to be engaged on Agency activities for the fiscal year
       1955 will, therefore, be approximately [<hi rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>].</p>
      <p>The covert operations of the Agency are budgeted and accounted for on a project basis
       except for headquarters and overseas support costs. Political and psychological and
       paramilitary projects exceeding a specified minimum dollar total are in general reviewed and
       approved by a Project Review Committee. Foreign Intelligence projects are not subject to
       review by this committee but are authorized by the Director of the Agency, the Deputy
       Director of the Agency, the Deputy Director of Plans, or certain other individuals depending
       upon the estimated dollar costs of individual projects. We believe that for purposes of
       control and as an aid in auditing, Foreign Intelligence projects (except those of an
       extremely sensitive nature) should be made subject to review and approval by the Project
       Review Committee.</p>
      <p>Due to <gloss target="#t_DDP1">DD/P</gloss>’s present secrecy policies with respect to
       Foreign Intelligence projects, the Comptroller of the Agency is unable to maintain meaningful
       records showing the expenditures made for individual projects in this category. The Foreign
       Intelligence Staff keeps certain <pb n="561" xml:id="pg_561" facs="0590"/>records of such
       expenditures but on the basis of a calendar rather than a fiscal year. We believe that the
       Comptroller should be furnished with information which will enable him to record, control and
       account for the costs of the individual projects of this element of the Agency. Adequate
       protection for security purposes can and should be provided within the Office of the
       Comptroller.</p>
      <p>Certain other projects in the political and psychological and paramilitary areas, of a
       sensitive nature are occasionally developed and processed without full information with
       respect thereto being given to the Deputy Director for Administration and the Comptroller.
       Since, of necessity, the funds must be made available by the Comptroller, it is inevitable
       that he will have knowledge that operations of this nature are being conducted and it is
       unlikely that more specific information relating to the projects can long be kept secret from
       him. In one particular instance where substantial sums were expended, the Comptroller was
       called upon to make the expenditures with no supporting data being furnished to him at the
       time or at any future date. When we requested breakdowns of costs of the operation we found
       that they were available only in the area division involved and that they were incomplete and
       unsatisfactory. We are of the opinion that this deviation from the normal procedure of
       placing upon the Comptroller the responsibility of accounting for expenditures is unsound,
       and is not justified by the claim that the security of the operation is improved by this
       deviation.</p>
      <p>We are of the opinion that the administrative plans for individual covert projects are not
       in all instances as complete in detail as is desirable and that if they were amplified the
       Comptroller and the Auditor-in-Chief would be in a much better position to carry out their
       respective duties and responsibilities.</p>

      <p>The President saw <persName corresp="#p_DGJ1">General Doolittle</persName> and other
       members of the Committee appointed to investigate the activities of the <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.</p>
      <pb n="562" xml:id="pg_562" facs="0591"/>
      <p>The report was presented by <persName corresp="#p_DGJ1">General Doolittle</persName>,<note
        n="2" xml:id="d193fn2">For the written report, see <ref target="#d192">Document
        192</ref>.</note> who said they had gone over it with <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
        Dulles</persName> for three reasons: (1) to be absolutely fair; (2) to study Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> better to watch for his reactions to a report not wholly
       favorable; (3) and their hope that the maximum good would come out of the report. Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> made several recommendations that were
       incorporated in the report.</p>
      <p>The President prefaced his remarks by saying that of course Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
        >Dulles</persName> knew, as does everyone, that no two men would have the same judgments
       about certain things. That what we wanted to know was did we have a good man for the <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> head, and was he being selective and skillful in getting his
       assistants, and was his team working together in the best interests of the United States.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_DGJ1">General Doolittle</persName> emphasized that the report was
       constructive criticism and in no sense a white wash. Some of the recommendations were very
       technical.</p>
      <p>About <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>: his principal strength is his unique
       knowledge of his subject; he has his whole heart in it, his life, he is a man of great
       honesty, integrity, loyally supported by his staff. His weakness, or the weakness of the
        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is in the organization—it grew like topsy, sloppy
       organization. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> surrounds himself with people
       in whom he has loyalty but not competence. There is a lack of discipline in the organization.
       There is a complete lack of security consciousness throughout organization. Too much
       information is leaked at cocktail party.</p>
      <p>There is the family relationship with the Secretary of State. Such relationship can be
       important as it leads to protection of one by the other or influence of one by the other.
        <persName corresp="#p_DGJ1">Doolittle</persName> feels that it is a relationship that it
       would be better not to have exist. The President thought, however, there was something more
       favorable to be said about the relationship; he appointed <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
        Dulles</persName> in full knowledge of the relationship and thinks it might be
       beneficial.</p>
      <p>About <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>’ two chief assistants. <persName
        corresp="#p_WFG1">Frank Wisner</persName> is a chap of great promise but not a good
       organizer.</p>
      <p>About <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>’ readiness to accept criticism,
        <persName corresp="#p_DGJ1">Doolittle</persName> said he is highly emotional; wherever
       criticism was against him he took it well; he fought for his staff people, however, to the
       point of becoming emotional.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_DGJ1">Doolittle</persName> had said that <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1"
        >Bedell Smith</persName> had at one time said that <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
        >Dulles</persName> was too emotional to be in this critical spot. He said further he thought
       his emotionalism was far worse than it appeared on the surface. The President said he had
       never seen him show the slightest disturbance. He said further that we must remember that
       here is one of <pb n="563" xml:id="pg_563" facs="0592"/>the most peculiar types of operation
       any government can have, and that it probably takes a strange kind of genius to run it. The
       President said that what did disturb him was what the Committee reported about his
        assistants—<persName corresp="#p_WFG1">Wisner</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CGCP1"
        >Cabell</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_DGJ1">Doolittle</persName> said in his opinion
        <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> did not have an administrative
       individual in either. <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> said he was convinced
       no military man could do the job. President pointed out importance of <persName
        corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>’ contacts throughout world. President further
       said, with reference to lack of security, that it was completely frustrating to find always
       evidence that people are talking. Security Council has gotten pretty good.</p>
      <p>President said his next move would be to get <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>
       in and talk to him about it. The relationship with Secretary of State did not disturb him
       because part of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>’s work is extension of work of State
       Department. He further feels the confidential relationship between the two brothers is a good
       thing.</p>
      <p>Someone in room said <persName corresp="#p_BRMJ1">Bissell</persName> was not a good man.
       Also that <persName corresp="#p_ARJ1">Amory</persName> was an exceptionally fine man.</p>
      <p>President said we were interested in two things: (1) improvement within <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> itself; (2) improvement in relationship and better
       understanding between <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and rest of intelligence committees
       in government.</p>
      <p>President said he was astonished at the difficulty of getting good administrators in
       government; that he had found a good many fine administrators throughout his long career.</p>

        <item>A Unique Opportunity for Comprehensive Intelligence</item>
       </list>
       <p>For many years it has been clear that aerial photographs of Russia would provide direct
        knowledge of her growth, of new centers of activity in obscure regions, and of military
        targets that would be important if ever we were forced into war. During a period in which
        Russia has free access to the geography of all our bases and major nuclear facilities, as
        well as to our entire military and civilian economy, we have <pb n="565" xml:id="pg_565"
         facs="0594"/>been blocked from the corresponding knowledge about Russia. We have been
        forced to imagine what her program is, and it could well be argued that peace is always in
        danger when one great power is essentially ignorant of the major economic, military, and
        political activities within the interior zone of another great power. This ignorance leads
        to somewhat frantic preparations for both offensive and defensive action, and may lead to a
        state of unbearable national tension. Unfortunately, it is the U.S., the more mature, more
        civilized, and more responsible country that must bear the burden of not knowing what is
        happening in Russia. We cannot fulfill our responsibility for maintaining the peace if we
        are left in ignorance of Russian activity.</p>
       <p>While aerial photography could be the most powerful single tool for acquiring information,
        it has until now been dangerous to fly over Russia. Up till now, the planes might rather
        readily be detected, less readily attacked, and possibly even destroyed. Thus no statesman
        could have run the risk of provocation toward war that an intensive program of overflights
        might produce. The Air Force has, for a long time, studied a program of overflight as a
        natural aspect of its Reconnaissance mission and has, in recent months, considered several
        proposals for airplanes designed for this purpose. While it is important that such research
        and development continue in the Air Force, for the present it seems rather dangerous for one
        of our military arms to engage directly in extensive overflight.</p>
       <p>On the other hand, because it is vital that certain knowledge about industrial growth,
        strategic targets, and guided missile sites be obtained at once, we recommend that <gloss
         target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, as a civilian organization, undertake (with the Air Force
        assistance) a covert program of selected flights. Fortunately, a jet powered glider has been
        carefully studied by Lockheed Aircraft Corporation for overflight purposes. This
        manufacturer proposes to take full responsibility for the design, mock-up, building, secret
        testing and field maintenance of this extraordinary and unorthodox vehicle, making it
        feasible for a <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> task force to undertake this vital
        activity. Such a task force requires highly specialized and able guidance in procurement and
        operation (by Air Force officers for aircraft, by scientists for photographic and electronic
        equipment). The Lockheed super glider will fly at 70,000 feet, well out of reach of present
        Russian interception and high enough to have a good chance of avoiding detection. The plane
        itself is so light (15,000 lbs.), so obviously unarmed and devoid of military usefulness,
        that it would minimize affront to the Russians even if through some remote mischance it were
        detected and identified.</p>
       <p>Since the proposed mission of this plane is first of all photographic, and only
        secondarily electronic, a word should be said about the information expected from the

        cloud cover over Russia. Photographs are appended<note n="4" xml:id="d194fn4">Not
         found.</note> that demonstrate the large information content of pictures taken from these
        great altitudes. A single mission in clear weather can photograph in revealing detail a
        strip of Russia 200 miles wide by 2,500 miles long. Cloud cover will reduce completeness, of
        course, but clouds are not a serious obstacle because one can afford to wait for good
        weather; alternate routes over clear areas can be selected in flight; and finally, the
        number of intelligence targets accessible during a single mission is so large that even a
        partial sampling would yield an extraordinary amount of intelligence.</p>
       <p>The opportunity for safe overflight may last only a few years, because the Russians will
        develop radars and interceptors or guided missile defenses for the 70,000 foot region. We
        therefore recommend immediate action through special channels in <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
         >CIA</gloss> in procuring the Lockheed glider and in establishing the <gloss
         target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> task force. No proposal or program that we have seen in
        intelligence planning can so quickly bring so much vital information at so little risk and
        at so little cost. We believe that these planes can go where we need to have them go
        efficiently and safely, and that no amount of fragmentary and indirect intelligence can be
        pieced together to be equivalent to such positive information as can thus be provided.</p>

      <p>Director of Central Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>
       prepared a paper for a review of national security policy then underway on November 18, 1954.
        <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> reviewed the evolving dynamics of the
       superpower competition, predicting that, over the next few years, the Soviet Union would
       become a more formidable competitor with the West in all regions of the world. To respond to
       this growing competition (which <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> believed would
       remain primarily diplomatic, economic, and cultural, and was not likely to result in a ground
       war), <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> noted that the United States needed “to
       employ in a closely coordinated fashion all the cold war weapons at its disposal.” To do so,
       the government required “the decisive coordination of political, military, economic and
       covert actions.” The text is in <ref target="frus1952-54v02p1#pg_776"><hi rend="italic"

      <p>In our opinion there are serious gaps in our Intelligence covering the Soviet Bloc areas,
       particularly in relation to our ability to determine the capabilities of the Soviet Union to
       launch nuclear attacks against the U.S. and to detect indications of their intentions to do
       so. We believe that we could have a substantially improved capability of filling these gaps
       through the use of aerial reconnaissance and photography, and that today these methods are
       the most practicable additional means to this end.</p>

      <p>You are familiar with the large gaps in our Intelligence coverage of the Soviet Union which
       prevent us from obtaining adequate knowledge of Soviet intentions and, in important respects,
       of Soviet capabilities; and in particular, with respect to their capabilities and intentions
       to launch nuclear attacks on the United States. You are familiar, too, with the current and
       growing difficulties in the way of filling those gaps by the more classic means.</p>
      <p>In my considered judgment, as well as that of the other members of the Intelligence
       Community, there is not the prospect of gaining this vital Intelligence without the conduct
       of systematic and repeated air reconnaissance over the Soviet Union itself. (Even this does
       not assure adequacy, but will certainly provide a much closer approach to adequacy.) The
       members of the <persName corresp="#p_DGJ1">Doolittle</persName> Committee in their
        report,<note n="2" xml:id="d198fn2">
        <ref target="#d192">Document 192</ref>.</note> expressed their belief that every known
       technique should be used and new ones developed to increase our Intelligence by high altitude
       photographic reconnaissance and other means, and that no price would be too high to pay for
       the knowledge to be derived therefrom. Thus, there is a definite and urgent National
       requirement for photographic and electronic reconnaissance overflights of the Soviet
       Bloc.</p>
      <p>While we have been considering the problem for a long time (you may recall a discussion I
       had with you some months ago concerning overflights), Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">James
        R. Killian, Jr.</persName>, and members of Project 3, Technological Capabilities Panel,
       Office of Defense Mobilization, (<persName corresp="#p_LEH1">E.H. Land</persName>,
        <persName>James G. Baker</persName>, <persName>Joseph W. Kennedy</persName>,
        <persName>Edward M. Purcell</persName> and <persName>John W. Tukey</persName>) have
       independently arrived at essentially the same conclusion.<note n="3" xml:id="d198fn3"><ref
         target="#d194">Document 194</ref>.</note> I have also discussed it with Secretary <persName
        corresp="#p_THE1">Talbott</persName> and with <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General
        Twining</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d198fn4"><ref target="#d196">Document
        196</ref>.</note> We are all agreed that the requirement is an urgent one and <pb n="572"
        xml:id="pg_572" facs="0601"/>that with suitable direction and support, it is feasible of
       accomplishment with minimum risk.</p>
      <p>An existing Air Force aircraft type (the Canberra)<note n="5" xml:id="d198fn5">The aircraft
        became known as the RB–69.</note> is considered capable of modification to give it a ceiling
       of around 65,000 feet. At such an altitude now, the expectation that it would be detected is
       very low indeed, and the possibility that it would be intercepted and shot down is
       practically nil. The possibility of forced landing in enemy territory exists, but the chances
       of that are low. The repercussions of its falling into enemy hands can be mitigated if the
       aircraft should be manned by non-official U.S. personnel. To the extent practicable, we would
       try to man the aircraft with Poles or other non-U.S. nationals. The aircraft itself, if not
       completely destroyed, would bear no markings that would clearly identify its origin. (The
       Canberra itself is nearly identical with its British prototype.)</p>
      <p>As a follow-on to the Canberra, we would simultaneously proceed with the procurement of
       specially designed reconnaissance aircraft with more advanced performance characteristics,
       that would take it to around 70,000 feet.<note n="6" xml:id="d198fn6">This aircraft would
        become the U–2.</note></p>
      <p>In addition to this high altitude day reconnaissance, we would resort to very low altitude
       reconnaissance at night with appropriate aircraft. Whereas the night reconnaissance would not
       provide a substitute for the high altitude day photography, nevertheless it would give an
       opportunity for supplementary reconnaissance, exploiting such technical developments as
       infrared photography and certain electronics techniques.</p>
      <p>Of course, not even the 70,000 foot opportunity will be of indefinite duration. Our problem
       will be one of keeping ahead and creating new opportunities as the old disappear.</p>
      <p>We are all agreed also that, in order to attain a status of readiness to launch these
       flights as early as desired, and then to conduct them, extraordinary procedures would have to
       be adopted for aircraft, crew and equipment procurement, testing, training, and for
       operations. This would require the greatest possible collaboration between the Air Force and
       the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
      <p>I recommend that you: <list>
        <label>a.</label>
        <item>Approve the existence of a National requirement for the above reconnaissance
         overflights.</item>

      <p rend="center">INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION COLLECTION PROGRAM AND THE COORDINATION OF
       REQUIREMENTS</p>
      <list>
       <label>1.</label>
       <item>Coordination of collection requirements which are responsive to the intelligence
        production programs of the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> and its member agencies is
        fundamental to obtain the maximum benefit from the collection activities of the Government.
        A number of these production programs have been fairly defined. They include: the <gloss
         target="#t_NIS1">NIS</gloss> (now in its eighth year), National Intelligence Estimates with
        its annual program and postmortem procedures, research in economic, scientific and technical
        intelligence, and the Watch Committee and the National Indications Center. The recently
        approved Priority National Intelligence Objectives (<gloss target="#t_DCID1"
         >DCID</gloss>–4/4)<note n="2" xml:id="d202fn2"><ref target="#d201">Document
         201</ref>.</note> are intended to provide more discriminating guidance than heretofore to
        these production programs, from which, in the main, requirements for collection stem
        directly rather than from the <gloss target="#t_DCID1">DCID</gloss>–4/4.</item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>Because of the size and number of the research elements in the intelligence community
        and their remoteness from collection activities, the function of collection requirements is
        the vital link which warrants constant and careful attention in order to assure that
        collection activities are supporting, without duplication or other needless collection, the
        priority production programs.</item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>It is believed that a first step in providing such attention is to bring together in
        one place the essential, factual material on what collection mechanisms exist and how
        requirements are today levied and coordinated. The attached paper purports to be an initial,
        though admittedly incomplete, statement of such.</item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item>This paper has been prepared through the cooperation of officers within <gloss
         target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> who are close to and have some responsibility for matters
        described herein. As it may be amended and improved, it might serve several purposes: <list>
         <label>(a)</label>
         <item>The Director and the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> might use it in budget
          presentations to inform the Bureau of the Budget of this segment of intelligence
          activities</item>
         <pb n="579" xml:id="pg_579" facs="0608"/>
         <label>(b)</label>
         <item>It might serve as a bench mark established at this time and place which would later
          serve as a point of reference and measurement of our program in the future</item>
         <label>(c)</label>
         <item>It might acquaint any reader with some of the problems and activities involved in the
          coordination of collection requirements and in ways not previously possible, thus serving
          as an educational paper</item>
         <label>(d)</label>
         <item>Insofar as it is complete and authorative, it should serve as a base for those who
          have the responsibility for seeking to effect improvements in directing the collection of
          intelligence information toward the most useful purposes.</item>
        </list></item>
       <label>5.</label>
       <item>Facts about big bureaucracy with its many people and many procedures are difficult to
        come by. Accordingly suggestions from the readers of this document as to how it can be made
        more accurate and useful would be appreciated.</item>
       <label>6.</label>
       <item>It has been recommended to the Director by the Board of National Estimates in
        connection with its proposed review of <gloss target="#t_DCID1">DCID</gloss>–4/2 (National
        Intelligence Objectives)<note n="3" xml:id="d202fn3"><ref target="#d25">Document
         25</ref>.</note> that the Director initiate a review of the coordination of collection
        requirements. Such a review would necessarily require among other things an understanding of
        the way in which the collection mechanisms themselves are administered, their capabilities
        and their relations with producers as well as requirements officers. While a general review,
        such as proposed, is appealing it should also be kept in mind that there are continual
        efforts directed toward improvement in specific areas. For example, as a means of effecting
        improvement in the handling of defector exploitation for intelligence purposes the <gloss
         target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> at its meeting of 20 December 1954 instituted certain new
        arrangements. Of course, a general review and special attention to specific collection
        problems could go forward hand in hand.</item>

          the Foreign Service for collection are in the last analysis the responsibility of the
          Assistant Secretaries of the respective bureaus in the Department of State. Except for
          agricultural reporting which is now administered by law directly<note n="6"
           xml:id="d202fn6">There are current negotiations between the Departments of State and
           Agriculture which have resulted in a temporary agreement for the continuance of
           agricultural reporting on the Soviet Bloc by State. These talks are continuing with
           regard to State’s assistance to Agriculture for agricultural reporting on the Free World
           (many areas not covered by AAs [Agricultural Attachés] can be covered in part by State).
           [Footnote in the original.]</note> by the Department of Agriculture, the Department of
          State must provide reporting of interest to the U.S. Government with its many
          non-intelligence interests as well as to the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss>
          Community. It must also be recalled that this same Foreign Service has other major
          responsibilities, namely, representation to foreign governments and protection of U.S.
          interests abroad. The desk officers in each political bureau depend to a considerable
          extent upon the intelligence organization of the Department of State for the preparation
          and coordination of requirements for intelligence reporting.</p>
         <p>Increased attention to the collection of information abroad for the use of intelligence
          is reflected in the new chapter (900) of the Foreign Service Manual which deals with this
          subject. In the economic field the “<gloss target="#t_R1">R</gloss>” Area in the
          Department of State cooperates with the Division of Foreign Service Reporting to insure
          that insofar as possible available resources of the Foreign Service are not requested to
          collect information available in Washington and that requirements relevant to national
          security are given precedence over those for less vital functions of the Government (such
          as development of information about possible markets for U.S. products abroad). State
           “<gloss target="#t_R1">R</gloss>” has invited the assistance of ORR and the Economic
          Intelligence Committee (EIC) to assist in the preparation of guides for economic
          reporting. The intelligence organization <pb n="581" xml:id="pg_581" facs="0610"/>in State
          has also invited <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_OCI1">OCI</gloss>
          to participate in the preparation of instructions for political reporting.</p>
         <p>It should also be borne in mind that the “<gloss target="#t_R1">R</gloss>” Area itself
          is an important originator of requirements for reporting in the political, cultural and
          social field and that while it has access to other collection mechanisms, the Foreign
          Service is a prime collector of information in the area of intelligence assigned to State.
          The establishment of a national intelligence estimating program and the demand on the
           “<gloss target="#t_R1">R</gloss>” Area of State for contributions thereto represent an
          important influence in guiding the “<gloss target="#t_R1">R</gloss>” Area to requisition
          information on gaps of fundamental importance. There are comparable effects upon reporting
          by virtue of the “<gloss target="#t_R1">R</gloss>” Area’s participation in the Watch
          process, as well as in the <gloss target="#t_NIS1">NIS</gloss> production.</p></item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item><p><hi rend="italic">Peripheral Reporting Program:</hi> This program was established
          as a separate collection device within the Foreign Service under the Chiefs of Mission.
          Its purpose is to obtain information on the Soviet Bloc countries by the assignment of
          competent officers to certain posts contiguous to the Soviet Bloc where the potential data
          on that area is substantial. This was necessary as a means of supplementing the reporting
          from missions behind the Iron Curtain area where many local restrictions are imposed on
          our staffs. At present, peripheral reporting units are located in Frankfurt, Vienna,
          Paris, Tel Aviv and Istanbul. In Frankfurt the peripheral reporting unit prepares
          comprehensive studies in the political, cultural, sociological and economical fields based
          on information collected on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>; these reports are
          called SPONGE reports.</p>
         <p>The peripheral reporting officers make use of a variety of sources including defectors,
          escapees, refugees, travelers and officials of other governments located in the same areas
          as the peripheral units. The original emphasis was upon collection from arrivals from
          behind the Iron Curtain. Peripheral officers are now encouraged to develop other sources
          among the indigenous travelers to and from the Soviet Bloc and staffs of other government
          located in the same countries as the peripheral reporting unit. While the peripheral units
          are encouraged to develop sources as indicated above, the main sources at present are as
          follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
           <p>Frankfurt (defectors)</p>

          Director, Office of Libraries and Intelligence Acquisition, Department of State (also
          designated informally, “Special Assistant for Maps”). Under the direction of the Special
          Assistant for Maps, foreign maps are procured through the Department of State and Foreign
          Service. Although the function of overt collection of maps abroad rests with the
          Department of State, the geographic research function has been transferred from State to
           <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>; hence, the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
          direction of a State collection program. Four map procurement officers are stationed in
          the field and part-time map procurement activity is assigned to other foreign service
          officers stationed in other areas. Salaries and administrative support of these field
          officers are the responsibility of State and during recent budget reductions two map
          procurement officers were dropped despite the efforts of <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
           >CIA</gloss> to persuade the Department of State to retain them.</p>
         <p>The above program for the collection of foreign maps has been in existence seven years.
          Procurement has been routinized by the establishment of informal exchange agreements (140)
          with certain countries under which new map production is received in Washington through
          the Foreign Service posts.</p>
         <p>Requirements of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and Department of Defense components

         <p>Frequently, an approaching assignment for production of an <gloss target="#t_NIS1"
           >NIS</gloss> Chapter IX (Map and Chart Approval) on a given area has provided a stimulus
          for procurement of foreign maps on that area in time for use in Washington in producing
          the Chapter. In other cases foreign map requirements are in direct response to individual
          agency research projects or to recognized gaps in foreign map coverage.</p>
         <p>The coordinated interagency map procurement program does not conflict with the map
          exchange agreements between the mapping components of Defense and the opposite agencies in
          foreign countries. Some of these agreements pertain to joint mapping programs with other
           <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries. Agreements between the Army Map Service
          and the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries’ mapping agencies provide the bulk

          maintains at the present time six full-time Publications Procurement Officers (in Moscow,

          officers, by providing them with evaluation on their efforts, and by working closely with
          those personnel in the defense departments engaged in preparing collection requirements

         <p>Current monitoring of the press of our two major enemies, <gloss target="#t_USSR1"

          Dissemination is made by State within the Government and to a few private institutions.
          The Hong Kong Press Monitoring Service has access to (a) [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not

          daily covering the main articles of the Hong Kong press), Summary of the Chinese Mainland
          Press (produced on the average of three or four issues per week covering the main topics
          of the Chinese language press and dividing the topics in catagories of subject interest),
          and Current Background (a study of various topics of political, economic and sociological
          significance based on press articles extending over an indefinite period of time). Wide
          dissemination of these press summaries is given within the U.S. Government and to 25

         <p>In addition to the press summaries prepared by embassy employees (whether Foreign
          Service or <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>, etc.) the missions frequently obtain
          press summaries from other governments. In approximately 15 posts, press summaries of the
          British are obtained while to a much lesser extent, press summaries prepared by the French
          are received. In nine posts, press summaries prepared by the host government are received
          and in one post (Tehran) a press summary prepared by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"

          Intelligence photography is collected from the air, on the ground, or as records from
          radarscope presentations. The U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy operating squadrons and
          attachés collect approximately 75% and 15% respectively with the rest attributable to U.S.
          Army, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, and other miscellaneous sources. Most of the
          aerial photography collected by the Army for the Army Map Service is purchased from
          commercial organizations. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> concentrates its effort
          toward the collection of aerial photos from certain firms and foreign governments.</p>
         <p>Aerial and ground photographs are required by the intelligence analysts and mapping
          agencies throughout the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> to corroborate other
          intelligence data and fill existing gaps in intelligence. They are essential to the
          production and maintenance of accurate large-scale topographic maps and the preparation of
          strategic and tactical target programs (Air Force) now in progress. <gloss
           target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> intelligence analysts require photographic intelligence in
          support of intelligence objectives, which <pb n="591" xml:id="pg_591" facs="0620"/>may be
          geographic, economic, scientific, or military in nature and to support clandestine
          operations.</p>
         <p>While procedures exist in each agency for the coordination of its photographic
          requirements, there has been established, on the invitation of AFOIN in 1948, an
          Interagency Graphics Research Coordinating Group. Orginally, the group was composed of the
          three services; it was joined by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> in 1951. This Group,
          meeting monthly, exchanges information regarding photo requirements, location of desired
          photography, overseas commercial mapping activities and related matters. Highly classified
          and highest priority aerial photographic requirements are reviewed and coordinated by
           <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> Plans and Policy with final concurrence of State,

       <item>Acting on the suggestion of the Board Assistants, the <gloss target="#t_OCB1"
         >OCB</gloss>, at its meeting of August 25, 1954,<note n="2" xml:id="d203fn2">See <ref
          target="#d190fn1">Document 190 and footnote 1</ref> thereto.</note> requested the Working

         190</ref>.</note> particularly a major coordinated effort by appropriate agencies designed
        to detach one of the important European satellites from the Soviet bloc. The Working Group
        was requested to submit a preliminary staff analysis to the Board which would point up the
        policy and strategic implications and feasibility factors that would be involved in such an
        effort. <pb n="592" xml:id="pg_592" facs="0621"/>At their meeting of August 13, 1954,<note
         n="4" xml:id="d203fn4">No record of this meeting has been found.</note> the Board
        Assistants agreed that Albania should not be considered as an “important” satellite for the
        purposes of this study.</item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>The Working Group first reviewed existing intelligence estimates of the political
        situation concerning all of the Eastern European satellites. Then a study was made of the
        methods that might be used to detach a satellite. U.S. capabilities for such action were
        reviewed and conclusions flowing from the analysis were drawn. Studies on the
        vulnerabilities of East Germany and Czechoslovakia were prepared especially for this
        review.</item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>The analysis indicates that the instrumentalities of Soviet dominion in the political,
        economic and cultural fields, backed by military force, continue to be effective in
        maintaining control over the satellites. The progressive sovietization of the political,
        social and economic structure of the satellites, the orientation of the local economies
        towards the East and the concentrated effort at indoctrination of the rising generation have
        served further to support Moscow’s control over the satellite areas. The Soviet orbit
        nevertheless has vulnerabilities which are susceptible to exploitation by the United
        States.</item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item>Without attempting to be categorical, it is the opinion of the Working Group that soft
        treatment cannot be expected to effect the basic changes in the nature of communist regimes
        which would conform to U.S. objectives; and that therefore, except when relaxations are
        calculated to obtain carefully defined limited objectives within a short time span or to
        protect the people against the regime under special circumstances of internal tension,
        pressures should be increased against any part of the Soviet orbit where suitable
        opportunities appear. The importance of this subject justifies study of appropriate
        implementing actions consistent with U.S. policy as it develops.</item>
      </list>
      <p rend="center">Recommendation</p>
      <p>It is recommended that the Board concur in the following: <list>
        <label>a.</label>
        <item>At present, given the strength of the Soviet position, no major Soviet satellite
         presents vulnerabilities of such extent that their exploitation can be expected to result
         in its detachment from the Soviet bloc.</item>
        <label>b.</label>
        <item>U.S. capabilities under present conditions are not sufficient to accomplish the
         detachment of any major Soviet satellite by means short of war.</item>
        <label>c.</label>
        <item>Unless the power balance between the United States and the Soviet Union changes
         drastically in our favor, there is little likelihood <pb n="593" xml:id="pg_593"
          facs="0622"/>of detaching a major satellite at any time without grave risk of war except
         by negotiation. The only satellite which now lends itself to possible detachment by this
         means is East Germany. If an effort against this satellite were to be undertaken with any
         hope of success it would require a concentration of political, economic and psychological
         measures directed to this end. A study of the requirements of such a concentrated effort
         should now be undertaken with East Germany as a target in order that advantage may be taken
         of any future development making possible the unification of Germany by negotiation on
         terms acceptable to the U.S.</item>

      <p>As Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> and his assistants briefed us our

      <p>I was impressed, but not at all surprised, at the very constructive approach which
        <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> and all of his associates have taken to
       the <persName corresp="#p_DGJ1">Doolittle</persName> Report. I am convinced that assiduous
       efforts are being made by the Agency to profit by such of the recommendations contained
       therein as may be meritorious. The fact that <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
        Dulles</persName> would take the time to consult members of an extinct committee is as
       unusual as it is desirable, and it speaks well of <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
        Dulles</persName>’ continuing efforts to improve the performance of the many important
       national security responsibilities which devolve upon <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.
       (The use of the participants in the <persName corresp="#p_DGJ1">Doolittle</persName> survey
       in a continuing, consultative capacity strikes me as being highly desirable in view of the
       background which they have accumulated concerning the covert operations of <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> has in
       mind consulting with these same people on future occasions.)</p>
      <p>I suggest that you give the President a brief oral fill-in on the foregoing when the
       opportunity presents itself. I suggest also that a word of appreciation from the President to
        <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> would be well deserved.</p>

      <p rend="center">Memorandum of Agreement Between the Attorney General of the United States and
       the Central Intelligence Agency for the Entry of Aliens of Interest to the Central
       Intelligence Agency Under Special Circumstances</p>
      <p>The Central Intelligence Agency has frequent need for the covert temporary entry of aliens
       into the United States for intelligence and operational purposes within its jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>To effectuate entry in such cases, the Central Intelligence Agency will submit each such
       alien’s case in writing to the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization with the
       request to defer inspection of the subject upon arrival and parole to the Central
       Intelligence Agency under the authority of Section 212(d)(5) of this Immigration and
       Nationality Act.</p>
      <p>In order that the intelligence benefits to be derived from such entries not be outweighed
       by the dangers, if any, to the internal security of the United States by the presence of such
       aliens, the Central Intelligence Agency agrees that it will take all necessary steps to
       establish the bona fides of each prospective entrant prior to submittal to the Immigration
       and Naturalization Service. It further agrees: (a) That this method of entry will only be
       utilized where it is strictly in the national interest; (b) That each request will be
       accompanied by a summary of pertinent background and biographical data with particular
       emphasis on aspects bearing on internal security and admissibility under the immigration
       laws, as well as the result of a current check of the <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss>
       files; and (c) That the place, time and manner of arrival will be coordinated with the
       Service in advance thereof.</p>
      <p>Each alien whose entry is authorized by the Commissioner under the foregoing procedure will
       be paroled for such period of time as may be agreed on by the Central Intelligence Agency and
       the Service, in no instance to exceed one year. Further extensions of parole, similarly <pb
        n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0627"/>limited, may be authorized thereafter on a written
       statement of need, which will include the results of a current security check.</p>
      <p>Upon arrival each alien will execute an agreement acknowledging parole status in a form
       satisfactory to the Central Intelligence Agency and the Service.</p>
      <p>After parole of such aliens, the Central Intelligence Agency will assume responsibility for
       care, supervision and control of a kind and degree it believes consistent with the internal
       security needs of the United States during continuance of their parole status. Further, in
       the case of any alien whose physical custody is not to be maintained or is to be terminated,
       the Central Intelligence Agency will keep the Service informed as to his activities and
       whereabouts for the duration of his parole status. In addition, the Central Intelligence
       Agency will arrange for presentation of each alien for registration pursuant to law at a time
       and place satisfactory to the Service.</p>
      <p>Upon completion of their intelligence or operational purposes in the United States, or if
       internal security reasons so require, these aliens will be removed therefrom through the
       arrangements and at the expense of the Central Intelligence Agency, except in these cases in
       which other disposition is made of a nature satisfactory to the Service. Also, the Central
       Intelligence Agency will inform the Service sufficiently in advance of each proposed
       departure as to permit verification thereof if the Service so elects.</p>
      <p>In accordance with past practice, the Service will apprise the <gloss target="#t_FBI1"
        >FBI</gloss> of the entry and departure or other disposition of these aliens.</p>
      <p>The Service will maintain separate and secure files under this agreement.</p>

       <item>Pursuant to the recommendations of the National Security Council in <gloss

         action reads: “Adopted the recommendation of the Net Capabilities Evaluation Subcommittee
         that there be established a permanent procedure to insure a continuous evaluation of the
         general nature of the one made by this Subcommittee, and a continual watch for significant
         changes; such procedure to provide for a report to the National Security Council at least
         once a year and, in any event, at whatever time changes become apparent that would
         significantly alter the net capabilities of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to
         inflict direct injury upon the continental U.S. and key U.S. installations overseas.”
         President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> subsequently approved this

         (National Archives, RG 59, S/S–<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> (Miscellaneous) Files:
         Lot 66 D 95, Records of Action by the National Security Council, Box 102)</note> I hereby
        establish a permanent procedure to provide integrated evaluations of the net capabilities of
        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, in the event of general war, to inflict direct
        injury upon the continental U.S. and key U.S. installations overseas, and to provide a

        of attacks which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is capable of delivering during

        taking into account the effect of U.S. counterattacks during this period. A separate
        evaluation will be made, assuming each of the following types of initial attack: <list>

         <item>An initial surprise attack, based on a <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> decision

          with tactical warning intervals appropriate to target location and type of attack.</item>
         <label>b.</label>
         <item>An initial attack, based on a <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> decision to
          balance all factors involved in initiating general war; preceded by the amount of
          strategic warning estimated to be most likely under those circumstances.</item>
         <label>c.</label>
         <item>An initial attack preceded by sufficient strategic warning to place U.S. military and

          action.</item>
        </list></item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item>Integrated evaluations should be submitted to the Council on or before October 1 of
        each year, and relate to the situation on a critical date normally about three years in the
        future. In addition to these annual integrated evaluations, an integrated evaluation should
        be submitted to the Council at such times as the Subcommittee feels that a change has become

         >USSR</gloss> to inflict direct injury upon the continental U.S. and key U.S. installations

       <label>5.</label>
       <item>In order to prepare these integrated evaluations I hereby establish a Net Evaluation

        warning to be expected in the event of various types of attack which might be initiated by
        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. It concludes that the U.S. could expect possibly
        as much as six months and not less than 30 days warning of Soviet preparations for a
        full-scale ground, sea, and air attack in the event of prior mobilization. It also
        concludes, however, that particularly by 1957 only a few hours or in some cases no specific
        warning, other than that provided by early warning radar, could be relied upon in event of
        various types and scales of surprise attack. A periodic review and revision of this estimate
        is contemplated.</item>

      <p>Our advance warning largely depends on sifting a large quantity of material to discover
       those indications of enemy activity which suggest that measures are being taken to implement
       a decision to attack. The enemy’s choice of the type of attack greatly affects our advance
       warning capability. We are largely dependent on radar and forward observation stations for
       early warning of air attack, in the event that our intelligence fails to discover indications
       of preparations therefor and if the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should risk
       launching such an attack without prior <pb n="605" xml:id="pg_605" facs="0634"/>mobilization.
       We lack adequate penetrations of the Soviet Bloc that can be relied on to provide warning in
       the event that the enemy is willing to risk a surprise attack without extensive mobilization.
       Reports of troop movements and logistical activity are usually reported too late or are too
       inconclusive to give adequate early warning in such an event. We are exploiting all available
       sources of information and constantly striving to develop new and improved means of detection
       of attack.</p>
      <p>As stated in <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 11–8–54, “The warning process is …
       affected by the whole context of events in which it operates, including psychological factors
       and even pure chance. It cannot be regarded as a mechanical process which it is possible for
       intelligence to set up once and for all and which thereafter operates automatically.”</p>

        <p>Limited gains were made during the past six months in the following fields: analysis of

        Services for development of the optimum opportunities for air action, are approximately 50%

         Intelligence notes that the rate of production of air target materials for the highest
         priority, (all-weather) Navy targets continues to be a matter of concern. The Target Area
         Analysis Radar (TAAR) is considered to be the most significant piece of target material
         developed and produced for-all weather, medium to high altitude operations. Between July
         1952 and July 1954 the Navy nominated 632 all-weather targets for inclusion in the Air
         Objectives Folder Program for production of TAAR’s. As of December 1, 1954, TAAR production
         had not been started for 52%. TAAR production was in process for 22%, and TAAR had been
         completed for 26%. The TAAR is seldom useful for low-level, all-weather mining but charts
         can serve adequately where there are steep gradients along the shore. In other cases the
         capability for conducting these operations is greatly reduced. No intelligence solution
         appears possible. Low-level, high-speed aircraft missions require special charts for
         navigation and approach which are not now available. However, such charts are under
         development. [Footnote in the original.]</note></item>

        <p>Recent defections of fairly high level Soviet officials have served to confirm important

        essentially the product of collation and analysis of data from primarily overt sources.
        Economic intelligence on the Soviet Bloc has improved as a result of additional systematic
        analysis of the Soviet potential industries. Experimentation is under way on new economic
        research techniques for the evaluation of Soviet capabilities for supporting <pb n="609"
         xml:id="pg_609" facs="0638"/>specialized weapons programs. Among the major unsolved

        reasonably well established. Further information and research are required to determine
        agricultural and handicraft output, chemical and munitions output, transportation

        includes an assessment of possible long-run economic developments within the Soviet Bloc as
        they relate to economic defense policies. Intelligence support for enforcement of economic
        defense measures has been maintained in spite of diminishing information on trade
        transactions. Intelligence on shipping engaged in Soviet Bloc trade continues to be good,
        and there has been some improvement in cargo information. Continued joint conferences with
        the UK have produced substantial agreement on intelligence concerning Free World trade with
        Communist China, although significant differences still exist as to the type and quantity of
        cargoes reaching Communist China from or via Hong Kong and other trans-shipment points.

          gain; in the case of the Satellites, there has been a decline, at least in political
          reporting. Some improvement in reporting has been hoped for because of the greater
          cordiality of Soviet Bloc officials in their contacts with Western representatives, but
          little is yet evident. On the other hand, a decrease in the flow of overtly collected

        guidance has been initiated to relate attaché activities more directly to urgent

       <item>As stated above, the working up of plans and programs to implement national security

        need in Government to infuse in such plans and programs dynamic, new and imaginative ideas,
        to diagnose precisely how best to meet the over-all problems of a given country or area, to
        bring into balance all aspects of a problem and all resources available to solve it, to find
        ways effectively to utilize U.S. private organizations and foreign individuals and groups
        and foreign public and private organizations. The promotion of such imaginative planning,
        based on the best intelligence obtainable, should materially aid in coordinating economic,
        psychological, political warfare, and foreign information activities so as to further
        international cooperation and understanding, to reduce the Communist threat, to strengthen
        friendly ties with the U.S., to promote the freedom, well being, and dignity of the

       <item>In view of the past history in this field and the nature of the issues identified in

       <p rend="center">SUMMARY OF PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE ARRANGEMENTS WITHIN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT
        SINCE WORLD WAR II (with particular respect to the problems posed by <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
         >NSC</gloss> 59/1 and 127/1)</p>
       <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">World War II</hi></p>
       <p>1. Approximately six months after U.S. entry into World War II, the <gloss
         target="#t_OWI1">OWI</gloss> (Office of War Information) was established by Executive Order
        in June 1942.<note n="14" xml:id="d213fn14">President <persName>Franklin D.
          Roosevelt</persName> signed Executive Order No. 9182 on June 13, 1942. (Department of
         State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, June 27, 1942, p. 566)</note> The <gloss
         target="#t_OWI1">OWI</gloss> was responsible for domestic and overt foreign information
        programs and answered directly to the President. Policy guidance was provided by the
        Committee on War Information, chaired by the Director of <gloss target="#t_OWI1"
        >OWI</gloss>, with representation which included the departments of State, War, and
        Navy.</p>
       <p>2. Subsequently, in 1943, the <gloss target="#t_OSS1">OSS</gloss> (Office of Strategic
        Services) was established and made responsible, among other functions, for the conduct of
        covert information and propaganda activities abroad, answering to the Joint Chiefs of
        Staff.</p>
       <p>3. There was no psychological warfare organization for the services as a whole, although
        there was created within SHAEF a special psychological warfare staff division on a level
        with <gloss target="#t_G21">G–2</gloss>. In theaters of military operations, each commander
        set up his own psychological warfare organization and coordinated psychological warfare with
        his combat operations.</p>
       <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Post-World War II</hi></p>
       <p>4. Following the end of the war, the <gloss target="#t_OSS1">OSS</gloss> was dissolved and
        certain overt activities of the <gloss target="#t_OWI1">OWI</gloss>, including the <gloss
         target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> facilities, were transferred to the Department of State. At
        the same time the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> took over the intelligence and covert
        psychological warfare activities of the <gloss target="#t_OSS1">OSS</gloss>. The military
        services retained their psychological warfare units on a greatly reduced scale, though they
        conducted significant activities in this area through the reorientation program necessitated
        by the occupation of Germany and Japan. This was the status of organization within the
        Government in early 1947 when the exigencies of the current cold war posed increased
        challenges and demands on U.S. activities in this field.</p>
       <pb n="630" xml:id="pg_630" facs="0659"/>
       <p>5. At the end of 1947, by interdepartmental agreement, the State Department was charged
        with the responsibility for current peacetime propaganda activities (<gloss target="#t_NSC1"
         >NSC</gloss> 4 Dec. 9, 1947).<note n="15" xml:id="d213fn15">See <ref

          Emergence of the Intelligence Establishment, Documents 252</ref>–<ref
          target="frus1945-50Intel#pg_265">265</ref>.</note> To provide for closer policy
        coordination and integration of facilities and programs, an Interdepartmental Coordinating
        Staff (<gloss target="#t_ICS1">ICS</gloss>) was established under the direction of the
        Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs. Representatives of State, Army, Navy, Air
        Force and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> participated on this joint staff. The
        organization was to develop psychological objectives for cold war programs and to coordinate
        the activities of the operating agencies.</p>
       <p>6. This agreement accordingly placed responsibility upon the Secretary of State for
        peacetime psychological operations during the cold war; the question of wartime conduct of
        psychological warfare was not covered by this early agreement but was left for further
        study. Early in 1949, interdepartmental agreement was reached on the establishment in the
        State Department of a planning organization to develop plans for interim arrangements for
        foreign and domestic information programs and overt psychological operations abroad during
        the initial stages of war (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 43, March 9, 1949).<note
         n="16" xml:id="d213fn16"><gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 43, “Planning for Wartime
         Conduct of Overt Psychological Warfare,” is in National Archives, RG 59, S/S–<gloss

         Series.</note> The director of this planning staff was appointed by the Secretary of State
        in consultation with directly interested agencies. The staff was composed of State and
        military personnel, with liaison representatives from <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
        and <gloss target="#t_NSRB1">NSRB</gloss>. Policy consultants to the director of the staff
        were designated by the Secretary of State and Defense, the Director of <gloss
         target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and the Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_NSRB1">NSRB</gloss>.
        The functions and personnel of this staff overlapped to a considerable degree with the
        Interdepartmental Coordinating Staff (<gloss target="#t_ICS1">ICS</gloss>). This condition
        and subsequent experience led to a review of existing arrangements (see <gloss
         target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 43/1, Aug. 2, 1949).<note n="17" xml:id="d213fn17"><ref

       <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 59/1</hi></p>
       <p>7. As a result, in March 1950 revised basic principles for handling psychological warfare
        planning and operations were adopted and put into effect. (<gloss target="#t_NSC1"
         >NSC</gloss> 59/1, March 9, 1950). The principle that propaganda in both peace and war is a
        continuing mechanism of national policy directed toward the achievement of national aims was
        reaffirmed. Under <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 59/1, the Secretary of State was
        charged with responsibility for: <pb n="631" xml:id="pg_631" facs="0660"/>
        <list>
         <label>a.</label>
         <item>The formulation of policy and plans for the National Foreign Information program
          during peacetime.</item>
         <label>b.</label>
         <item>The formulation of national psychological warfare policy in time of national
          emergency or threat of war and during the initial stages of war.</item>
         <label>c.</label>
         <item>The coordination of policy and plans for these activities with other appropriate
          agencies. The policy and planning for periods of emergency and the initial stages of war
          were to be coordinated with the joint war plans of the Department of Defense, and where
          such plans had a direct impact on war plans, they were to be subject to <gloss
           target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> concurrence.</item>
        </list></p>
       <p>8. In accordance with <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 59/1, a revised central planning
        and coordinating mechanism based on the consolidation of the former Staffs was established
        to deal with these responsibilities. The <gloss target="#t_ICS1">ICS</gloss> became the
        Interdepartmental Foreign Information Staff (<gloss target="#t_IFIS1">IFIS</gloss>). The
        director was appointed by the Secretary of State and was in fact the Assistant Secretary of
        State for Public Affairs. The group of consultants was retained. This combined mechanism
        became the Interdepartmental Foreign Information Organization (<gloss target="#t_IFIO1"
         >IFIO</gloss>).<note n="18" xml:id="d213fn18">The <gloss target="#t_IFIO1">IFIO</gloss>
         became the body charged with psychological warfare policy in time of national emergency or
         during the initial stages of war. Following the Presidential directive of April 4, 1951,
         establishing the <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_IFIO1"
          >IFIO</gloss> was redesignated the <gloss target="#t_POCC1">POCC</gloss>, Psychological
         Operations Coordinating Committee. The <gloss target="#t_POCC1">POCC</gloss> created a
         subcommittee, the X-Day working group, to prepare the required plans. [Footnote in the
         original. For the April 4 directive, see <ref target="#d60">Document 60</ref>.]</note></p>
       <p>9. Again there was avoided coming fully to grips with the issue of jurisdictional
        responsibility for psychological warfare policy and direction during war, because of the
        fundamental differences between State and the military services on the question. Agreement
        had been reached only for planning through the initial stages of war, but even this concept
        was left without precise definition. This arrangement proved unsatisfactory and the cause of
        friction from many aspects.</p>
       <p>10. The <gloss target="#t_IFIS1">IFIS</gloss> joint staff was charged with planning for
        emergency and wartime psychological operations and completed a study shortly after the
        outbreak of war in Korea on the assignment of psychological warfare responsibilities for the
        initial stages of war (defined as D plus 90) and for the subsequent stages of war. This
        study was transmitted to the departments for adoption in July 1950.<note n="19"
         xml:id="d213fn19">The study cited presumably is <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 74 of

        established within the State Department to act as the “executive agent” of the Secretary of
        State in formulating policy plans for, and coordination of, the world-wide conduct of
        psychological warfare.</p>
       <p>12. The transition from the peacetime organization to the initial stages of war
        organization was to take place on D-Day, or earlier at the discretion of the President. The
         <gloss target="#t_IFIO1">IFIO</gloss> would be designated the Interim Psychological Warfare
        Board and strengthened; as executive agent for the Secretary of State, it would issue
        directives.</p>
       <p>13. These recommendations led to further controversy. In the fall of 1950 Secretary of
        Defense <persName corresp="#p_JL1">Johnson</persName> advocated the immediate establishment
        of the Interim Psychological Warfare Board in the Executive Office of the President and
        immediate consideration of the question of composition and urgency of a National
        Psychological Warfare Board. He proposed that the latter Board would be independent of
        existing departments and have full-time public members in the majority. On the other hand,
        the Department of State was not willing to accept establishment of the Interim Board as an
        executive agent for the Secretary of State at that time. The issue was posed as to whether
        or not such an interim board would impair the Secretary of State’s responsibility for the
        conduct of foreign affairs. Accordingly, an impasse developed.</p>
       <p>14. Meanwhile, in August 1950, in the light of the Korean developments, State strengthened
        the <gloss target="#t_IFIO1">IFIO</gloss> organization. The interdepartmental consultants
        group was expanded and renamed the National Psychological Strategy Board. It was headed by
        the Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs and was composed of representatives of
        the Secretary of Defense, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, the Director of <gloss
         target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and the Army as Executive Agent of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
         >JCS</gloss> for the conduct of psychological warfare in Korea.</p>
       <pb n="633" xml:id="pg_633" facs="0662"/>
       <p>15. Attempting to break the organizational deadlock, State proposed in December 1950 a new
        concept, emphasizing continuing psychological effort, (rather than phased operations) for
        both peace and war. The conclusion was that the same organization should be responsible for
        formulation of policy and programs in both peace and war. It was proposed to place
        responsibility for all phases in the Secretary of State with an interdepartmental
        coordinating agent to advise the Secretary on policy and to coordinate planning operations.
        This proposal was rejected by Defense.</p>
       <p>16. A new memorandum of agreement and disagreement was then worked out
        interdepartmentally. It set forth the issue somewhat as follows. Agreement was reached on
        the following points: <list>
         <label>a.</label>
         <item>The peace-to-war phasing was eliminated and the need for organizational and policy
          continuity recognized. The responsibility of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> in
          theaters of military operations and of State in other areas was reaffirmed.</item>
         <label>b.</label>
         <item>A single official, designated by the President: <list>
           <label>(1)</label>
           <item>Should be responsible for formulation of psychological policy within the framework

         <item>Representatives at the policy levels, also agencies executing major portions of the
          psychological effort, should advise this official and coordinate operations.</item>
        </list></p>
       <p>17. There was disagreement as to whether or not the single official designated by the
        President should be the Secretary of State or an independent official responsible to the
        President. Arguments were put forth for both propositions, and the matter was referred to
        the President for decision in January 1951.</p>

       <p>18. The problem was worked on by the <gloss target="#t_BOB1">BOB</gloss>, the <gloss
         target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Staff, and a final agreement was negotiated by the agencies
        concerned. This resulted in the directive of the President on June 20, 1951, establishing
        the Psychological Strategy Board.<note n="20" xml:id="d213fn20">See <ref target="#d60"
          >Document 60</ref>.</note> The principle of psychological operations was recognized.
        However the designation of a single official as the focus of responsibility was replaced by
        the concept of a Board composed of the Undersecretary of State, the Undersecretary of
        Defense, and the Director of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. A director appointed by
        the President served under the Board, and was placed in a position to take initiative <pb
         n="634" xml:id="pg_634" facs="0663"/>in, and give direction to, government-wide
        psychological operations. The Board was directed particularly to: <list>
         <label>a.</label>
         <item>provide more effective plans of psychological operations within the framework of
          approved national policies;</item>

         <item>evaluate the effectiveness of the national psychological effort.</item>
        </list></p>
       <p>19. In the meantime the <gloss target="#t_IFIO1">IFIO</gloss> have been continuing to
        struggle with the formulation of a “national psychological warfare plan” for general war, to
        include principles of operation, delineation of responsibilites and organizational
        principles, etc. Since the <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> now had been given authority
        for such planning, the <gloss target="#t_IFIO1">IFIO</gloss> plan along with alternate
        departmental versions was, accordingly, referred for further study and action to the <gloss

        changed subsequent to a recommendation by the Bureau of the Budget. In approving <gloss

       <p>23. The <persName corresp="#p_SGWB1">Jackson</persName> Committee noted that the <gloss
         target="#t_POCC1">POCC</gloss>, which had existed as a mechanism through which the State
        Department could coordinate the Foreign Information Program, was responsive to a necessary
        function, but recommended that the <gloss target="#t_POCC1">POCC</gloss> be abolished and
        its function made a responsibility of the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> and the <gloss
         target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> staff.</p>
       <p>24. As a result, in a special memorandum to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> by the
        President, dated September 3, 1953 the functions of the <gloss target="#t_POCC1"
         >POCC</gloss> were transferred to the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>. The <gloss
         target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> did not immediately abolish the <gloss target="#t_POCC1"
         >POCC</gloss>, but after the lapse of a little time discontinued it as a separate

       <p>25. In the fall of 1953 the ad hoc Committee on X-Day planning reported to the <gloss

        revisions to the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> for transmittal to the <gloss

        127/1, which in effect reopened many of the old arguments between the agencies concerning
        jurisdiction and the conduct of psychological operations during wartime. The matter was
        further complicated by trying to propose revisions to cover all types of hostilities, in
        order that “support planning should anticipate as far as possible every such situation from

        psychological warfare, political warfare, and foreign information activities”. However, the
        Bureau of the Budget was not specifically directed to propose a solution to the
        organizational and jurisdictional problems concerning psychological warfare operations
        during hostilities which are raised by <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 127/1 and which
        have such a long history, and its projected report does not propose a solution to this
        matter.</p>
       <p>30. In a letter to the Director, Office of Defense Mobilization dated February 7,
         1955,<note n="24" xml:id="d213fn24">Not found.</note> the Executive Officer of the
        Operations Coordinating Board noted that the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> is
        currently responsible for the coordination of the transfer of overt information facilities,
        personnel, etc., to the theater commander in a period of general war “and that adequate
        authority and procedures exist utilizing the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> structure
        to carry out this responsibility in a limited conflict.” However, he further commented that
        in the absence of detailed plans for full mobilization in time of war, it did not appear to
        be feasible for the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> to develop such plans for
        psychological warfare to be applicable in the event of general war.</p>
       <p>31. In a memorandum dated January 11, 1955, subsequently circulated to the <gloss
         target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> on February 8, 1955, with a supporting memorandum from the
        Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff reaffirmed their views of August 3, 1954,
        and specifically proposed that any document designed to supersede <gloss target="#t_NSC1"

      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJP1">Coyne</persName> introduced his presentation with a brief
       analysis of the internal security arrangements under the National Security Council, with
       particular reference to the functions, responsibilities and membership of the
       Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference (<gloss target="#t_IIC1">IIC</gloss>) and the
       Interdepartmental Committee on Internal Security (<gloss target="#t_ICIS1">ICIS</gloss>). He
       thereafter indicated that he would confine his presentation to five major problems relating
       to internal security. He added that he would pause at the end of his discussion of each of
       these five problems, to answer any questions.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJP1">Coyne</persName> then analyzed the Communist movement in
       the United States, using charts to illustrate his major points. At the conclusion of this
       discussion the President inquired, apropos of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJP1"
        >Coyne</persName>’s statement that publishing activities helped to provide revenues for the
       Communist Party, USA, what publishing houses were maintained by the Communist Party and what
       kinds of material they published. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJP1">Coyne</persName> and others
       described the publications, and the President then inquired whether such publications were
       clearly tabbed as Communist in character. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJP1">Coyne</persName>
       replied that this was not normally the case, but that it was not difficult to discover their
       character after a brief reading.</p>
      <p>The Vice President inquired as to the character of the firm which published the Matusow
        book.<note n="3" xml:id="d214fn3">Reference is to <persName>Harvey Matusow</persName>, <hi
         rend="italic">False Witness</hi> (New York: Cameron and Kahn, 1955).</note> Mr. <persName

      <pb n="640" xml:id="pg_640" facs="0669"/>
      <p>At the conclusion of this discussion Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJP1">Coyne</persName>
       continued with his presentation, dealing successively with the following subjects: (1) Soviet
       bloc intelligence targets, overt and covert; (2) legal and illegal entry of foreign persons
       and materials into the United States; (3) the security of critical facilities; and (4) the
       security of vital information. (A copy of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJP1">Coyne</persName>’s
       report is filed with the minutes of the meeting.)<note n="4" xml:id="d214fn4">Not
        found.</note></p>
      <p>At the conclusion of the presentation the President referred to the account given by Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_CJP1">Coyne</persName> of the manner in which a Czech courier had
       brought into Idlewild from Montreal six diplomatic pouches containing 1500 pounds of
       contents, while managing to avoid either customs or immigration inspection. The President
       said he could not imagine how an individual with so much material could have avoided some
       kind of customs inspection. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJP1">Coyne</persName> replied that the
       courier in question had simply managed to fool both the customs and immigration officials,
       and had removed his pouches in an automobile which had been sent for that purpose.</p>
      <p>The President said that despite the privileges of diplomatic immunity, would it not be
       right that if we catch an individual planning to evade our regulations, that individual
       should lose his diplomatic inviolability?</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJP1">Coyne</persName> said that he would prefer that members of
       the State Department answer the President’s question. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HH1"
        >Hoover</persName> stated that while it would be possible to go after a particular man, it
       would be extremely difficult to change the system which allowed for the inviolability of the
       diplomatic pouch. We could declare an individual persona non grata. Mr.
        <persName>Rose</persName>,<note n="5" xml:id="d214fn5"><persName>H. Chapman Rose</persName>,
        Assistant Secretary of the Treasury.</note> acting for the Secretary of the Treasury,
       recalled the circumstances of the case Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJP1">Coyne</persName> had
       cited, and indicated that the Embassy of Czechoslovakia had firmly denied that its courier
       had evaded regulations.</p>
      <p>The President said he was sure of at least one thing. He would not feel that he was a very
       good and effective administrator if he could not think up some way to delay such an
       individual as this Czech courier long enough to discover what were the contents of his
       baggage and pouches without actually opening them.</p>
      <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that was it not obvious that
       there was consistent abuse of the pouch privilege by Soviet bloc people. The President
       replied that of course they consistently abused the privilege, but the difficulty was that
       the United States in turn was dependent on being able to transmit diplomatic pouches to and
       from its missions in countries behind the Iron Curtain. Indeed, in one respect at least it
        <pb n="641" xml:id="pg_641" facs="0670"/>needed these pouches more than the Soviet bloc
       diplomats, because it was necessary in many cases to send food in the pouches.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> said that he was convinced that
       there were certain additional steps which the United States could take to reduce Soviet bloc
       abuse of the pouch privilege, although, he said, many of his people in the Central
       Intelligence Agency did not agree with this point of view.</p>
      <p>The President said that he hated to be a sucker when he knew that the other fellow was
       fooling and abusing him.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJP1">Coyne</persName> assured the President that certain members
       of the Council, including <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>, not to
       mention the members of the two internal security committees, were hard at work to see what
       additional actions we could take to cope with this problem</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said that he was indeed interested,
       and had tried to canvass the three Services as to possible reduction of their dependence on
       pouch material sent to Washington by the Military Attachés. He had not been very successful
       in persuading them that it was unnecessary to rely so heavily on this pouch material.
       Nevertheless, he still felt personally that the United States loses more than it gains by its
       strict adherence to the inviolability of the diplomatic pouch as a means of securing
       intelligence materials on the Soviet bloc.</p>
      <p>The President said that he thought it would be a good idea to contact our Embassies in the
       Soviet bloc countries and to ascertain from them just how important our own pouches really
       are. If this importance proved not to be vital, we might contemplate new regulations. In any
       event, said the President, he admitted that the problem of controlling abuse of the pouch was
       not as easy as it looked on the surface.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName>Dillon Anderson</persName> then inquired of the President whether he wished
       further study and recommendations by the two internal security committees on this subject.
       The Attorney General, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJE1">J. Edgar Hoover</persName> and Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_CJP1">Coyne</persName> pointed out that the two committees were
       already engaged in restudying the problem.</p>
      <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>, reverting to the problem of
       illegal entries into the United States from foreign countries, which Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_CJP1">Coyne</persName> had underlined, inquired whether the time may not be
       close at hand when everyone in the United States must be compelled to have an identification
       card. It might, for example, be possible to insist on such identification cards under cover
       of the requirements for civil defense. The President replied that of course the system of
       identification cards had been common in many European countries for a good many years, but he
       believed that an attempt to introduce this system in the United States would raise a great
       political storm, although it might be possible to get by with a civil defense cover.</p>

           exploitation excessive?</p>
          <p>[Answer]<note n="5" xml:id="d217fn5">Brackets in the original.</note> It has been the
           experience of this Office that economic exploitation requirements are usually fulfilled
           by the following general categories of exploitation facilities:</p>
          <p>[<hi rend="italic">Heading and 1 paragraph (10 lines) not declassified</hi>]</p>
          <p>2) <hi rend="italic">Exploitation Facilities of the Armed Services</hi></p>
          <p>The <gloss target="#t_SOVMAT1">Sovmat</gloss> Staff has direct contact with the
           separate Services through their representation to the Joint Technical Intelligence
           Subcommittee (<gloss target="#t_JTIS1">JTIS</gloss>). After serving our exploitation
           requirements on the Services, the <gloss target="#t_SOVMAT1">Sovmat</gloss> Staff has
           indicated by memoranda to this Office that they have no further responsibility for the
           requirements and that the Office of Collection and Dissemination is the proper channel
           for obtaining exploitation reports. The exploitation reports prepared by the Services are
           not published in the <gloss target="#t_SOVMAT1">Sovmat</gloss> “<gloss target="#t_OO1"
            >OO</gloss>–T”series, but follow their own format. A check of some of these reports
           which have been received by this Office indicates that the time between receipt of the
           item by the Services and receipt of the published exploitation report will vary between
           one and two years.</p>
          <p>Recently, a <gloss target="#t_JTIS1">JTIS</gloss> publication identified all
           exploitation reports prepared by the various Services and <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
            >CIA</gloss>. According to this publication, the exploitation reports vary in their
           degree of availability and are not all disseminated. There is not sufficient description
           of the reports listed in this publication to indicate whether the exploitation requested
           by this Office has been accomplished.</p>
          <p>An inquiry was made of Liaison Division/<gloss target="#t_DCD1">DCD</gloss> [Domestic
           Contact Division, <gloss target="#t_DDP1">DDP</gloss>]<note n="6" xml:id="d217fn6"
            >Brackets in the original.</note> to ascertain the method by which exploitation reports
           were acquired from the Services in response to our requirements. It was discovered that
            <gloss target="#t_DCD1">DCD</gloss> has no record of the requirements which are served
           on the Services by <gloss target="#t_SOVMAT1">Sovmat</gloss> Staff and has no follow-up
           instruction from the <gloss target="#t_SOVMAT1">Sovmat</gloss> Staff. Hence, no reports
           will be received in direct response to our requirements and we will receive only such
           reports as will be disseminated by the Services.</p>
          <pb n="645" xml:id="pg_645" facs="0674"/>
          <p>A specific document request was made through Liaison Division, OOD for an exploitation
           report on Soviet ammunition, which was described as a “Preliminary Report” by the
           Ordnance Corps and was never disseminated nor was it listed in the <gloss
            target="#t_JTIS1">JTIS</gloss> publication. We discovered that the report contained [<hi
            rend="italic">2 lines not declassified</hi>]. Such information was of considerable value
           to this Office. A similar situation was discovered in requesting a non-disseminated
           report from another Service with respect to Soviet ball bearings.</p>
          <p>Under these circumstances, the time interval between levying requirements and the
           receipt of exploitation reports is certainly excessive and there is no certainty that an
           exploitation report will be received, or if exploitation is accomplished, that it will
           include our requirements.</p>
          <p>3) <hi rend="italic">Exploitation Facilities of Non-Military Government
           Agencies</hi></p>
          <p>This Office does not consider the time interval between levying requirements and

          <p>The <gloss target="#t_SOVMAT1">Sovmat</gloss> Staff notifies this Office of the cost of
           exploitation only in those instances where in their judgment there is an unusual charge
           or where they feel that additional justification, other than the requirement, is
           warranted. This Office has, therefore, no knowledge of the exploitation cost of a great
           majority of the exploitation accomplished in response to our requirements.</p>
          <p>In most instances where this Office has been made aware of the exploitation cost, it
           does appear that there is excessive cost for the exploitation contemplated in a number of
           our requirements and the best and most economical means are not always used for
           exploitation. It is felt that greater reliance should be placed on this Office by the
            <gloss target="#t_SOVMAT1">Sovmat</gloss> Staff for substantive guidance, interpretation
           of our requirements, and suggestions for exploiting facilities and companies with a view
           toward minimizing the cost of exploitation.</p>
          <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (16 lines) not declassified</hi>]</p>
          <p>There are additional instances which have tended to create the impression in this
           Office that the cost of exploitation is excessive. As for example, where we had requested
           that an exploiting facility prepare a brief evaluation of a <gloss target="#t_SOVMAT1"
            >Sovmat</gloss> item, the exploitation report forwarded by the <gloss
            target="#t_SOVMAT1">Sovmat</gloss> Staff for evaluation by this Office contained the
           results of elaborate testing and comprehensive technical description, far in excess of
           our request. On the exploitation reports, the Office checked to evaluate the reports in
           the requesting Office or an Office with a major interest. Since this Office was the only
           Office requested to evaluate, it was presumed that we were the only requester. On other
           exploitation reports where ORR and OSI [the Office of Scientific Intelligence, <pb

           interested analysts of the two Offices has revealed that the report goes far beyond the

          <p>This Office has frequently made suggestions to the <gloss target="#t_SOVMAT1"
            >Sovmat</gloss> Staff for improvement in the <gloss target="#t_SOVMAT1">Sovmat</gloss>
           Program through regular channels. For example, in January 1954 this Office forwarded
           comments by Ambassador [<persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Joseph</persName>]<note n="8"
            xml:id="d217fn8">Brackets in the original.</note> Flack of Embassy Warsaw and Mr.

           difficulties in the <gloss target="#t_SOVMAT1">Sovmat</gloss> Program. Comments received
           by this Office from returning attachés and State personnel regarding lack of adequate
           collection guidance have been informally discussed with the <gloss target="#t_SOVMAT1"
            >Sovmat</gloss> Staff. A continuous flow of evaluations from this Office call to the

           the exploitation reports might better be focused on requirements of this
          Office.</p></item>
        </list></item>
      </list>
      <p>Some of the major suggestions of this Office which might be considered for improvement of
       the <gloss target="#t_SOVMAT1">Sovmat</gloss> Program are outlined below and stem in part
       from the comments in preceding paragraphs: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>The <gloss target="#t_SOVMAT1">Sovmat</gloss> Staff should arrange for adequate
         follow-up on exploitation requirements served on the Services to insure, insofar as
         possible, that the requirements are accomplished by the Services and that exploitation
         reports are received in response to these requirements.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>The <gloss target="#t_SOVMAT1">Sovmat</gloss> Staff should provide exploitation cost
         information and whenever possible, total procurement costs to enable the requesting Offices
         to consider this factor in the preparation of the periodic revisions of the <gloss
          target="#t_SOVMAT1">Sovmat</gloss> Collection Guide. This information will have a direct
         influence in the preparation of collection requests for the same or similar items. In this
         way, adequate prior consideration will be given to insure that the value of the information
         to be derived from the item is commensurate with the cost of procurement and
         exploitation.</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>The <gloss target="#t_SOVMAT1">Sovmat</gloss> Staff should utilize the special
         knowledge of the requesting Offices for substantive guidance, interpretation of
         requirements, and suggestions for exploiting facilities. It cannot be expected that the
         Offices can provide adequate support to the <gloss target="#t_SOVMAT1">Sovmat</gloss> Staff
         in a mere exchange of memoranda. [<hi rend="italic">19 lines not declassified</hi>]</item>
        <pb n="647" xml:id="pg_647" facs="0676"/>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item>Greater emphasis should be made by the <gloss target="#t_SOVMAT1">Sovmat</gloss> Staff
         in coordinating the common interests of several Offices in certain types of items to
         establish periodic collection and standard exploitation of the items. This would eliminate
         any possibility of duplication of collection, incomplete exploitation, and excessive
         administrative and exploitation costs. As examples of programs which can be effected where
         there is this community of interest in similar items, [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not
          declassified</hi>] there is mutual interest in the same type products. Standard collection
         procedures have been arranged. The result is a minimum of administrative detail and cost
         and complete and satisfactory exploitation for all interested Agencies.</item>
        <label>5.</label>
        <item>The <gloss target="#t_SOVMAT1">Sovmat</gloss> Staff should take greater advantage of
         the suggested exploitation section of the [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>]
         in order to anticipate exploitation for those items which are expected to be purchased or
         have been purchased and are awaiting shipment.</item>
        <label>6.</label>
        <item>The <gloss target="#t_SOVMAT1">Sovmat</gloss> Staff should consider the practicality
         of having one or two industry experts evaluate an item at <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
          >CIA</gloss> facilities together with representatives of the respecting Offices prior to
         formulation of extensive exploitation requirements. An example of the value of this
         practice can be shown in the examination of a [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not
          declassified</hi>]. This examination evaluation precluded costly and comprehensive
         exploitation.</item>
        <label>7.</label>
        <item>The <gloss target="#t_SOVMAT1">Sovmat</gloss> Staff should provide more adequate
         collection support and cooperation in those instances where high priority collection and
         exploitation is required by this Office. As an example of the lack of cooperation and
         support we have received from the <gloss target="#t_SOVMAT1">Sovmat</gloss> Staff in this
         respect, our recent priority requirements for collection and exploitation of a [<hi
          rend="italic">10 lines not declassified</hi>]. Furthermore, the <gloss target="#t_SOVMAT1"
          >Sovmat</gloss> Staff advised this Office that they preferred to rely on existing
         procedures for such collection and exploitation. As we could not provide detailed
         information on the collection of the sample and because of the reluctance of the <gloss
          target="#t_SOVMAT1">Sovmat</gloss> Staff to interfere with regular channels, we were
         required to obtain the information on the basis of informal relationships and outside of
         liaison channels which were available to the <gloss target="#t_SOVMAT1">Sovmat</gloss>
         Staff.</item>

        and agencies involved.” It also noted, however, that “the task force was severely hampered
        by the security restrictions imposed upon it in its survey of the clandestine operations of

      <p rend="center">Scope of the Study</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">“Intelligence”—A Definition</hi></p>
      <p>The fate of the nation well may rest on accurate and complete intelligence data which may
       serve as a trustworthy guide for top-level governmental decisions on policy and action in a
       troubled world where so many forces and ideologies work at cross purposes.</p>
      <p>The Congress has recognized the importance of the role of intelligence in our national
       security. It has authorized the expenditure of vast <pb n="652" xml:id="pg_652" facs="0681"
       />sums of money by appropriate departments and agencies to carry on this work.</p>
      <p>Immediately after World War II, at the suggestion of the Chief Executive of our Government,
       the Congress approved the creation of a new agency unique and in many ways strange to our
       democratic form of government. It is known as the Central Intelligence Agency (<gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>).</p>
      <p>The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> operates without the customary legislative
       restraints and reins under which other departments must function. Its work is veiled in
       secrecy, and it is virtually a law unto itself.</p>
      <p>In order to evaluate the extent and effectiveness of intelligence as carried out under
       these conditions, the Task Force on Intelligence Activities found that it was confronted at
       the outset with the problem of arriving at a common understanding and agreement on the
       meaning of the word “intelligence,” as applied to its own areas of work and
       investigation.</p>
      <p>The word has many definitions and is subject to varying shades of interpretation and
       meaning. In a certain context it might refer to “ability to learn”; in another context,
       “intellect,” or perhaps “ability to meet a new situation”; and in yet another sense, “common
       sense.”</p>
      <p>In the search for an acceptable definition as applied to our own field of study, it was
       found that each department or agency surveyed had its own definition. Many of these
       definitions were lengthy, and involved use of words requiring additional interpretation or
       delimitation to get to their precise application.</p>
      <p>The task force sought a definition as simple and clear as possible and arrived at the
       following: <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“Intelligence deals with all the things which should be known in advance of initiating a
         course of action.”</p>
       </quote></p>
      <p>Useful for our purposes, also, as a supplemental and expanded definition is that given in
       the Dictionary of United States Military Terms for Joint Usage: <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“INTELLIGENCE—The product resulting from the collection, evaluation, analysis,

         potentially significant to planning.”</p>

      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Scope of Task Force Study Refined</hi></p>
      <p>Initially, this task force was instructed by the Commission on Organization of the
       Executive Branch of the Government, hereinafter referred to as the Commission or the
        <persName corresp="#p_HH1">Hoover</persName> Commission, to study and make recommendations
       as to the structure and administration <pb n="653" xml:id="pg_653" facs="0682"/>of the
       Central Intelligence Agency and other kindred intelligence activities.</p>
      <p>Later, those instructions were changed by the Commission to embrace studies of <hi
        rend="italic">all</hi> intelligence activities of the Federal Government and to submit
       recommendations to effect changes considered necessary to promote economy, efficiency, and
       improved service in this field.</p>
      <p>The task force gave thorough consideration to the decision of the Commission to broaden the
       scope of the task-force studies to include all intelligence activities of the Federal
       Government. It developed that there are at least twelve major departments and agencies which,
       in one manner or another, are engaged in intelligence. Among these are the Department of
       State, the Department of Defense (including the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Joint Chiefs of
       Staff), the Central Intelligence Agency, the Atomic Energy Commission, the Department of
       Commerce, and the Department of Agriculture. In addition, there are ten or more minor
       agencies or activities which expend public funds directly or indirectly on behalf of the
       intelligence effort of the Government.</p>
      <p>Thus, under the broad definition of its terms of reference, the task force was confronted
       with the Herculean job of studying and reporting on more than twenty major and minor
       departments and agencies. It readily became apparent that any attempt to spread the efforts
       of the task force over such a large area would mean either that only minor results could be
       expected within the allotted time or the work period should be extended beyond the date
       contemplated for dissolution of the Commission on May 31, 1955. Therefore, it was apparent
       that the scope of the task-force work had to be refined if any useful results were to be
       derived from its efforts and expenditure of funds.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Positive Foreign Intelligence Vital</hi></p>
      <p>The most pressing need under present conditions is for those officials in responsible
       positions in Government, especially those responsible for foreign policy, to have readily
       available full and factual foreign intelligence. The word “foreign” as used here denotes the
       target of information as distinct from the geographical source.</p>
      <p>Thus, it appeared to the task force that within the given time limit the best interests of
       the Government would be served if the task force directed its attention to the departments
       and agencies whose entire or primary responsibilities lie in the field of positive foreign
       intelligence as it pertains to national defense and security, and in whose care vast sums of
       money and unique authority have been entrusted. These are the Department of State, the
       Department of Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Council, the
       Federal Bureau of Investigation (to the extent that it deals in security intelligence), and
       the intelligence activities of the Atomic Energy Commission.</p>

      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Directive to the Task Force</hi></p>
      <p>Accordingly, a proposal to delimit the scope of the task-force studies was made to and

       </list></p>
      <pb n="655" xml:id="pg_655" facs="0684"/>
      <p>This requires a determination in the basic surveys outlined in paragraphs 1 to 5 as to what
       services, activities, and functions are being performed by each agency studied. Upon
       completion of the basic surveys, a functional survey of the work done by the agencies would
       be undertaken from the data developed. With such a scope, the task force would cover, among
       other things: <list>

         coverage, mutual support of one another.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>In the execution of this extensive undertaking, the task force, in certain areas, had to
       employ the “sampling” method, particularly in the case of the study of those activities of
       the agencies overseas.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Sensitive Portions of Agencies Surveyed</hi></p>
      <p>In giving its approval of the foregoing proposal, the Commission directed that a first
       paragraph be added as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“1. The study and survey of the sensitive portions of the agencies will be undertaken by
          <persName corresp="#p_CGRM1">General Clark</persName> with a minimum staff on a
         ‘need-to-know’ basis.”</p>
       </quote></p>
      <p>Pursuant to the foregoing directive, arrangements were made orally between Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and
        <persName corresp="#p_CGRM1">General Mark W. Clark</persName>, chairman of the Task Force on
       Intelligence Activities, initially for <persName corresp="#p_CGRM1">General Clark</persName>
       and Colonel <persName>Herman O. Lane</persName>, a member of the task-force staff, to have
       access to <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> activities, both overt and covert. Shortly
       after this arrangement was implemented, it developed that a requirement existed for at least
       one additional member of the task force to have access to covert activities of the agency.
       Accordingly, <persName corresp="#p_CARL1">Admiral Richard L. Connolly</persName>’s name was
       added to the list.</p>
      <p>This arrangement continued until a decision was made that certain members of the task force
       and staff should inspect intelligence activities in the European and Far East areas. Since
        <persName corresp="#p_CGRM1">General Clark</persName> was <pb n="656" xml:id="pg_656"
        facs="0685"/>unable to take part in one of these inspection trips, the problem confronting
       the task forces, as a result of the existing restrictions on the clearance of the task force
       to sensitive material of the agency, was presented to the Director of Central Intelligence.
       The following quoted letter was received from the director:</p>

      <p rend="flushleft">Dear <persName>General Christiansen</persName>:</p>
      <p>With further reference to your letter of 20 January 1955,<note n="2" xml:id="d220fn2">Not

       your trip to the Pacific area. It is also understood that all members of the Task Force and

       activities of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> which may be submitted by those members
       of your staff who have been cleared for on-the-spot investigation of those activities. I
       quite appreciate that this is necessary in connection with the preparation of the Task Force
       report.</p>
      <p>This procedure has been cleared with Governor <persName corresp="#p_AS1"

       <head>Cost of the Intelligence Effort</head>
       <p>Precise figures on the cost in money and manpower engaged in intelligence activities in
        the interest of national defense and security are not a matter of record. Any attempt to
        compile such data accurately would require the expenditure of money out of all proportion to
        the value of the findings. The task force estimates, however, that the annual expenditure is
        in the order of $800 million.</p>
       <pb n="657" xml:id="pg_657" facs="0686"/>
       <p rend="center">Organization of the Task Force</p>
       <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Security Impact on Selection of Personnel</hi></p>
       <p>The Task Force on Intelligence Activities was the last to be authorized by the <persName
         corresp="#p_HH1">Hoover</persName> Commission. The director and deputy of the staff assumed
        their duties on October 1, 1954. The limited pool of available personnel in the United
        States with prior experience in the intelligence field influenced to some extent the
        structure of the staff and its methods of operation.</p>
       <p>Personnel of the Intelligence Task Force and of the staff had to be screened carefully for
        background security and possible prejudicial interest arising from prior association with
        departments and agencies under investigation.</p>
       <p>Before a member of the task force or staff could have access to any material, a security
        background investigation was conducted and the individual declared by proper authority to be
        eligible for access to “Top Secret” information. In each case where the inquiry involved
        access to atomic energy data, a special clearance was obtained.</p>
       <p>It was found that each department and agency had evolved its criteria, practices, and
        standards for clearance. The task force adopted a policy in conformity with the policies and
        requirements of the department or agency involved in each specific investigation.</p>
       <p>In the interest of security and economy, the task force also decided to keep its staff as
        compact as possible. Sensitive material was studied generally on the premises of the
        agencies.</p>
       <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Staff Organization</hi></p>
       <p>After careful consideration by the task force of the possible methods of organizing the
        staff and its work, it was decided that the most practical course would be to assign some
        teams composed of one or two staff members to study specific agencies, and to delegate to
        other teams specific across-the-board survey functions. Individual task force members were
        assigned across-the-board responsibilities paralleling the work of designated staff teams.
        Thus, all members would be in a position to interject their influence and guidance in the
        staff activities and at the same time obtain valuable first-hand knowledge of the overall
        problem.</p>
       <p>Initially, five staff study groups were organized. Some were assigned responsibility for
        study of a single department; others, where feasible, covered two or more agencies.</p>
       <p>The restrictions imposed on the staff in its survey of the Central Intelligence Agency
        necessitated that the work be broken down into two classifications, with one group studying
        the covert aspects of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, and the other surveying the overt
        operations of the Agency. These two teams carefully coordinated and correlated their
        studies, except where <pb n="658" xml:id="pg_658" facs="0687"/>information on the more
        sensitive areas of the Agency’s work was restricted to designated individuals. This
        arrangement proved very cumbersome, was time-consuming, and seriously interfered with the
        conduct of the survey.</p>
       <p>As each task group completed the study of a particular department or agency, it was
        assigned to studies of specific functions common to two or more agencies.</p>
       <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Procedures for Gathering Data</hi></p>
       <p>The task force scrupulously avoided the use of questionnaires. The statistical matter
        which appears throughout this report was extracted from documentary files maintained by the
        departments and agencies.</p>
       <p>The task force and staff had the benefit of detailed briefings by each agency studied.
        These briefings were characterized by informality. Oral questions and answers were the rule
        rather than the exception. No verbatim transcriptions of the conversations and comments of
        witnesses were deemed necessary. In some instances, however, copies of the prepared
        briefings were furnished to the staff for ready reference.</p>
       <p>Discussions were had with all echelons of personnel in each department and agency, from
        the clerk at the working level to and including the Secretary of State, the Secretary and
        Deputy Secretary of Defense, and the Director of Central Intelligence.</p>
       <p>The task force also had the benefit of expert advice from many individuals who are not in
        Government employ but who previously occupied positions of prime responsibility in the
        development of our present intelligence operations and organization. Their help and advice
        were of inestimable value.</p>
       <p>Some of these witnesses appeared before the task force at no expense to the Government and
        at considerable personal sacrifice. The task force wishes to express its unqualified
        appreciation to these public-spirited individuals in private life who gave freely of their
        time, and who by their objective approach to the problem materially enlightened the task
        force.</p>
       <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Teams Make First-Hand Studies Abroad</hi></p>
       <p>In order to obtain a clearer picture of intelligence operations, two teams, each composed
        of a member or members of the task force and members of the staff, were sent abroad for
        on-the-spot investigations. One team visited the European sector and the other went to the
        Far East.</p>
       <p>These staff groups had discussions with the senior United States representatives, senior
        military commanders, and representatives of the Central Intelligence Agency in the countries
        visited. The visits and discussions afforded the task force first-hand information which
        could be obtained in no other fashion.</p>

        they are incorporated in the functions of the Assistant Secretary of Research and

        field between the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Office of Defense Mobilization, except
        through the representation of the Secretary of Defense in the National Security Council. As
        far as the intelligence relations between the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Central
        Intelligence Agency on working levels are concerned, they are implicit in the representation
        of the joint intelligence group of the Joint Staff, Joint Chiefs of Staff, on the

        relationships will be discussed more fully in this report in the section devoted to the

         compartmentalization for security reasons, and because of the fact that the agency is now
         scattered among thirty-four buildings. This administrative overhead is a matter of constant
         concern and study to the agency. Plans for new construction have been initiated and funds
         will be requested.</item>

        <item>“The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>’s main problem is one of securing and
         retaining qualified personnel. This is also true of other intelligence agencies.” The
         securing and retaining of qualified personnel has been largely solved by the agency as it
         has had sufficient funds to attract the best qualified people, sometimes, unfortunately, at
         the expense of the intelligence agencies of the three services. This situation will be
         discussed more fully in the section covering the Central Intelligence Agency and the
         military services.</item>

        <item>“The services must rid their intelligence estimates of service bias.” Attempts on the
         part of service intelligence agencies to present honest intelligence estimates particular
         to that agency are sometimes “slanted” by the command echelons of the services in support
         of budgetary requests. This tendency should not be charged to intelligence agencies, which
         on the whole, are doing an honest job as far as this task force has been able to

         exercised by him over components of the Army, Navy, and Air Force assigned to the same
         command (see Appendix II). The task force believes that the seriousness of this

         basis, considerations of foreign policy, intelligence, scientific research and development,
         and economic capabilities.” This recommendation is substantially the same as the
         recommendation of the commission, and the results will be discussed in the sections of this
         report devoted to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>“That the Secretary of Defense be the sole representative of the national military

         secretaries, although not members, should also be invited to attend council meetings in
         appropriate circumstances.” The National Security Act of 1947, as amended, now provides
         that the Secretary of Defense is the sole National Defense Establishment member. However,
         secretaries and under secretaries of the military departments may serve as members at the
         pleasure of the President. <pb n="663" xml:id="pg_663" facs="0692"/>The law also provides
         that the Joint Chiefs of Staff will be the principal military advisers to the President,
         the National Security Council, and the Secretary of Defense. It has been observed by this
         task force that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff habitually attends the meetings
         of the National Security Council and the other members attend for those items in which the
         Joint Chiefs are concerned. When departmental matters are before the Council which are of
         concern to the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, or Air Force, the secretary concerned will be

         improve the quality of scientific and medical intelligence. The Office of Scientific
         Intelligence is adequately staffed to include medical personnel. In the quality of its
         products, this agency is definitely handicapped by the inability of the intelligence
         community as a whole to collect information from the Soviet bloc. The Office of National
         Estimates is a top-echelon evaluation board, composed of competent and experienced
         personnel with no administrative responsibilities and whose duties are confined solely to
         intelligence evaluation, the product of which appears in the form of national estimates.
         Specific recommendations with regard to deficiencies in the relations of the Central

       <p rend="center">INTRODUCTION</p>
       <p>The machinery for accomplishing our intelligence objectives, hereinafter called the
        intelligence community when referred to as a whole, includes the Central Intelligence
        Agency, the National Security Council, <pb n="664" xml:id="pg_664" facs="0693"/>the National
        Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the intelligence sections of the
        Department of State, of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force, and of the Atomic Energy
        Commission. Some of these agencies approach or exceed the operations of the <gloss
         target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> in functions and in expenditures. However, since <gloss
         target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is charged with the overall responsibility for coordinating
        the output of all intelligence forces, the task force gave special attention to the work of
        that Agency.</p>
       <p>Our investigations showed that the sensitive and vital work of the intelligence community
        is being led by a group which is sincere, and dedicated to the service of the nation. We
        discovered no valid ground for the suspicion that the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> or
        any other element of the intelligence family was being effectively contaminated by any
        organized subversive or Communistic clique. Charges were made by some individuals alleging a
        few members of the intelligence community to be poor security risks. All such cases, except
        those obviously without merit, were investigated by proper authority, or investigations are
        in the process of being made.</p>
       <p>On the basis of its comprehensive studies, the task force feels that the American people
        can and should give their full confidence and support to the intelligence program, and
        contribute in every possible way to the vital work in which these agencies are engaged. We
        found the Director of Central Intelligence to be industrious, objective, selfless,
        enthusiastic, and imaginative. We are convinced, however, that in his enthusiasm he has
        taken upon himself too many burdensome duties and responsibilities on the operational side
        of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>’s activities. The task force feels that certain
        administrative flaws have developed in the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, which must
        be corrected to give proper emphasis and direction to its basic responsibilities</p>
       <p>The major aim would be greater concentration on the collection of intelligence information
        from our primary target—Russia and her satellites, and Communist China.</p>
       <p>The task force is deeply concerned over the lack of adequate intelligence data from behind
        the Iron Curtain. The information we need on the political plans, scientific progress, and
        military potential of the Communists is there to be had, and we must exert every conceivable
        and practicable effort to get it. Proper directional emphasis, aggressive leadership,
        boldness and persistence are essential to achieve the desired results.</p>
       <p>The glamor and excitement of some angles of our intelligence effort must not be permitted
        to overshadow other vital phases of the work or cause neglect of primary functions. A
        majority of the task force is convinced that an internal reorganization of the <gloss
         target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is necessary to give assurance that each of these functions
        receives adequate attention without diversionary interest.</p>
       <pb n="665" xml:id="pg_665" facs="0694"/>
       <p>The task force further is concerned over the absence of satisfactory machinery for
        surveillance of the stewardship of the Central Intelligence Agency. It is making
        recommendations which it believes will provide the proper type of “watch-dog” commission as
        a means of reestablishing that relationship between the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
        and the Congress so essential to and characteristic of our democratic form of government,
        but which was abrogated by the enactment of Public Law 110<note n="7" xml:id="d220fn7">A
         reference to the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949, approved June 20, 1949, which
         exempted the Central Intelligence Agency from disclosure of certain information concerning
         its organization such as functions, official titles, and number of personnel. (63 Stat.
         208)</note> and other statutes relating to the Agency. It would include representatives of
        both Houses of Congress and of the Chief Executive. Its duties would embrace a review of the
        operations and effectiveness not only of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, but also
        of all other intelligence agencies.</p>
       <p>One of the aims in the creation of a compact commission of this type would be to keep the
        public assured of the essential and trustworthy accomplishments of our intelligence forces,
        and to enlist public support and participation in the intelligence effort.</p>
       <p>Action of this sort is needed to promote a general awareness and appreciation among the
        people of the significance and objectives of the intelligence program. There is a corollary
        demand for clarification of misunderstandings which have arisen in the public mind, largely
        as a result of the misapplication of secrecy. However, it must be recognized that
        intelligence operations require a large element of secrecy as an essential to success.</p>
       <p>The task force further is greatly concerned about the inadequate guidance being given to
         <gloss target="#t_NSA1">NSA</gloss> by the United States Communication Intelligence Board,
        and about certain aspects of communications. Recommendations to improve the current status
        are made in Appendix I, Parts 1 and 2.</p>
       <p>The intelligence community should draw more widely on the available pool of retired
        citizens with wide previous business experience in the foreign field, and among retired
        military personnel who have specialized over a long period in the intelligence field. It
        should develop a more attractive program of career incentives for its officials, and of
        benefits for its overseas employees.</p>
       <p>Recommendations to achieve these desirable results are being offered by the task
        force.</p>

       public assured of the essential and trustworthy accomplishments of our Intelligence forces,
       and to enlist public support and participation in the Intelligence effort.</p>
      <p>Action of this sort is needed to promote a general awareness and appreciation among the
       people of the significance and objectives of the Intelligence program. There is a corollary
       demand for clarification of misunderstandings which have arisen in the public mind, largely
       as a result of the misapplication of secrecy. However, it must be recognized that
       Intelligence operations require a large element of secrecy as an essential to success.</p>
      <p>The Intelligence community should draw more widely on the available pool of retired
       citizens with wide previous business experience in the foreign field, and among retired
       military personnel who have specialized over a long period in the Intelligence field. It
       should develop a more attractive program of career incentives for its officials, and of
       benefits for its overseas employees.</p>
      <p>Recommendations to achieve these desirable results are being offered by the task force.</p>
      <pb n="669" xml:id="pg_669" facs="0698"/>
      <p rend="center">Scope of the Studies</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Early Instructions</hi></p>
      <p>Initially, this task force was instructed by the Commission on Organization of the
       Executive Branch of the Government (hereafter referred to as the <persName corresp="#p_HH1"
        >Hoover</persName> Commission or the Commission) to study and make recommendations as to the
       structure and administration of the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
      <p>Later, those instructions were changed by the Commission to embrace studies of <hi
        rend="italic">all</hi> Intelligence operations of the Federal Government and recommendations
       for changes necessary to promote economy, efficiency, and improved service in this field.</p>
      <p>The task force gave thorough consideration to the decision of the Commission to broaden the
       scope of the studies. It found at least 12 major departments and agencies engaged in
       Intelligence in one form or another. In addition, 10 or more minor agencies or activities
       expend public funds directly or indirectly in behalf of the Intelligence effort of the
       Government.</p>
      <p>Thus, under the broad definition of its terms of reference, the task force was confronted
       with the Herculean job of studying and reporting on more than a score of major and minor
       departments and agencies. It quickly became evident that any attempt to spread its
       investigations over such a large area would mean that only sketchy results could be achieved
       within the allotted time.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Task Force Procedure Revised</hi></p>
      <p>The most pressing need under present conditions is for officials in important positions in
       Government, particularly those responsible for foreign policy, to have readily available full
       and factual foreign Intelligence. (The word “foreign” as used here denotes the target of
       information as distinct from the geographical source.)</p>
      <p>Accordingly, the task force suggested to the Commission that the best results could be
       obtained if the dimensions of the inquiry were limited to certain key departments and
       agencies.</p>
      <p>This proposal was approved by the Commission with the understanding that the task force
       would determine which of the Intelligence services, activities, and functions of the agencies
       surveyed it considered essential; those not necessary, or of similar nature and requiring
       consolidation in the public interest; those nonessential and competitive with private
       enterprise; and those representing duplication or overlapping of work between agencies. Under
       this revised program, the task force would cover, among other matters: <list>
        <label>(1)</label>
        <item>The Intelligence functions of the National Security Council.</item>
        <label>(2)</label>

      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Two Reports Prepared</hi></p>
      <p>In the preparation of this report, the task force was motivated by a sincere desire to
       present as complete an account of its findings as considered judgment indicated would best
       serve the public interest. Certain other facts and recommendations prepared by the task force
       have been omitted from this report on the ground that their disclosure publicly might give
       aid and comfort to our potential enemies or might jeopardize our national defense and
       security. These findings have been incorporated in a separate, highly classified,
       comprehensive report which has been placed in the hands of the Chairman of the
       Commission.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Teams Make Firsthand Studies Abroad</hi></p>
      <p>In order to obtain a clearer picture of intelligence operations, two teams were sent abroad
       for on-the-spot investigations. Each team was composed of a member or members of the task
       force and members of the staff. One group visited the European sector and the other went to
       the Far East.</p>
      <p>These staff groups held conferences with the senior United States representatives and
       senior military commanders in the countries visited. The visits and discussions provided the
       task force with firsthand information which could have been obtained in no other fashion.</p>
      <p>The conclusions reached and the recommendations contained in this report, and in the more
       comprehensive report to the Chairman of the Commission, reflect the benefit of those personal
       tours of inspection.</p>
      <p rend="center">Organization of the Task Force</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Security Impact on the Selection of Personnel</hi></p>
      <p>The Task Force on Intelligence Activities was the last investigative group authorized by
       the <persName corresp="#p_HH1">Hoover</persName> Commission. The director and deputy of the
       staff assumed their duties on October 1, 1954. The limited pool of available personnel in
       this country with prior experience in the Intelligence <pb n="671" xml:id="pg_671"
        facs="0700"/>field influenced to some extent the structure of the staff and its methods of
       operation.</p>
      <p>The task force personnel and staff had to be screened carefully for background security and
       possible prejudicial interest arising from prior association with departments and agencies
       embraced in the survey.</p>
      <p>Before a member of the task force or staff could have access to any material, a security
       background investigation was conducted and the individual declared by proper authority to be
       eligible for access to “Top Secret” information. In each case where the inquiry involved
       access to atomic energy data, a time-consuming special clearance was obtained.</p>
      <p>It was found that each department and agency had developed its own criteria, practices, and
       standards for clearance. The task force adopted a policy in conformity with the policies and
       requirements of the department or agency involved in each specific inquiry.</p>
      <p>In the interest of security and economy, the task force also decided to keep its staff as
       compact as possible. Sensitive material generally was studied on the premises of the
       agencies.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Staff Organization</hi></p>
      <p>After careful consideration by the task force of various possible methods of organizing the
       staff and its work, it was decided that the most practical course would be to assign teams
       composed of 1 or 2 staff members to study specific agencies, and to delegate to other teams
       specific across-the-board survey functions. Individual task force members were assigned
       across-the-board responsibilities paralleling the work of designated staff teams.</p>
      <p>Thus, all task force members were in a position to interject their influence and guidance
       in the staff activities and at the same time obtain valuable firsthand knowledge of the
       overall problem.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Procedures for Gathering Data</hi></p>
      <p>The task force and staff had the benefit of detailed briefings by top officials and
       employees of each agency studied. These briefings were characterized by informality. Oral
       questions and answers usually were employed. In some instances, however, copies of prepared
       briefings were furnished to the staff for ready reference.</p>
      <p>Discussions were had with many echelons of personnel in each department and agency, from
       the clerks up to and including the heads of the executive departments.</p>
      <p>In the execution of its extensive undertaking, the task force in certain areas found it
       necessary to employ the “sampling” method, particularly in the case of the study of
       activities overseas.</p>
      <p>The task force also received expert advice from many individuals no longer in Government
       employ, but who previously occupied <pb n="672" xml:id="pg_672" facs="0701"/>positions of
       prime responsibility in the development of our present Intelligence operations and
       organization. Some of these witnesses appeared before the task force at no expense to the
       Government and at considerable personal sacrifice. Their help and suggestions were of
       inestimable value.</p>

      <p rend="center">I. The Intelligence Community—National Level</p>
      <p rend="center">The National Security Council</p>
      <p>The function of the National Security Council is to advise the President with respect to
       the integration of domestic, foreign, and military policies relating to the national security
       so as to enable the military services and the other departments and agencies of the
       Government to cooperate more effectively in matters involving national security.</p>
      <p>The Council is composed of the President, the Vice President, the Secretaries of State and
       Defense, the Director of the Foreign Operations Administration, the Director of the Office of
       Defense Mobilization, the Secretaries and Under Secretaries of other executive departments
       and military departments when appointed by the President, to serve at his pleasure.</p>
      <p>The Council, in addition to performing such other functions as the President may direct,
       for the purpose of coordinating more effectively the policies and functions of the
       departments and agencies of the Government relating to national security, subject to the
       direction of the President, shall: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>Assess and appraise the objectives, commitments, and risks of the United States in
         relation to our actual and potential military power, in the interest of national security,

         Government concerned with the national security, and make recommendations to the President
         on these matters.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>In order to accomplish its mission, the National Security Council has at its disposal
       several groups which function in varying degrees within the field of national
       Intelligence.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Duties of Special Assistant to the President</hi></p>
      <p>The Council is linked closely to the President, not only because the Chief Executive is
       Chairman and a member of it, but also because of the designation by him of a Special
       Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs who, as a member of the White House
       Staff, has constant and direct access to the President and enjoys his complete
       confidence.</p>
      <pb n="673" xml:id="pg_673" facs="0702"/>
      <p>This Special Assistant to the President is, in fact if not in name, the Executive Officer
       of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> and is chairman of the highly important Planning
       Board of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>.</p>
      <p>He personally briefs the President on national security affairs, and with the President’s
       approval prepares the agenda for the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meetings. This
       Special Assistant to the President does not preside at any <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
        >NSC</gloss> meeting, but sits (just beneath the Council itself) at the apex of the <gloss
        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> administrative machinery.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Progress in National Intelligence Policies</hi></p>
      <p>The National Security Council has issued several Intelligence directives.<note n="3"
        xml:id="d221fn3">National Security Council Intelligence Directives (<gloss
         target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss>s) issued from 1950–1955 are printed at the end of this
        volume. Earlier directives are in <ref target="frus1945-50Intel"><hi rend="italic">Foreign
          Relations</hi>, 1945–1950</ref>, Emergence of the Intelligence Establishment.</note> They
       express the policy by which the Intelligence effort is guided and coordinated; establish,
       within the Intelligence community, committees for the fulfillment of specific Intelligence
       functions; and pinpoint the responsibility for specific duties in designated fields of
       Intelligence.</p>
      <p>The national Intelligence policy, as expressed in these directives, calls for integration
       of all departmental Intelligence relating to national security through a process of
       coordination of effort by the Director of Central Intelligence and correlation of
       Intelligence by the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
      <p>Other groups have been established as appendages to the Council, through some of which
       Intelligence, advice, and recommendations have been received by the Council for its use in
       advising and making recommendations to the President.</p>
      <p rend="center">The Central Intelligence Agency</p>
      <p>The Central Intelligence Agency, created by the National Security Act of 1947,<note n="4"
        xml:id="d221fn4">61 Stat. 343.</note> is charged with the responsibility of coordinating,
       evaluating, and distributing Intelligence data affecting the national security. The Director
       of Central Intelligence gives advice and recommendations to the National Security Council on
       such matters.</p>
      <p>The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> well may attribute its existence to the surprise
       attack on Pearl Harbor and to the postwar investigation into the part Intelligence or lack of
       Intelligence played in the failure of our military forces to receive adequate and prompt
       warning of the impending Japanese attack.</p>
      <p>That investigation of events leading up to the “day of infamy” impressed upon Congress the
       fact that information necessary to anticipate the attack actually was available to the
       Government; but that there was no system in existence to assure that the information,
       properly <pb n="674" xml:id="pg_674" facs="0703"/>evaluated, would be brought to the
       attention of the President and his chief advisers so that appropriate decisions could be made
       and timely instructions transmitted to the interested military commanders.</p>
      <p>It also demonstrated that in the prewar Government organization no single official was
       responsible for whatever failure of Intelligence was involved; and the blame for the military
       surprise fell, justly or unjustly, on the military commanders present and immediately
       involved in the debacle.</p>
      <p>Therefore, in 1947, when legislation for a national Intelligence organization was being
       considered, there was a widespread feeling among members of the Congress that responsibility
       for the coordination of the production of national Intelligence, as distinguished from
       departmental Intelligence, and for its dissemination, must be centered at one point.</p>
      <p>Creation of the Central Intelligence Agency, with its Director charged with the
       coordination of the Intelligence effort, was authorized to fill this need. The Director of
       Central Intelligence, in the performance of this responsibility, receives pertinent
       information from all branches of the Government engaging in collection of Intelligence,
       including the Atomic Energy Commission.</p>
      <p>The Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 provides for the administration of the Agency
       and grants the Director wide autonomous authority.</p>

      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Authority, Responsibility, and Functions</hi></p>
      <p>The responsibility of the Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Activities in the military
       services is not specifically defined in legislation or Executive order, but is implicit in
       the following provision of the National Security Act of 1947:</p>
      <p>The Secretary of Defense shall be the principal assistant to the President in all matters
       relating to the Department of Defense. Under direction of the President, and subject to the
       provisions of this Act, he shall have direction, authority, and control over the Department
       of Defense.</p>
      <p>The Assistant to the Secretary of Defense (Special Operations) was designated to fulfill a
       requirement for staff participation and representation in matters affecting defense and
       national Intelligence efforts. His authority and responsibilities are set forth in various
       directives and memoranda of the Secretary of Defense.</p>
      <p>The organization is small and is neither intended nor prepared to exercise administrative
       control over day-to-day Intelligence activities of the armed services.</p>

      <p>As an adjunct of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, there is a Joint Intelligence Committee
       composed of the Intelligence chiefs of the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The
       committee members are: the Deputy Director for Intelligence of the Joint Staff, who acts as
       committee chairman; the <gloss target="#t_G21">G–2</gloss> of the Army; the Director of Naval
       Intelligence; and the Director of Intelligence, Air Force.</p>
      <p>The Deputy Director for Intelligence of the Joint Staff heads the Joint Intelligence Group,
       performing the Intelligence functions and duties assigned to him by the Joint Chiefs of Staff
       through the Director of the Joint Staff.</p>
      <p>Inasmuch as the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Joint Staff are within the Department of
       Defense, the Joint Intelligence Group supports the Secretary of Defense in Intelligence
       matters.</p>

      <p>The AC/S, <gloss target="#t_G21">G–2</gloss>, under supervision of the Deputy Chiefs of
       Staff—and of the Comptroller of the Army, within his scope of responsibility—plans,
       coordinates and supervises the collection, evaluation and dissemination of Intelligence
       information pertaining to the war potential, topography, military forces and military
       activities of foreign nations, and the strategic vulnerability of the United States and its
       possessions.</p>
      <p>The AC/S, <gloss target="#t_G21">G–2</gloss>, also gives staff guidance and coordination to
       the Counter-Intelligence Corps (CIC) and to the Army Intelligence Center, (AIC).</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Attaché System</hi></p>
      <p>Army efforts in the Intelligence collection field are carried out largely through its
       Attaché System which maintains stations in many foreign countries.</p>
      <p>Officers are assigned in the Attaché System on a highly selective basis in conformity with
       rigid requirements and standards established for candidates for this type of duty.</p>
      <p>After selection, officers are assigned to language and Intelligence schools to prepare them
       for their assignments.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_G21">G–2</gloss> Training
        Interest</hi></p>
      <p><gloss target="#t_G21">G–2</gloss>’s training interest lies principally in the areas of
       policy guidance and planning. The training division establishes the policies under which
       Intelligence and language schools operate, and monitors their program.</p>
      <pb n="676" xml:id="pg_676" facs="0705"/>
      <p>Elements of the division also monitor training programs in the Intelligence field, which

      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Counter-Intelligence Corps</hi></p>
      <p>This Corps operates under the command of a major general, who is also, in effect, a deputy
       of AC/S, <gloss target="#t_G21">G–2</gloss>, for CIC matters. However, while the Corps
       commander is responsible for certain administrative and security functions, he does not
       exercise a true command control over the personnel of the Corps. Based on the principle that
       security is a function of command, elements of the Corps generally are assigned to field
       units and operate directly under command of the unit to which they are assigned.</p>
      <p>The mission of the CIC is to ferret out any treason, sedition, subversive activity or
       disaffection, and to detect and prevent enemy espionage or sabotage within the Army
       Establishment and its area of jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>In the pursuit of their primary functions, members of the Army’s Counter-Intelligence Corps
       acquire some intelligence data, and these are fed into the Intelligence system.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Relationship to Other Agencies</hi></p>
      <p><gloss target="#t_G21">G–2</gloss> operates generally in a healthy atmosphere of
       cooperation and understanding in its relationship with other segments of the Intelligence
       community. Committee, subcommittee, and working groups provide for ready interchange of
       materiat practices, methods, and other pertinent Intelligence information.</p>
      <p>Much of the effectiveness of this system is achieved through personal contacts. Material of
       an urgent nature can be disseminated throughout the Intelligence community through these
       contacts without being delayed to await scheduled committee meetings. There is positive
       evidence of an aggressive willingness and desire among those engaged at the working level to
       promote the overall Intelligence effort.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Language Training Program</hi></p>
      <p>Language training for the Attaché System and for the Foreign Area Specialist Training
       (FAST) is conducted at the Army Language School in Monterey, Calif. Use also is made of the
       Naval Language School in Washington, D.C., and civilian colleges. The Army conducts language
       courses for CIC personnel at Fort Holabird, Md.</p>

      <p>In the field, three organizations assist in carrying out the Intelligence mission of the
       Navy: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>Naval District Intelligence Officers, who are under <gloss target="#t_ONI1"
          >ONI</gloss>’s management control and operate in the continental United States and in
         certain outlying areas.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>Intelligence organizations within the forces afloat, which, although directly under
         their respective commanders, are still under <gloss target="#t_ONI1">ONI</gloss>’s
         technical supervision.</item>

        <item>The Naval Attaché System, which also is under jurisdiction of the <gloss
          target="#t_ONI1">ONI</gloss>.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>The primary functions of the District Intelligence Officers are the conduct of
       counterintelligence and the implementation of security policies. The District Intelligence
       Officer serves on the staff of his Naval District Commandant, and in certain designated
       districts has additional duty on the staff of the commander of the sea frontier in which his
       district is located. The Naval District Intelligence Offices are <pb n="678" xml:id="pg_678"
        facs="0707"/>the major source of domestic counterintelligence of special concern to the
       Navy.</p>
      <p>In the forces afloat, each area, fleet, type and task force commander, and all flag
       officers exercising command have a staff Intelligence section. This is headed by an
       Intelligence officer who is responsible for the collection, processing, and dissemination of
       Intelligence for the command. <gloss target="#t_ONI1">ONI</gloss> supports their Intelligence
       requirements and assigns them collection missions within their capabilities to execute.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Naval Attaché System</hi></p>
      <p>Naval attachés and their staffs are officially a part of <gloss target="#t_ONI1"
        >ONI</gloss>, but they also have a responsibility to the Ambassador or Minister who is the
       chief of the diplomatic mission to which they are assigned. Normally, attachés are stationed
       only in those countries which are of primary naval interest to <gloss target="#t_ONI1"
        >ONI</gloss>.</p>
      <p>Each of the ambassadors to countries having ports of call for our naval elements would like
       to have a naval attaché to take care of many problems arising from these visits and the
       attendant shore leaves.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Administration</hi></p>
      <p>Administrative work in the Office of Naval Intelligence is handled by the Assistant
       Director of Naval Intelligence, Administration. Manpower and management surveys are conducted
       continuously by this division to maintain efficiency and economy throughout <gloss
        target="#t_ONI1">ONI</gloss>.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">“Special Duty Only”</hi></p>
      <p>Most of the military personnel assigned to Intelligence duties are line officers, not
       specialists. The Military Personnel Act of 1947<note n="5" xml:id="d221fn5">61 Stat.
        512.</note> made provision for Intelligence specialists in the Regular Navy. However, since
       by law none of these “Special Duty Only” officers may succeed to command, and since command
       is the usual stepping stone to flag rank, the “Special Duty Only” class of service is
       unpopular among line officers.</p>
      <p rend="center">Department of the Air Force</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Organization for Intelligence Work</hi></p>
      <p>The civilian staff of the Secretary of the Air Force includes a Special Assistant for
       Intelligence who is responsible for review and evaluation of all matters pertaining to plans,
       policies, and programs relative to the Air Force Intelligence program. He is also charged
       with supervision and ultimate review of the personnel security program, both military and
       civilian.</p>
      <pb n="679" xml:id="pg_679" facs="0708"/>
      <p>The Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations, is responsible for the Air Force Intelligence
       activities, communications activities, and atomic energy matters.</p>
      <p>The Department’s Inspector General is responsible to the Chief of Staff, USAF. Among his
       other duties, he conducts investigations of matters involving major crimes, violations of
       public trust, subversive activities, sabotage and espionage; and performs related
       counterintelligence functions for the Department.</p>
      <p>The Director of Intelligence, Headquarters, USAF, is directly responsible to the Deputy
       Chief of Staff, Operations. This organizational relationship places him in a position
       subordinate to a Deputy Chief of Staff. The interposing of an echelon between the major
       Intelligence element of the Air Force and the Department’s Chief of Staff and certain other
       functional Deputy Chiefs of Staff, such as the Comptroller, affects adversely the efficiency
       of staff operation. Elevation of the Director of Intelligence to the level of Deputy Chief of
       Staff would greatly enhance the prestige of Intelligence in the Air Force. This is a
       desirable and appropriate step in view of the tremendous importance of Intelligence in the
       overall mission of the Air Force.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Air Force Intelligence Training</hi></p>
      <p>Recognizing the need for continuing Intelligence training, the Air Force has established
       such a program for officers and airmen, embracing courses ranging from those of an
       introductory nature to those appropriate for staff officers in higher headquarters.</p>
      <p>In addition to the service schools, college facilities are used for language training and
       special studies. Training courses are also available for Air Force reserve personnel.</p>
      <p>The Air Force training program generally is adequate for current requirements, even in
       technical areas where the personnel turnover is heavy. Periodic studies should be made,
       however, to assure the adequacy of training facilities in relation to worldwide staff
       requirements. The staffing of foreign posts with inadequately trained personnel may be not
       only uneconomical, but might result also in the loss of opportunities to collect
       Intelligence.</p>
      <p rend="center">Department of State</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Responsibility for Foreign Policy</hi></p>
      <p>A primary function of the Secretary of State is to act as principal adviser to the
       President in the determination of American foreign policy and to implement and supervise its
       execution by diplomatic means. By virtue of the authority the Secretary exercises over all
       the activities of the Department and the Foreign Service, he derives principal support for
       the accomplishment of this task from the Under Secretaries, <pb n="680" xml:id="pg_680"
        facs="0709"/>the Administrator of the Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs, the Special
       Assistant—Intelligence, and the Director of the Policy Planning Staff.</p>
      <p>The Special Assistant—Intelligence, with rank equivalent to that of an Assistant Secretary,
       develops and implements a coordinated program for foreign Intelligence for the Department and
       for producing reports essential to determination and execution of foreign policy.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Effect of Diplomacy on the Overall Collection of
        Intelligence</hi></p>
      <p>The task force has recognized the incompatibility in method between the practice of
       diplomacy and the more direct and active operations incident to the collection of
       Intelligence and the conduct of cold war.</p>
      <p>While all contribute to the end in view, conflicts between them must be resolved, usually
       on a high level, and always in the national interest. It must be realized that diplomacy is
       not an end in itself; that, while political ends must be served and unjustifiable risks
       avoided, the collection of Intelligence is a vital element in the fight to preserve our
       national welfare and existence. Instances have come to the attention of the task force where
       too conservative an attitude has prevailed, often to the detriment of vigorous and timely
       action in the field.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Creation of the Intelligence Area</hi></p>
      <p>Prior to World War II, Intelligence for the support of American foreign policy was produced
       by the inadequate research staffs of departmental policy offices which had many other duties
       to perform. Creation of the Intelligence Area of that Department, by Executive Order 9621 of
       September 20, 1945, recognized the need for improving the quality of Intelligence demanded by
       the tense international situation.</p>
      <p>The Secretary of State is a member of the National Security Council. The Intelligence Area
       provides staff assistance to the Secretary and senior policy officers of the Department of
       State, and maintains liaison with the other members of the Intelligence community in the
       discharge of the Department’s responsibility in the total Intelligence program of the
       Government.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Better Quarters Needed</hi></p>
      <p>The Intelligence Area maintains its offices and records in a converted apartment building,
       which does not constitute satisfactory quarters for this special type of work. The cost of
       adequate security measures consequently is high.</p>
      <p>Existing plans for an addition to the New State Building, if approved under the provisions
       of Public Law 519, would improve working conditions and efficiency, produce savings through
       the vacating of leased spaces, and reduce costs of security, maintenance, and miscellaneous
       services for this branch of the Intelligence effort.</p>

      <p rend="center">Federal Bureau of Investigation (<gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss>)</p>
      <p>A Bureau of Investigation was created, under jurisdiction of the Attorney General of the
       United States, by Executive order of July 26, 1908. The policies now followed in the
       administration of the Federal Bureau of Investigation were established in 1924, and in July
       1935, this agency became known as the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
      <p>In view of the limited activities of the <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> in the
       positive and foreign Intelligence fields, a detailed study of this agency was not made.
       However, its functions in the counterintelligence effort were studied with deep interest by
       the task force, in order to fill out the Intelligence picture.</p>
      <p>We found the Director of the <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss>, through his forcefulness,
       initiative, and managerial ability, to have developed his agency into a model organization of
       its kind. We are confident that in the <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> we have a most

       appropriate exchange and coordination of information and action among the various pertinent
       agencies and departments of the Government.</p>
      <p rend="center">III. Foreign Intelligence</p>
      <p rend="center">Evolution of Our Plans</p>
      <p>Traditionally, Americans are a peace-loving people. But, a philosophy of peace is no
       guarantee of peace. In a tortured world where greed, intrigue, and lust for power exist,
       protection of liberty and assurance of survival lie in alertness and strength. Alertness
       involves adequate Intelligence data on which to base adequate preparedness.</p>
      <p>From the beginning, the United States has tried consistently to maintain relationships with
       other countries openly and to refrain from participation in secret treaties. This principle
       likewise established the early pattern for the conduct of our Intelligence activities. The
       collection of information concerning political and military policies and plans of foreign
       governments was accomplished openly and with the full knowledge of the foreign powers. The
       work was performed through the offices of our diplomatic representatives abroad and
       accredited military attachés.</p>
      <p>A substantial volume of material was collected, but there was no machinery at home to pull
       this information together into a cohesive mass and to draw from it logical conclusions upon
       which to base national policy and future plans.</p>
      <p>On July 11, 1941, the Chief Executive, in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed
       Forces, established an Office of the Coordinator of Information to <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p rend="flushleft">collect and analyze information data, military or otherwise, which may
         bear upon national defense strategy; to interpret and correlate such strategic information;
         to make it available to the President and such other officials as the President may
         determine, and to carry out, when requested by the President, such supplementary activities
         as may facilitate the securing of strategic information not available to the
         Government.</p>
       </quote></p>
      <p rend="flushleft">This office came into being only 5 months before Pearl Harbor.</p>
      <p>Through a process of evolution, there finally emerged the Office of Strategic Services as
       an operating agency of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This organization remained intact until the
       end of World War II.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Postwar Organization</hi></p>
      <p>In the fall of 1944, the Chief Executive wrote to the Director of Strategic Services
       requesting recommendations as to the organization of a postwar Intelligence organization. The
       Director submitted a plan <pb n="683" xml:id="pg_683" facs="0712"/>for the creation of a
       central Intelligence service. The plan placed the proposed central Intelligence service in
       the Executive Office of the President and called for the appointment by the President of a
       Director of Intelligence who would discharge and perform his functions and duties under the
       direction and supervision of the President.</p>
      <p>It also provided for the establishment of an Intelligence Advisory Board consisting of the
       Secretaries of State, War, and Navy, and such others as the President deemed necessary. The
       duties of the board would be to advise and assist the Director of Intelligence.</p>
      <p>The plan placed in the hands of the Director the work of coordinating, collecting,
       evaluating, and disseminating Intelligence for national purposes. It also recognized that
       various departments of the Government should have their own Intelligence bureaus for the
       collection and processing of such information and material as might be needed in the
       performance of their daily functions and duties. Each of these bureaus would be under the
       sole control of its department head and would not be encroached upon or impaired by the
       functions granted to any other governmental Intelligence agency.</p>
      <p>The plan further contemplated that in time of war or unlimited emergency, all programs of
       such an agency in areas of actual or projected military operations would be coordinated with
       military plans and be subject to the approval of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; or in case of the
       consolidation of the armed services, under the supreme commander.</p>
      <p rend="center">Functions Divided</p>
      <p>Under the pressure of prompt dissolution of wartime agencies, the Chief Executive, on
       September 20, 1945, divided the functions, personnel, and physical resources of the Office of
       Strategic Services between the State Department and the War Department. The research and
       presentation element was transferred to the State Department, to be absorbed or liquidated so
       that the element would cease to exist on December 31, 1945.<note n="7" xml:id="d221fn7">See

        and administration of U.S. Government intelligence organizations during that
       period.</note></p>
      <p>On January 22, 1946, the Chief Executive created the National Intelligence Authority
       consisting of the Secretaries of State, War, and Navy, and the President’s personal
       representative, to plan, develop, and coordinate Federal foreign Intelligence activities so
       as to assure the most effective accomplishment of the Intelligence mission for national
       security. This presidential directive also created a Central Intelligence Group (<gloss
        target="#t_CIG1">CIG</gloss>) under the direction of a Director of Central Intelligence
        (<gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss>), designated by the President to assist the National
        <pb n="684" xml:id="pg_684" facs="0713"/>Intelligence Authority (<gloss target="#t_NIA1"
        >NIA</gloss>) and to be responsible to it. The directive specified that the head of the
        <gloss target="#t_CIG1">CIG</gloss> would sit as a member of the <gloss target="#t_NIA1"
        >NIA</gloss>.</p>
      <p>It charged the Central Intelligence Group with the task of correlating, evaluating, and
       disseminating Intelligence relating to the national security; with coordinating such
       activities of the Intelligence agencies of the State, War, and Navy Departments as related to
       the national security; and with performing other services of common concern.</p>
      <p>By the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (Public Law 253, 80th Cong., July 26,
       1947), the Congress established a National Security Council (<gloss target="#t_NSC1"
        >NSC</gloss>) which took the place of the old National Intelligence Authority; and created
       under the National Security Council a Central Intelligence Agency (<gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss>) with a Director of Central Intelligence (<gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss>)
       as its head. The National Intelligence Authority ceased to exist.</p>
      <p>Under the provisions of this act, the National Security Council established an Intelligence
       Advisory Committee (<gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss>) made up of the various Intelligence
       chiefs, to advise the Director of Central Intelligence in his efforts to coordinate the
       Intelligence activities of the Nation.</p>
      <p>[Omitted here is Section IV, Intelligence Personnel and Security.]</p>
      <p rend="center">V. “Watchdog” Commission</p>
      <p>The task force fully realizes that the Central Intelligence Agency, as a major fountain of
       Intelligence for the Nation, must of necessity operate in an atmosphere of secrecy and with
       an unusual amount of freedom and independence. Obviously, it cannot achieve its full purpose
       if subjected to open scrutiny and the extensive checks and balances which apply to the
       average governmental agency.</p>
      <p>Because of its peculiar position, the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has been freed by
       the Congress from outside surveillance of its operations and its fiscal accounts. There is
       always a danger that such freedom from restraints could inspire laxity and abuses which might
       prove costly to the American people.</p>
      <p>Although the task force has discovered no indication of abuse of powers by the <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> or other Intelligence agencies, it nevertheless is firmly
       convinced, as a matter of future insurance, that some reliable, systematic review of all the
       agencies and their operations should be provided by congressional action as a checkrein to
       assure both the Congress and the people that this hub of the Intelligence effort is
       functioning in an efficient, effective, and reasonably economical manner.</p>
      <p>Within the Armed Services Committee, there is a liaison channel between the Congress and
        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> which serves a worthy purpose, but which cannot include
       private citizens in its membership and has not attempted to encompass the wide scope of
       service and continuity which this task force considers essential for “watchdog” purposes.</p>
      <pb n="685" xml:id="pg_685" facs="0714"/>
      <p>The task force recognizes that secrecy is necessary for proper operation of our foreign
       Intelligence Activities but is concerned over the possibility of the growth of license and
       abuses of power where disclosure of costs, organization, personnel, and functions are
       precluded by law.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, sporadic investigations in this field might inadvertently result in
       unauthorized disclosure of classified information to the detriment of the Intelligence
       effort. Periodic audits or studies by some qualified, impartial agency would remove both of
       these dangers and would also allay any suspicions and distrust which have developed in the
       public mind by the complete secrecy of these operations. Such a procedure also might serve to
       shield our Intelligence program from unjustifiable attacks upon the agencies concerned, and
       enhance public confidence and support of this vital work.</p>
      <p>The Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 legalized the administrative procedures for the
       Agency. It was passed by the Congress on the unanimous recommendation of the Armed Services
       Committee.</p>
      <p rend="center">Agency Gets Wide Exemptions</p>
      <p>The Act exempts the Agency from compliance with any provision of law limiting transfers of
       appropriations; any requirements for publication or disclosure of the organization,
       functions, names, official titles, salaries or numbers of personnel employed by the Agency;
       and any regulations relating to the expenditure of Government funds.</p>
      <p>The widespread conviction among Members of Congress that this situation should be corrected
       is indicated by the fact that more than a score of resolutions have been introduced in the
       current session calling for a review or watch over our Intelligence activities, usually by a
       large joint committee of the two Houses.</p>
      <p>The task force, however, envisions as the proper agency for this watchdog job a small,
       permanent commission modeled after the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of
       the Government—a bipartisan group including members of both Houses of Congress and
       distinguished private citizens appointed by the President.</p>
      <p>Members chosen from private life to serve on this proposed watchdog commission should come
       from a select group of loyal, qualified, and public-spirited citizens who command the respect
       and confidence of the American people.</p>
      <p>Comprehensive periodic studies of the foreign Intelligence Activities of the United States
       would be made by the commission, with special attention to the questions of whether the
       assigned work of these Intelligence agencies is being carried on efficiently and effectively;
       whether there is any unnecessary overlapping or duplication of effort between civilian and
       military Intelligence agencies; whether the staffs <pb n="686" xml:id="pg_686" facs="0715"
       />are a size justified by their assigned functions and producing the Intelligence required
       for the security of the Nation; whether expenditures are within budget authorizations and in
       keeping with the expressed intent of the Congress; whether fiscal policies and procedures are
       in conformity with sound accounting principles and practices to the maximum extent possible;
       whether any of their activities or policies are in conflict with the foreign policy aims and
       program of the United States; and whether the effort of any of these Intelligence agencies is
       being dissipated or adversely affected by assignment of added functions alien to
       Intelligence. The commission would require a small permanent staff, with the usual provisions
       for employing attorneys, experts, consultants, and auditors, for expenses and for
       compensation of members and employees. It would be empowered to hold hearings and to subpoena
       witnesses, under adequate safeguards to prevent the public disclosure of classified defense
       information which it might receive; but would have the authority to demand and receive from
       any source any information it might need for its own use.</p>
      <p>The overall aim would be the promotion of aggressive leadership which would unify the
       Intelligence effort, make it more productive, and inspire a higher spirit of teamwork through
       elimination of petty competitive jealousies.</p>
      <p rend="center">Would Study Complaints</p>
      <p>The proposed commission should hold itself available to receive and to study all complaints
       against any of our Intelligence agencies; to maintain a familiarity with the activities of
       these agencies as a safeguard against the abuse of their proper functions; to consider
       requests of the agencies for legislation, and, where advisable, to support the needs of the
       Intelligence community before the Congress, and advise the Congress on the effects of
       proposed legislation on our Intelligence effort. An integral part of its duties would be
       reports of its findings and its recommendations to the President and to the Congress annually
       and at such other times as might be appropriate or necessary.</p>
      <p>One of the fundamental purposes of these reports would be to keep the public informed,
       within the bounds of security, of the value and the vital accomplishments of the Intelligence
       community and provide an answer to unfounded complaints and criticisms which have tended to
       arouse fears and distrust of the Intelligence effort in the minds of the people.</p>
      <p>Public support thus engendered certainly would improve the effectiveness of the
       Intelligence operations, and foster public participation in the collection of overt
       Intelligence data. The people who support these operations are entitled to assurance that the
       investment is paying dividends. With such assurance, they would develop an enthusiasm <pb
        n="687" xml:id="pg_687" facs="0716"/>and alertness which could bring in valuable information
       at times to supplement the work of the regular Intelligence forces.</p>
      <p rend="center">VI. Functional Intelligence</p>
      <p rend="center">Map Procurement</p>
      <p>The task force found map requirements and production for Intelligence purposes well
       coordinated. Through the years, there has developed by mutual cooperation among the
       departments and agencies, a committee whose primary function is to prevent duplication in map
       procurement.</p>
      <p>There is established within the Bureau of the Budget an Examiner of Surveys and Maps, who
       coordinates all map-making programs to avoid duplication and overlapping of functions. The
       system seems to be efficient and effective.</p>
      <p>Trustworthy and up-to-date Intelligence cartography is one of the major elements utilized
       in Intelligence operations. The cost of this phase of the work is substantial, but we found
       this expense to be justified by the results achieved.</p>
      <p rend="center">Intelligence Libraries</p>
      <p>On the basis of visits made to the Intelligence libraries maintained by the military
       services, the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, and the State Department, the task force
       believes that these libraries in general are efficiently operated. There is a workable system
       in effect among the agencies for notification of availability and exchange of
       information.</p>
      <p>There has been considerable discussion of the idea of putting all the material in the
       possession of all Intelligence agencies in one central library.</p>
      <p>The value of a library depends on the ready accessibility of its material to the users. Its
       use and effectiveness declines when those who need it must become involved in complicated
       procedures and delays in obtaining material.</p>
      <p>The task force feels that a central library would foster the development of private
       desk-side libraries and the retention by individuals of material for protracted periods, with
       the resultant denial or delay in access to others. Establishment of a central library,
       therefore, seems impracticable.</p>
      <p>However, for the purpose of providing ready reference and more facile access to the various
       Intelligence data by any department or agency, the task force suggests that all departments
       within the Defense Establishment and the Department of State adopt the single-index system
       based on the Intelligence subject code now in use by the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
       and the Air Force libraries. The value of such a standardized procedure probably would be
       well worth the expense involved.</p>
      <pb n="688" xml:id="pg_688" facs="0717"/>
      <p>Various elements in the Intelligence family have come up with divergent definitions and
       interpretations of certain words and phrases in common use by the Intelligence community. The
       resultant confusion could be eliminated by standardization. To that end, the task force
       proposes that the National Security Council produce an agreed glossary of terms and
       definitions and provide for periodic review of this glossary.</p>
      <p rend="center">VII. Conclusions and Recommendations</p>
      <p>In summarizing its findings and its recommendations, the task force at the outset found, in
       general, that the Intelligence effort is being pursued in a diligent and dedicated manner. It
       noted throughout the Intelligence community an atmosphere of urgency and a desire to get on
       with the job of breaking through security barriers erected by our potential enemies.</p>
      <p>However, instances of inefficient practices were disclosed, and recommendations to correct
       them have been made.</p>
      <p>The domestic counterintelligence effort was found to be effectively coordinated among the
       departments and agencies concerned. Positive direction and mutual support are provided
       through the operations of the Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference and the
       Interdepartmental Committee on Internal Security. Specific responsibility in the domestic
       area of each counterintelligence agency is established partially by statute, and is further
       definitively specified by a “Delimitations Agreement” to prevent overlapping and duplication
       of effort.</p>
      <p>Recommendations covering overseas counterintelligence operations, carried out by the
       military services and the Central Intelligence Agency, are contained in our classified
       report.</p>
      <p>The domestic security and counterintelligence functions of the Federal Bureau of
       Investigation were found to be conducted efficiently and effectively. This Bureau renders
       competent and highly cooperative assistance to other Government Intelligence agencies and
       performs an essential and important function in the overall intelligence effort.</p>
      <p>The National Intelligence Survey is an invaluable publication which provides the essential
       elements of basic Intelligence in all areas of the world. While its production involves an
       extensive and expensive effort, all members of the Intelligence community derive an immediate
       benefit from the contributions they make to it and profit from the final product. There
       always will be a continuing requirement for keeping this survey up to date.</p>
      <p rend="center">Administrative Flaws Noted</p>
      <p>The task force concluded that the legislation and organizational setup for Intelligence
       purposes are soundly conceived, but that <pb n="689" xml:id="pg_689" facs="0718"
       />administrative flaws are in evidence. Accordingly, it has pointed most of its suggestions
       in that direction.</p>
      <p>Failure to produce certain elements of Intelligence has been due in part to the restrictive
       effects of some of our national attitudes and policies toward the collection of Intelligence
       so necessary for effective resistance to Soviet aggression. Also, among some of those
       responsible for implementation of our foreign policy by diplomacy and negotiation, there
       seems to exist an abhorrence to anything that might lead to diplomatic or even protocol
       complications.</p>
      <p>This negative attitude, usually at the desk level, at times has stifled initiative and
       action in the collection of Intelligence. Some of these efforts, if permitted to proceed
       properly, might have brought direct and immediate results and made positive contributions to
       the national welfare that would have justified the attendant political risks and possible
       inconsequential diplomatic embarrassment.</p>
      <p rend="center">Data on Soviet Bloc Inadequate</p>
      <p>Security measures adopted by the Communists have been provokingly conceived and boldly
       employed. They have been quite effective in comparison with our security measures, which have
       permitted the collection of vital secrets in this country with relative ease. The information
       we need, particularly for our Armed Forces, is potentially available. Through concentration
       on the prime target we must exert every conceivable and practicable effort to get it. Success
       in this field depends on greater boldness at the policy level, a willingness to accept
       certain calculated political and diplomatic risks, and full use of technological
       capabilities.</p>
      <p>The task force is of the opinion that the Director of Central Intelligence should employ an
       Executive Director, or “chief of staff,” of the Agency so that the <gloss target="#t_DCI1"
        >DCI</gloss> might be relieved of the chore of many day-to-day administrative and
       operational problems, and thus be able to give more time to the broad, overall direction of
       the Agency and the coordination of the entire Intelligence effort.</p>
      <p rend="center">Recommendations With Respect to Personnel</p>
      <p>The effectiveness of our national Intelligence effort is measured to a large degree by the
       character and ability of the personnel, both military and civilian, engaged in this work. The
       diligent and dedicated effort of the Intelligence community was evident to the task
       force.</p>
      <p>Some problems, however, exist in the personnel management field. These problems, taken
       collectively, seriously affect the morale, the availability, and the quality of the
       Intelligence personnel.</p>
      <p>The task force presents detailed recommendations later in this report, with a view to
       improving the prestige of the civilian analyst; <pb n="690" xml:id="pg_690" facs="0719"
       />developing real career incentives in Intelligence; relieving the critical shortage of
       qualified Intelligence personnel by tapping the valuable pool of retired civilian business
       men and experience abroad, and of especially trained and qualified retired military
       personnel; broadening the base of civilian employment to provide greater flexibility of
       recruitment of the best qualified individuals; improving the conditions of service of <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> personnel stationed abroad, and increasing the salaries of
       certain key officials in <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Recommendation No. 1</hi></p>
      <p>That the Central Intelligence Agency be reorganized internally to produce greater emphasis
       on certain of its basic statutory functions;<note n="8" xml:id="d221fn8">Details and
        supporting factual matter relating to this recommendation are contained in the separate

      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Recommendation No. 2</hi></p>
      <p>That a small, permanent bipartisan commission, composed of members of both Houses of the
       Congress and other public-spirited citizens commanding the utmost national respect and
       confidence, be established by act of Congress to make periodic surveys of the organization,
       functions, policies, and results of the Government agencies handling foreign Intelligence
       operations; and to report, under adequate security safeguards, its findings and
       recommendations to the Congress, and to the President, annually and at such other times as
       may be necessary or advisable. The proposed “watchdog” commission should be empowered by law
       to demand and receive any information it needed for its own use. It would be patterned after
       the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government (<persName
        corresp="#p_HH1">Hoover</persName> Commission). Appointments by the President of persons
       from private life to the proposed Commission should be made from a select list of
       distinguished individuals of unquestioned loyalty, integrity, and ability, with records of
       unselfish service to the Nation.</p>
      <p>The tremendous importance to our country of the Intelligence function, and the unpublicized
       and selfless duties performed, demand that the prestige of this function, and of the
       personnel involved, be recognized through the use of adequate career incentives and benefits
       to encourage full development of talent within the Intelligence community.</p>
      <pb n="691" xml:id="pg_691" facs="0720"/>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Recommendation No. 3</hi></p>
      <p>That the Executive Pay Bill of 1949<note n="9" xml:id="d221fn9">P.L. 359, approved October
        15, 1949. (63 Stat. 880)</note> be amended to increase the annual salary of the Director of
       Central Intelligence to the equivalent of the pay of the Deputy Secretary of Defense (now
       $20,000); to bring the compensation of the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence up to
       $17,500, the same as that of most Under Secretaries of the executive branch; and to provide
       operating directors of areas of responsibility in Intelligence with proportionate salaries;
       and</p>
      <p>That the chiefs of the various Intelligence units of the military services be elevated in
       the organizational structure to the level of Deputy Chiefs of Staff in the Army and the Air
       Force, and Deputy Chief of Naval Operations in the Navy; and</p>
      <p>That the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 be amended to provide: <list>

        <item>Additional medical and hospital benefits and services for dependents of <gloss

        <item>Statutory leave benefits (and accumulation of leave) for employees of <gloss
          target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> overseas, as now applied to members of the Foreign
         Service.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>Retired civilians with long business experience in the foreign field constitute a possible
       source of important contributions to the Intelligence effort, and this resource should be
       exploited fully. There is also a valuable reservoir of retired military personnel with
       foreign experience which might well be utilized. One major advantage in the exploitation of
       these groups would be the speed with which they could be fitted into the Intelligence picture
       because they would come in with a large part of the necessary training already behind
       them.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Recommendation No. 4</hi></p>
      <p>That the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 be amended to authorize employment by the
        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> of retired military personnel of the armed services
       without any arbitrary limitation on the number of such employees (the limit now is 15) and
       without regard to the law limiting their compensation; except that such personnel should be
       authorized to accept either their military retirement pay plus any difference between their
       retired pay and the proper pay of the office they would hold in <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss> or the proper pay of the office, but not both; and</p>
      <p>That the Department of Defense make extensive use of Schedule A of the Civil Service
       Regulations (non-competitive appointments) in <pb n="692" xml:id="pg_692" facs="0721"/>the
       employment by the military services of civilian Intelligence analysts and other specialists
       in order to provide the necessary flexibility in the recruitment of qualified civilian
       personnel (to include retired citizens with wide previous business experience in the foreign
       field) and to facilitate the interchange of such personnel between zone of interior
       competitive service and the overseas excepted service.</p>
      <p>The task force is satisfied that the personnel security program and procedures within the
       Intelligence community are adequate to minimize the possibility of security risks and to make
       extremely unlikely their employment in sensitive positions in the Intelligence agencies,
       except in the procedure for systematic rechecking of all personnel to make sure that the
       passage of time has not altered the trustworthiness of any employee, and to make certain that
       none has succumbed to some weakness of intoxicants or sexual perversion, or developed some
       other shortcoming that would disqualify him from further sensitive work. The Federal Bureau
       of Investigation has adequate safeguards against such a danger.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Recommendation No. 5</hi></p>
      <p>That measures be instituted in all agencies for rechecking the security status of all
       personnel engaged in Intelligence activities at periodic intervals not to exceed 5 years in
       any individual case.</p>
      <p>Our Government and its Intelligence forces are not fully exploiting the possibilities of
       valuable military and technological data potentially available in scientific reports and
       technical publications issued in foreign countries. The State Department now is charged with
       this duty. Under this arrangement, we lack adequate collection facilities and staff experts
       to evaluate the material.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Recommendation No. 6</hi></p>
      <p>That the responsibility for procurement of foreign publications and for collection of
       scientific Intelligence be removed from the State Department and placed in the hands of the
        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, with authority to appoint such scientific attachés as
       may be necessary to carry on this work abroad.</p>
      <p>Efficient handling of Intelligence information demands modern quarters for the personnel
       and the records. The Central Intelligence Agency, after 8 years of operation, still lacks
       such facilities.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Recommendation No. 7</hi></p>
      <p>That the Congress appropriate as soon as practicable the funds necessary to construct
       adequate headquarters facilities for <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> in or near
       Washington, D.C.</p>
      <p>The task force believes not only that great care must be taken in the selection of highly
       qualified persons, both technologically and <pb n="693" xml:id="pg_693" facs="0722"
       />Intelligence-wise, for the group supervising atomic energy data, but that changes in the
       group should be made as infrequently as possible.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Recommendation No. 8</hi></p>
      <p>That steps be taken to introduce highly selective methods of choosing members of the
       coordinating committee on atomic energy Intelligence, not only to get the benefit of service
       by the most competent individuals, but also to assure long tenure in this important
       assignment.</p>
      <p>Lack of adequate linguistic preparation often has proved to be a serious handicap to our
       representatives abroad. This became painfully apparent during the Korean war. The ability to
       write and speak the language fluently, and to interpret foreign words and idioms accurately
       always helps an American to get around in an alien land, to win the confidence of its people,
       and to understand them.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Recommendation No. 9</hi></p>
      <p>That a comprehensive, coordinated program be developed to expand linguistic training among
       American citizens serving the Intelligence effort; and</p>
      <p>That the Department of Defense expand and promote language training by offering credit
       toward reserve commissions to ROTC students and drill credit to Reserve personnel for
       completion of selected language courses.</p>

        <p>“We need to examine intelligence data more broadly, or to invent some new technique, for
         the discovery of hoaxes. As a first step, we recommend a National Intelligence Estimate,
         with adequate safeguards, <pb n="695" xml:id="pg_695" facs="0724"/>of our success in
         keeping secret our most useful techniques of intelligence. This estimate would suggest the

      <p>2. Discussion:</p>
      <p>The problem of ascertaining the validity of information concerning the <gloss
        target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, collected through various sources available to us, is a
       continuing one in the intelligence process. Thus, while no attempt has been made in the past
       to prepare a comprehensive estimate concerning Soviet attempts at deception, and the effect
       of such activity on the validity of National Intelligence Estimates, a considerable amount of
       research and analytical time has been expended. This effort could fruitfully be brought to
       bear in the preparation of a study of Soviet success in penetrating our most useful
       techniques of intelligence. A comprehensive study will be initiated through an appropriate
       mechanism. Our initial investigations do not reveal any requirements for additional personnel

          xml:id="d223fn3">”It has become exceedingly difficult to obtain significant information
          from covert operations inside Russia. The security zones at the border, the general
          restrictions in the interior, the thousands of security police, and the innumerable
          informers among the population are brutally effective in limiting the infiltration,
          exfiltration, and usefulness of agents. Therefore, we must more and more depend upon
          science and technology to assist and complement the best efforts of classical
          intelligence.” (National Archives, RG 59, S/S–<gloss target="#t_RD1">RD</gloss> Files: Lot
          71 D 171, The Report to the President of the Technological Capabilities Panel)</note> has
         implicit in it the expansion of clandestine networks in non-communist areas looking to the
         time, perhaps even twenty years from now, when some of these areas may be critically
         important. It suggests the slow and careful preparation of agents in the event of a
         political coup, a threatened coup, or some similar governmental crisis; and finally, the
         use of such agents in legal travel operations against the communist countries and in the
         penetration of communist and pro-communist groups outside of the communist-controlled
         areas.</p>

      <pb n="696" xml:id="pg_696" facs="0725"/>
      <p>It is noted that a recent recapitulation of high-level intelligence efforts with long-term
       potential shows that the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> possesses several score agent
       assets of this type situated in almost every sensitive non-orbit area of the world and in
       many areas which, though not presently significant, could become so in the years to come. It
       is this type of agent facility which has contributed to the success of certain political
       operations which have been reported to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>.</p>
      <p>The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> accepts and endorses the emphasis placed in the
       report on the importance of using individuals of great intelligence, training and experience
        [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines not declassified</hi>]. This type of activity has been a part of
       our operational program for some time but it clearly deserves an effort above that which we
       are now putting forth. It is most difficult to locate people who are not too selfish, too
       insecure, or too naive to produce material of value within such a program. The security
       precautions erected by the Russians, the Chinese and the Satellites have imposed very rigid
       requirements in the selection of such individuals. Therefore, an expansion of our present
       activities is certainly called for, including the availability of additional manpower to make
       possible slow and careful development of highly intelligent penetration agents.</p>
      <p>Laying the groundwork for extensive covert operations in every country available to our
       agents, to the extent outlined above, would require additional effort through intensification
       and limited expansion of our U.S. case officer selection and training facilities, an increase
       in our case officer corps, and a limited broadening of our several support structures
       (administrative, communications, and technical). A general estimate of the proportion of the
       required increases in terms of case officer personnel would be approximately 10%.</p>

       our intelligence estimates are based, to provide better strategic warning, to minimize
       surprise in the kind of attack, and to reduce the danger of gross overestimation or gross
       under-estimation of the threat. To this end, we recommend adoption of a vigorous program for
       the extensive use, in many intelligence procedures, of the most advanced knowledge in science
       and technology.</p>
      <p>2. Discussion:</p>
      <p>The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> agrees with these statements and recommendations.
       The Director of Central Intelligence has developed plans for implementation in the near
       future which will make possible a further step toward the achievement of the objective
       underlying the TCP recommendation, namely: to “use the ultimate in science and technology to
       improve our intelligence take.”</p>
      <p>The Agency has created a permanent Scientific Advisory Board, composed largely of former
       members of the Technological Capabilities Panel, to advise the Director and to supplement
       existing activities.</p>
      <p>The Agency’s plans envisage: <list>
        <label>a.</label>
        <item>The establishment of a suitable unit, with its supporting laboratory facility, to
         insure the continual creation, recognition and application of new scientific and technical

         intelligence,</item>
        <label>b.</label>
        <item>The establishment of procedures for developing the concomitant equipment and

      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Specific Recommendation C. 8</hi></p>
      <p>1. This recommendation reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“Intelligence applications warrant an immediate program leading to very small artificial
         satellites in orbits around the earth. Construction <pb n="698" xml:id="pg_698" facs="0727"
         />of large surveillance satellites must wait upon adequate solutions to some extraordinary
         technical problems in the information gathering and reporting and its power of supply, and
         should wait upon development of the intercontinental ballistic missile rocket propulsion
         system. The ultimate objective of research and development on the large satellite should be
         continuous surveillance that is both extensive and selective and that can give fine scale
         details sufficient for the identification of objects (airplanes, trains, buildings) on the
         ground.”</p>
       </quote></p>
      <p>2. Discussion:</p>
      <p>The psychological warfare value of launching the first earth satellite makes its prompt
       development of great interest to the intelligence community and may make it a crucial event
       in sustaining the international prestige of the United States.</p>
      <p>There is an increasing amount of evidence that the Soviet Union is placing more and more
       emphasis on the successful launching of the satellite. Press and radio statements since
       September 1954 have indicated a growing scientific effort directed toward the successful
       launching of the first satellite. Evidently the Soviet Union has concluded that their
       satellite program can contribute enough prestige of cold war value or knowledge of military
       value to justify the diversion of the necessary skills, scare material and labor from
       immediate military production. If the Soviet effort should prove successful before a similar
       United States effort, there is no doubt but that their propaganda would capitalize on the
       theme of the scientific and industrial superiority of the communist system.</p>
      <p>The successful launching of the first satellite will undoubtedly be an event comparable to
       the first successful release of nuclear energy to the world’s scientific community, and will
       undoubtedly receive comparable publicity throughout the world. Public opinion in both neutral
       and allied states will be centered on the satellite’s development. For centuries scientists
       and laymen have dreamed of exploring outer space. The first successful penetration of space
       will probably be the small satellite vehicle recommended by the Technological Capabilities
       Panel. The nation that first accomplishes this feat will gain incalculable prestige and
       recognition throughout the world.</p>
      <p>The United States’ reputation as the scientific and industrial leader of the world has been
       of immeasurable value in competing against Soviet aims in both neutral and allied states.
       Since the war the reputation of the United States’ scientific community has been sharply
       challenged by Soviet progress and claims. There is little doubt but that the Soviet Union
       would like to surpass our scientific and industrial reputation in order to further her
       influence over neutralist states and to shake the confidence of states allied with the United
       States. If the Soviet Union’s scientists, technicians and industrialists were apparently to
       surpass the United States and first explore outer space, her <pb n="699" xml:id="pg_699"
        facs="0728"/>propaganda machine would have sensational and convincing evidence of Soviet
       superiority.</p>
      <p>If the United States successfully launches the first satellite, it is most important that
       this be done with unquestionable peaceful intent. The Soviet Union will undoubtedly attempt
       to attach hostile motivation to this development in order to cover her own inability to win
       this race. To maximize our cold war gain in prestige and to minimize the effectiveness of
       Soviet accusations, the satellite should be launched in an atmosphere of international good
       will and common scientific interest. For this reason the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
       strongly concurs in the Department of Defense’s suggestion that a civilian agency such as the
       U.S. National Committee of the IGY supervise its development and that an effort be made to
       release some of the knowledge to the international scientific community.</p>
      <p>The small scientific vehicle is also a necessary step in the development of a larger
       satellite that could possibly provide early warning information through continuous electronic
       and photographic surveillance of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. A future
       satellite that could directly collect intelligence data would be of great interest to the
       intelligence community.</p>
      <p>The Department of Defense has consulted with the Agency, and we are aware of their
       recommendations, which have our full concurrence and strong support.</p>

       <label>c.</label>
       <item>The Air Force member referred to the Air Force program to attack the problem more
        broadly and indicated that while collection was an important aspect of the problem, there
        also were possibilities in the field of research and analysis. He suggested that an
        alternative to setting up a new committee would be to broaden the charter of the Scientific
        Estimates Committee.</item>

       <item>The State member stated that he would support the proposal but indicated that his

       addition included <pb n="703" xml:id="pg_703" facs="0732"/>about four pages describing the
       organization and functions of the Office of Research and Intelligence, (IRI). While this
       statement described what we are supposed to do, it was, of necessity, written in formal
       Government language.</p>
      <p>I thought it might be helpful if I filled you in more completely and more informally, with
       particular emphasis on how we hope to be of service to you.</p>
      <p>When IIA was part of the Department of State,<note n="3" xml:id="d226fn3">For documentation

       on the Intelligence Area of the Department (<gloss target="#t_OIR1">OIR</gloss>) to collect

      <p>About a year ago Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STC1">Streibert</persName>
       <note n="5" xml:id="d226fn5"><persName corresp="#p_STC1">Theodore E. Streibert</persName>,
        Director of the U.S. Information Agency.</note> went to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
        >Allen Dulles</persName> and asked him to take a look at the problem of how best to supply
        <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> with all the information it required to function. Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> accepted the job, and appointed a task force
       which studied the issue for several months in great detail both in Washington and in selected
       posts overseas.</p>
      <p>Both the National Security Council’s Intelligence Advisory Committee (<gloss
        target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss>) and the Agency accepted the recommendations of the task
        force<note n="6" xml:id="d226fn6">The task force and its recommendations have not been
        further identified, but many features of the report are summarized below and quoted in the
        enclosure.</note> and they were put into effect in September 1954.</p>
      <p>The survey team first identified six types of information which were needed by <gloss
        target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>. I am enclosing an excerpt from the Report which describes
       these in detail.</p>
      <p>The survey team concluded on the basis of these requirements that the intelligence needs of
        <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> did not differ <hi rend="italic">in kind</hi> from the
       intelligence required to support the political, economic, and military activities of the
       Government, but that <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> did require such intelligence
       “with an emphasis, a detail and a form not normally required in intelligence produced for
       other purposes”. I should point out that “intelligence”, as used in this letter and with
       respect to <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> in general, does not mean covert or “cloak
       and dagger” operations. Rather, it refers to the entire process of overt collection,
       collation, evaluation and dissemination of information and analyses on subjects relevant to
        <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> activities.</p>
      <pb n="704" xml:id="pg_704" facs="0733"/>
      <p>The survey concluded further that: <list>
        <label>(a)</label>
        <item>The total available intelligence of the types required by <gloss target="#t_USIA1"
          >USIA</gloss> had been inadequate in character and quantity, and should be
         increased;</item>
        <label>(b)</label>
        <item>The primary responsibility for the provision of the types of intelligence required by
          <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> should continue to be assigned to the Department of
         State and in a lesser degree to the other agencies of the Intelligence Community;</item>
        <label>(c)</label>
        <item><gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> should establish its own intelligence
         organization to tailor the output of the other intelligence agencies to the particular and
         peculiar applied needs of the Information Agency.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>This, in a nutshell, is our primary function.</p>
      <p>The survey group also concluded that on occasion the U.S. Information Agency, particularly
       its field staff, was a unique source of intelligence information. This would include
       information that field officers pick up about the organization and operations of foreign and
       communist media in a particular country. The survey group concluded that USIS should,
       therefore, have the responsibility of reporting this special type of information in
       coordination with the reporting by the other sections of the Embassy. You can use the most
       convenient channel for this reporting; the psychological section of the WEEKA, State
       Department despatches, or <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> despatches. One point was
       stressed—USIS field personnel should not be expected to undertake activities for the sole
       purpose of gathering information. Rather, their responsibility is to report information which
       they had gathered as a by-product to their regular activities in support of the general
        <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> program.</p>
      <p>Another point stressed by the Survey group was the function of evaluation. The group
       concluded, and we strongly concur, that the responsibility for evaluating the program cannot
       be separated from the executive responsibility for running and planning the program. We
       believe that IRI’s job is to provide to the responsible <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>
       executives all the facts and figures which are available, and upon which they can base their
       judgment as to what actions they should take.</p>
      <p>For example, if IRI were asked—“Is the radio program in the Union of South Africa<note
        n="7" xml:id="d226fn7">The words “Southern Rhodesia” are crossed out and “the Union of South
        Africa” has been inserted by hand.</note> any good?”—we would say that it was not our
       function to answer that question since it involves judgment—program judgment. We would try to
       work out with you the questions to which we wanted answers, such as: <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“How many people listen to USIS radio programs as compared to the competition?”</p>
        <p>“What type of people listen?”</p>
        <pb n="705" xml:id="pg_705" facs="0734"/>
        <p>“Why do they listen to the programs?”</p>
        <p>“What is their opinion of the programs?”</p>
       </quote></p>
      <p>etc. We would then present those findings to all levels concerned; you, your radio officer,
       IBS, the Area Directors, etc. You all could argue as to whether or not the findings indicated
       that the program was good, bad or indifferent, and whether or not the program needed change.
       IRI will follow the same principles as the <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss>, which, as you
       know, has always been scrupulously careful never to tell any operating unit what to do as a
       result of its findings. Our mission in IRI, therefore, is completely a service mission to
       provide both the USIS field missions, and the headquarters elements of <gloss
        target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>, with the information they want about foreign programs,
       issues and conditions. Specifically, IRI is not responsible for gathering or analyzing
       statistics about the output of USIS programs. That is the responsibility of each media
       concerned.</p>
      <p>The survey team found that the following four separate units, dealing with various phases
       of research and intelligence, existed within <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>: the
       Evaluation Staff (IEV) (which, among other things, contracted for research studies with
       universities and private research firms); the Coordinator of Psychological Intelligence
        (<gloss target="#t_CP1">CPI</gloss>) (which was a group of some 35 people assigned to the
       State Department, but paid by <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>); the Research and
       Library Section of IBS; and the IPS Library. Upon approval of the Report, these units were
       abolished and a new central organization was established called the Office of Research and
       Intelligence (IRI).</p>
      <p>After the usual delays caused by the merging of functions and organizations and the slow
       recruitment and appointment of qualified personnel, IRI is now getting to the point where it
       can begin to carry out its responsibilities.</p>
      <p>As a manual outlines, IRI is composed of four divisions: Collection and Liaison, Library,
       Production, and External Research. The first of these, the <hi rend="italic">Collection and
        Liaison Division</hi>, is primarily responsible for collecting the raw and finished
       intelligence from other intelligence agencies, both within this Government and from foreign
       governments; falling within the six categories spelled out in the <gloss target="#t_IAC1"
        >IAC</gloss> Survey. In addition, this division has the job of trying to convince other
       agencies to produce finished intelligence for us. To the extent that it succeeds, the work of
       the Production Division is simplified.</p>
      <p>The Collection Division also disseminates the raw and finished intelligence which it
       collects to all elements of <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>. They distribute to USIS in
       the field, and to other Government agencies, the finished production turned out by IRI. They
       are the people responsible for getting scripts declassified which have utilized paraphrases
       of some classified material in their preparation.</p>
      <pb n="706" xml:id="pg_706" facs="0735"/>
      <p>Another major responsibility of the Collection and Liaison Division is to formulate
       intelligence requirements. Normally, people come to us with a vague desire for “all the
       facts” on a given subject. We then must get them to refine and sharpen their requirements
       until we know exactly what they want, and how they plan to use the information. We then list
       the minimum information which must be collected.</p>
      <p>The Division lays requirements on the other intelligence agencies (State, Defense, <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>) to do production for us when they are better equipped. It will
       lay requirements on the field to collect information when you are the best source. As I
       mentioned above, this will primarily be where we are anxious to learn about the Communist and
       indigenous activities in the various media. In other words, this Division is the middleman
       between the user of intelligence and those who collect and produce it.</p>
      <p>The Collection and Liaison Division is headed by <persName>Ed Carroll</persName>, who had a
       lot of wartime service with <gloss target="#t_OSS1">OSS</gloss> in Europe, and was with the
       Intelligence Collection group in the Department of State for the past nine years.</p>
      <p>The second Division is the <hi rend="italic">Library Division</hi>. The nucleus of the
       collection and personnel of this Division is the old IBS and IPS libraries. The Division is
       headed by <persName>Roth Newpher</persName>, who headed the IBS Library and Research Staffs
       for 12 years. The Library has four rather distinct collections.</p>
      <p>The first section is the <hi rend="italic">book and periodical collection</hi>. We have
       some 25,000 volumes and 260 periodicals and newspapers. The collection is heavily weighted
       with Russian and Communist materials, but does cover the waterfront. Also, of course, we have
       excellent relationships with all other libraries, both Government and private, so that the
       Library can obtain almost any book on very short notice.</p>
      <p>The second section is the <hi rend="italic">unclassified morgue</hi>, which has more than 5
       million items, classified under 80,000 headings. This is a unique facility in Government.
       Nowhere else is there such a large amount of unclassified intelligence material.</p>
      <p>The third section is the <hi rend="italic">classified file</hi>. This resembles the
       unclassified, except that all documents in it are classified. This is a new section for the
       Agency, and is rapidly expanding. We have excellent relationships with the <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Library so that if we do not have a classified document
       ourselves, we can get it shortly from <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.</p>
      <p>The fourth section is the <hi rend="italic">propaganda collection</hi>, which is unique
       among collections in or out of the intelligence community. It represents an extensive
       collection of the published propaganda of foreign countries, and contains some 30,000 items
       organized by country of distribution. It is extensively cross-indexed. We must rely heavily
       on you to send us examples from your area. Many have already contributed significantly. <pb
        n="707" xml:id="pg_707" facs="0736"/>This material is constantly used by the Director and
       other headquarters personnel because it is particularly effective in demonstrating the
       opposition.</p>
      <p>The Library Division is prepared to give you very rapid service. The Library provides
       reference service for Agency personnel in Washington. It can do so by telegram or despatch
       for you.</p>
      <p>The third IRI division is the <hi rend="italic">Production Division</hi>, headed by
        <persName>Lou Olom</persName>, who for three years was Chief of the <gloss target="#t_CP1"
        >CPI</gloss> unit located in the State Department, and who has been in intelligence for the
       last 15 years.</p>
      <p>The Production Division has the responsibility of answering questions from any part of USIS
       or <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>. Sometimes these questions can be answered on the
       telephone very speedily. Sometimes they require considerable work and result in a memorandum
       of some length.</p>
      <p>The Production Division does not always answer these questions itself. If a large and
       comprehensive study is required, we will lay the requirement on other appropriate
       intelligence organizations—State, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, Defense as well as
        non-<gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> agencies such as Labor, Agriculture and Commerce
       Departments. The Production Division will make every effort to meet any deadline which you
       establish. We are a “quick and dirty” shop completely geared to the operational needs of the
       Agency. We will give you whatever information we are able to obtain within your time limit—an
       hour, a day, or a week. We believe you, the user, rather than we, should establish the
       deadline, since you know how and when you expect to use the information. Obviously, the
       shorter the deadline, the more superficial the answer.</p>
      <p>Requests from the field for information can be sent either directly to IRI or to IPS,
       depending on the type of product desired. Both IPS and IRI often work on the same requests.
       We in IRI do the research, and try to obtain all the facts bearing on the subject and place
       them in some logical order, irrespective of whether they help or hinder our cause. IPS
       utilizes these facts, as appropriate in its output. There is, therefore, no reason for you to
       change whatever system you are now using. However, if you only wish a fact or an intelligence
       analysis rather than a story, it might be a little quicker if you made that request to
       IRI.</p>
      <p>The Production Division has seven branches—the five regular areas, the USA Branch, and the
       Functional Branch.</p>
      <p>The Functional Branch is responsible for following international Communism, front
       organizations as well as local and national party propaganda methods and activities. They
       also follow media activities worldwide, so that we can detect and analyze changes in emphasis
       or procedures in Communist radio, Communist movies, etc. <persName>Paul Phillips</persName>
       is Acting Chief.</p>
      <p>The USA Branch is headed by <persName>Dick Fitzpatrick</persName>, and is responsible for
       providing background information on the United States, which you <pb n="708" xml:id="pg_708"
        facs="0737"/>and other elements of this Agency request. Again, if you want an article about
       some facet of the United States, or American life, we often provide the material to IPS and
       they, of course, do the final writing.</p>
      <p>The Soviet-Satellite Branch is responsible for obtaining the facts and figures about the
       Soviet and European Satellites, and for following their activities, particularly their
       current propaganda lines and operations. The Division is headed by <persName>Mike
        Fodor</persName>, who has lived in the area for many years, and most recently was the editor
       of the <hi rend="italic">Neue Zeitung</hi>.</p>
      <p>Your Branch, the Near East Branch, does not yet have a Branch Chief, although <persName>Joe
        Dees</persName> is acting in that capacity. Joe was at one time in the operational
       intelligence division of the Voice, but came to us from Radio Liberation.</p>
      <p>The fourth Division is the External Research Division, which has the mission of
       supplementing classical intelligence, using the unique techniques of social science. The most
       obvious area not touched by traditional intelligence seems to be public opinion surveys. We
       believe that suveys of public opinion are a unique and important addition to other sources of
       information, such as newspaper comment, editorial comment, and estimates of the situation by
       qualified observers.</p>
      <p>We are now using the survey technique to get two different types of information. The first
       is opinion on political matters, particularly as they concern our global themes—such matters
       as:</p>
      <p>What is your opinion of the United States?—of Russia?</p>
      <p>In your opinion, how are the relations between your country and the United States at the
       present time?</p>
      <p>Do you think the local Communist party is an independent party or is it controlled by the
       Soviet Union?</p>
      <p>If Western Europe were attacked with atomic or hydrogen bombs, would you approve or
       disapprove of the use of such bombs on enemy cities?</p>
      <p>Survey techniques also provide unique information on specific USIS activities, such as
       exhibits, radio programs, etc. In these surveys we ask such questions as: <quote
        rend="blockquote">
        <p>What radio programs did you listen to last night?</p>
        <p>How often do you listen to ____________ program?</p>
        <p>What is your opinion of the program?</p>
        <p>Which do you think gives you more reliable reports of the news—radio or newspaper?</p>
        <p>What is your opinion of the exhibit you have just seen?</p>
        <p>What part did yo like the best?</p>
        <p>Which the least? Why?</p>
       </quote></p>
      <p>etc.</p>
      <p>Through the science of sampling and questionnaire research, the opinions of small,
       carefully selected groups can be used to estimate the attitudes of larger groups with a high
       degree of accuracy (3–5% with <pb n="709" xml:id="pg_709" facs="0738"/>the sample-size
       generally employed). This tool can be used to study the opinions of the entire adult
       population, or just of certain groups—the youth, the educated, the city dweller, or whatever
       particular segment you are interested in.</p>
      <p>We are now conducting political surveys every four months in four countries of Western
       Europe, which we are calling Barometer Reports. We began survey operations in Western Europe,
       in part because public opinion in the American sense of the word is more meaningful there,
       and in part because the local research concerns were further developed. We believe that one
       of the chief values of these surveys is that it allows both us and you to chart trends in
       opinion with more accuracy than any other method. We plan to extend these surveys to the
       other major countries of the world as rapidly as possible. We have just finished an
       exploratory survey in four countries of Latin America, and hope to put them also on a regular
       basis.</p>
      <p>The External Research Division is very small—only five professionals—since the work is
       essentially a field function. The Agency has thus far established a <gloss target="#t_TO1"
        >TO</gloss> of twelve research officers overseas, seven are already assigned as follows:
       England, France, Germany, Austria, Italy, Brazil and Mexico. We hope to establish research
       offices soon in India, Thailand, Japan, Egypt and Iran. These officers will be regular
       members of the PAO’s staff, reporting to him, spending his GOE, in order to provide the PAO
       with the facts and figures he needs, through individual research, local contractors, or any
       other means available.</p>
      <p>If some headquarters’ element in Washington, or some other Agency, such as the National
       Security Council, desires local survey information, we will lay that requirement on the
       Public Affairs Officer. Under this system, the Research Officer becomes really familiar with
       his country and can produce rapid, efficient, and meaningful research studies. This is
       particularly true of research dealing with the impact of the USIS programs. During the
       initial stages, we are supplementing the post’s GOE with additional funds, earmarked for
       research, but this is only an interim measure until the Public Affairs Officer can include
       research in his regular budget. However, whenever IRI places an additional requirement on any
       post, which is over and above its normal concern, we will provide the Public Affairs Officer
       with additional funds so that these special requirements will not be a financial burden.</p>
      <p>The function of the External Research Division is to provide technical backstopping
       services to these research officers. Also, the Division prepares the detailed requirements,
       such as questions to be asked in order to satisfy headquarters’ needs. In the case of those
       countries which do not have a research officer, the External Research Division will provide
       as much help as possible to the Public Affairs Officer. If the PAO has some particularly
       pressing problem, IRI is prepared to <pb n="710" xml:id="pg_710" facs="0739"/>send one of its
       Washington staff on TDY for as long as necessary to obtain the information required by the
       PAO.</p>
      <p>The Division is headed by <persName>Leo Crespi</persName>, who was Research Officer in
       Germany for six years. This Division will no longer emphasize long-range basic studies. It,
       like the Production Division, is now a service shop trying to provide information as quickly
       as possible, so that it can be of practical use to all elements of USIS and <gloss
        target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>.</p>

       our assets, and our mission, so that you could understand it better, and therefore use it.

      <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Hughes</persName>:</p>
      <p>For some time I have been concerned with the adequacy of the resources of the Department of
       State’s intelligence organization. I have consulted with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AWPJ1">W.
        Park Armstrong</persName> on this question and studied in detail the proposed strengthening
       of the State Department’s intelligence program as reflected in the Department’s <gloss
        target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957 budget estimates. On the basis of this study I am convinced
       that the increases in personnel and funds sought must be granted in order to avoid serious
       impairment of the national intelligence effort.</p>
      <p>The intelligence framework of the Government has its particular problems in that, to a
       degree not often found in other governmental functions, each intelligence agency is heavily
       dependent upon others, and the President and the National Security Council are dependent upon
       the community as a whole, not simply upon one or several of its parts. I might add that this
       governmental area differs from others also in that the Director of Central Intelligence has
       certain statutory responsibilities with regard to the coordination of the activities of the
       several intelligence agencies; this indeed accounts for, and I believe justifies, my present
       comment.</p>
      <p>A careful review of the intelligence produced by the Department of State for National
       Intelligence Estimates and for other purposes of direct concern to this Agency indicates the
       need for increased positions, particularly in the following fields of endeavor:</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Special Intelligence</hi>—In this period of intensive diplomatic activity
       the Department’s particular responsibilities in this field must be discharged promptly and
       thoroughly, and the present limited staff is badly overstretched.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Intelligence on the Soviet Orbit and Its Integration</hi>—We are entering
       a period of significant change in the organization of the Communist Bloc and relations
       between Communist parties and governments. Our ability to anticipate major Communist moves
       and to conduct appropriate cold war countermeasures requires a major stepping-up of our
       analysis of the techniques, strengths, and weaknesses of the Communist Bloc mechanism. This
       can only be accomplished by the most detailed <pb n="713" xml:id="pg_713" facs="0742"
       />scrutiny of each item of evidence, whether overtly or covertly obtained, by highly
       competent political analysts.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Intelligence on Underdeveloped Areas</hi>—The ferment that exists in the
       large and highly populated areas of the world in which the U.S. and the <gloss
        target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> are engaged in an acute struggle for men’s minds requires far
       more detailed knowledge, both economic and political, than we have as yet been able to
       produce. Here the problem does not lie in the paucity of information but in adequate
       resources for compiling and analyzing data.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Public Opinion Analysis</hi>—We are only just beginning to develop
       adequate barometers of public opinion in the Free World and are becoming more and more aware
       of the need to respond to and influence such if our leadership of the Free World coalition is
       to be effective. <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>’s efforts to collect raw data in this
       field must be supported by highly competent evaluation by political intelligence experts.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Watch Function</hi>—With the approval of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
        >NSC</gloss>, the National Indications Center has been established on a 24-hour basis.
       Moreover, the Watch Committee’s activities have materially stepped up as a result of a
       constantly increasing danger of devastating damage to the U.S. in the event major aggression
       caught us flat-footed. The Department of State’s political intelligence is as vital a
       contribution to this work as is the military contributions; hence the additional positions
       requested for this work are indispensable to the over-all discharge of our early warning
       responsibility.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">United Nations and International Conference Biographic Support</hi>—In an
       era of intensive diplomatic activity including special conferences and lengthy sessions of
       the United Nations, the Department’s biographic resources have been found badly overstrained.
       This condition is enhanced by the large number of personalities included in Communist
       delegations and by the growing need to handle effectively the representatives of small but
       crucial countries.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Private Research</hi>—The need to maximize the contribution to
       intelligence by private and institutional research is obvious, not only because of its
       substantive merit, but because in the long run it involves a saving to the tax payer. Every
       effort is being made to insure that the intelligence agencies carefully coordinate their
       efforts in this field, and a considerable work load falls on the Department of State. Their
       work contributes not only to the Department but to the entire intelligence community.</p>
      <p>Summing up the foregoing, I would like to emphasize that the increases sought by the
       Department are necessary to the <hi rend="italic">national</hi> intelligence effort. They
       will not constitute a duplication of effort currently expended by the intelligence community
       nor could they be more logically performed by another intelligence agency. I would like also
       to <pb n="714" xml:id="pg_714" facs="0743"/>stress the care with which the necessity for the
       proposed increases has been scrutinized. This is in part borne out by the fact that if all
       the proposed increases are granted, the intelligence organization of the Department of State
       will still be substantially smaller than in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953.</p>
      <p>I strongly recommend that the Bureau of the Budget give its support to the proposed
       intelligence program of the Department of State for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
       1957.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>

      <p>The U.S. Air Force had been developing the concept of plastic balloon reconnaissance since
       1946. After studying the use of plastic balloons as carriers of photographic and electronic
       reconnaissance equipment since 1948, the Air Force by 1953 was experimenting and testing the
       balloons directed at the Soviet bloc. By the middle of 1954 the Air Force had test-launched
       over 500 reconnaissance balloons in Project Moby Dick and had by fall 1954 drawn up a basic
       operational concept for all future important reconnaissance programs. On March 23, 1955, Air
       Force headquarters assigned the Strategic Air Command to undertake a pioneer reconnaissance
       of Soviet territory. (Memorandum of conversation by <persName>Robert F. Packard</persName>,

       Headquarters, <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>, November, 1956, vol. 1, pp. 2–3)</p>
      <p>Project Genetrix, the codename ultimately adopted for the first U.S. Air Force large-scale,
       unmanned, high altitude balloon intelligence operation, was conceived and designed by the
       RAND Corporation for the Air Force as a means of overcoming the lack of photographic and
       meteorological intelligence on the Soviet bloc land mass. <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>
       was charged with operational responsibility for Genetrix. The plans for Genetrix initially
       called for free flight of balloons from west to east across the Soviet land mass from
       launching sites in either England, northern Europe, or the eastern Mediterranean. On June 28,
       the Air Force requested concurrence of the Department of State for conducting negotiations
       with German, Norwegian, and Turkish authorities to obtain cooperation on Genetrix activities
       on their territories.</p>
      <pb n="715" xml:id="pg_715" facs="0744"/>
      <p>By August 19, the German and Turkish Governments had assented to the operation, and,
       according to the Ambassador to Norway, the Norwegian Government was expected soon to accept
       the U.S. plans for Genetrix operations within its boundaries. (Memorandum of conversation by

      <p>While British Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Sir Anthony Eden</persName>
       consented to cooperation on Genetrix, he told President <persName corresp="#p_EJSD1"
        >Eisenhower</persName> on August 19 that if Genetrix followed soon after the Geneva Foreign
       Ministers’ conference scheduled for October, the Soviet Government could conceivably contrast
       the balloon operation with the President’s aerial inspection proposals made at the July
       summit conference. Consequently, President <persName corresp="#p_EJSD1">Eisenhower</persName>
       agreed on August 23 to postpone the initiation of Genetrix from November 1 until after the
       United States could assess the results of the Geneva Foreign Ministers’ meeting. (Memorandum

      <p>I raised with the President the situation re <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Nelson
        Rockefeller</persName>, stating that I simply wanted the President to know at this stage
       that we were having a very difficult time working with him and that, although I was trying to
       work the situation out, I was not at all sure that I would be successful in doing so. I then
       described to the President briefly my own thinking as to the proper role that someone in
        <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName>’s position <pb n="719" xml:id="pg_719"
        facs="0748"/>should play. I said that I felt that his primary function was to screen the
       many ideas, written and oral, that came into the White House in the field of foreign affairs
       and to see to it that the worthwhile ones were put into proper Government channels for
       further consideration and followed up. I said that I recognized that the regular departments
       were often so tied to daily routines that they did not have time or resourcefulness in
       dealing with new ideas. However, I said that if somebody like <persName corresp="#p_RNA1"
        >Nelson Rockefeller</persName> built up a staff of his own, as he appeared to have every
       intention of doing, he in turn became a bureaucrat and defeated the whole purpose of the
       exercise.</p>
      <p>I then showed the President the copy of the memorandum Governor <persName corresp="#p_AS1"
        >Adams</persName> had given me from <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Nelson
        Rockefeller</persName> to the President outlining his staff requirements.<note n="2"
        xml:id="d232fn2">Not found.</note> The President expressed some surprise at the size and
       complexity of the proposed staff and said that he had been unaware of all these
       arrangements.</p>

      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">I. Summary</hi></p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">A. Evaluation of U.S. Capabilities to Provide Warning of Attack</hi></p>
      <p>We believe, as we did at the time of our previous report, that the U.S. could expect
       possibly as much as six months and not less than 30 days warning of Soviet preparation for
       full-scale land, sea, and air attack, providing that the Soviets went to full, or nearly full
       mobilization prior to the attack.</p>
      <p>The current estimate of the growing air capabilities of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
        >USSR</gloss> has made us somewhat more pessimistic than we were last year regarding our
       ability to give advance intelligence warning of surprise air attack. Should the <gloss
        target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> attempt a major surprise air attack against the U.S. from
       forward bases in 1955, the preparations might be detected, <pb n="721" xml:id="pg_721"
        facs="0750"/>and if they were, would provide a generalized degree of warning of several
       days, and specific warning of unusual and possibly threatening air activity on the order of
       18–24 hours. A lesser scale of attack, involving about 250 aircraft, if accompanied by an
       extraordinary security effort could be launched as early as 1955 with no assurance of
       specific advance warning to U.S. intelligence (apart from that provided by early warning
       radar). Attacks against U.S. bases or forces overseas, or against U.S. allies, could be made
       with equal or greater likelihood of being accomplished without advance warning.</p>
      <p>In the period between now and 1958, Soviet capabilities for surprise attacks will almost
       certainly increase. Furthermore, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will have a
       progressively increasing capability for launching attacks on the U.S. from interior Soviet
       bases. Such a method of attack would probably provide no specific advance warning to U.S.
       intelligence.</p>
      <p>The USAF now operates world-wide on a 24-hour basis an Indications System for detecting
       imminent Communist attacks, especially air attack with nuclear weapons. Major air commands
       have subsidiary centers tied in with Washington by preferential use channels of communication
       for flash transmission of early warning intelligence. This system is in turn tied in with the
       unified command indications centers and with the National Indications Center in Washington,
       which is maintained on a 24-hour basis by the Watch Committee of the <gloss target="#t_IAC1"
        >IAC</gloss>.<note n="4" xml:id="d234fn4">For a description of the National Indications
        Center and the Watch Committee of the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss>, see <ref

      <p><hi rend="italic">B. Evaluation of Soviet Capabilities and Intentions</hi></p>
      <p>Intelligence to support over-all assessments of the strengths of the <gloss
        target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, Communist China, and the Satellites is generally improving.
       The general limitations of intelligence on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> are
       evident in the process of attempting to measure the forces shaping Soviet policy. We can
       illuminate the broad outlines of the chief problems confronting Soviet leadership, but we are
       still unable to determine the degree to which these problems, such as allocation of Soviet
       economic resources and German rearmament, generate pressures on Soviet policy. The main
       questions of political intelligence often involve matters of judgment on which little or no
       factual evidence can be brought to bear—the degree of independence enjoyed by Communist China
       in matters of major policy, the degree of likelihood that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
        >USSR</gloss> will withdraw from East Germany, the likelihood of open intervention by the
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in hostilities between the U.S. and Communist China
       which threatened the existence of the latter.</p>
      <p>We have made progress in economic intelligence on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
       >USSR</gloss>, most notably in improving techniques for measuring economic growth. <pb
        n="722" xml:id="pg_722" facs="0751"/>However, there remains the basic problem, that of
       determining the extent to which the Soviet economy is capable of meeting the competing claims
       for resources arising from the various internal and external commitments of Soviet policy. In
       an effort to find some solution to this problem, we have recently focused attention on a
       particularly difficult aspect of intelligence on Soviet resources allocation, the estimated
       economic cost of the over-all Soviet military effort.</p>
      <p>New techniques for acquiring and analyzing data have advanced our knowledge of Soviet
       scientific and technological capabilities. Progress has been made in intelligence on Soviet
       development of guided missiles and electronic equipment, and on the Soviet nuclear program.
       Despite advances in these and other fields, important questions such as the characteristics
       of various guided missiles, the existence and nature of a Soviet biological warfare program,
       and the apportionment of nuclear material among various types of weapons and systems, remain
       to be answered.</p>
      <p>Although we have succeeded in collecting much information on the separate branches of the
       Soviet armed forces, we have yet to construct the picture of probable Soviet strategy so
       essential to estimating general trends in the Soviet military establishment, probable Soviet
       choices in weapons systems, or the strength of particular military components. The
       requirement for such estimates is particularly urgent at the present time because of recent
       indications that Soviet military thinking is adjusting to the impact of modern military
       technology.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">C. Collection</hi></p>
      <p>In most respects there has been little over-all change in our collection capabilities
       within the Bloc, largely because of the continued strict enforcement of Sino-Soviet security
       and counterintelligence measures. However, there has been a considerable improvement in the
       collection of intelligence data through technological means such as <gloss target="#t_ELINT1"
        >ELINT</gloss>, together with increasing use of aerial reconnaissance. Evacuation of U.S.
       forces from Austria will deprive the military services of a significant intelligence base.
       Service collection units in Austria will be transferred to West Germany, where operational
       requirements are being carefully considered in U.S.-West German negotiations on a new Forces
        Arrangement.<note n="5" xml:id="d234fn5">Under the terms of the Austrian State Treaty signed

      <p rend="flushleft">Dear <persName corresp="#p_HRR1">Rowland</persName>:</p>
      <p>This is to confirm our conversation in which I recommended to you that the Planning
       Coordination Group be abolished, and that I resign as Vice Chairman of the Operations
       Coordinating Board. We are preparing an informal memorandum for you setting forth the
       problems that must be considered in regard to the functions of the Group.</p>
      <p>I would suggest that December thirty-first be considered the termination date as this would
       give time to arrange for the orderly transfer of existing responsibilities and completion of
       the work in progress.</p>
      <p>I am sorry to make this recommendation. However, it is clear after six months experience
       that this mechanism will not be able to accomplish the objectives set forth in the memorandum
       of March 3, 1955,<note n="2" xml:id="d235fn2"><ref target="#d210">Document 210</ref>.</note>
       which was approved by the President.</p>
      <p>A meeting of the Planning Coordination Group members will be held next week. At that time I
       will discuss this recommendation with them.<note n="3" xml:id="d235fn3"><p><persName

      <p rend="flushleft">Dear <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName>:</p>
      <p>The Task Force on Intelligence Activities (“<persName corresp="#p_CGRM1">Clark</persName>
       Committee”) of the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government,
        (<persName corresp="#p_HH1">Hoover</persName> Commission), in its <hi rend="italic"
        >public</hi> Report to the Congress on Intelligence dated May 1955, but released in
        June,<note n="2" xml:id="d236fn2"><ref target="#d220">Document 220</ref>.</note> makes a
       number of disparaging statements concerning the attitude of the Department of State toward
       intelligence collection activities. In the Conclusions and Recommendations (Part VII, pages
       37–38) it is stated: <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“… Also among some of those responsible for implementation of our foreign policy by
         diplomacy and negotiation, there seems to exist an abhorrence to anything that might lead
         to diplomatic or even protocol complications.</p>
        <p>“This negative attitude, usually at the desk level, at times stifled initiative and
         action in the collection of intelligence. Some of these efforts, if permitted to proceed
         properly, might have brought direct and immediate results and made positive contributions
         to the national welfare that would have justified the attendant political risks and
         possible inconsequential diplomatic embarrassment.”</p>
       </quote></p>
      <p>Further on, referring to the inadequacy of data on the Soviet Bloc, the Report says that:
        <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“… Success in this field depends on greater boldness at the policy level, a willingness
         to accept certain calculated political and diplomatic risks, and full use of technological
         capabilities.”</p>
       </quote></p>
      <p>The Department is naturally concerned at such allegations and desires to learn what the
       basis for them might be. In the Top Secret Task Force Report dated May 1955,<note n="3"
        xml:id="d236fn3"><ref target="#d221">Document 221</ref>.</note> I can find no substantiating
       data or argumentation for the implied charges against the Department made in the public
       report. However, according to the <hi rend="italic">Top Secret</hi> Report, Appendix II,
       which has not been available to the Department, fully discusses [<hi rend="italic">less than
        1 line not declassified</hi>]. Would it be possible for you to make this Appendix available
       to me on a highly restricted basis? Alternatively, could you send to us a statement,
       generally summarizing <pb n="725" xml:id="pg_725" facs="0754"/>the Report’s position on this
       matter, as was, I believe, suggested by the President’s Military Secretary.</p>
      <p>Directly related to the question of what was said by the public Task Force Report would be
       the views of your Agency on the question of the Department’s attitude toward intelligence and
       intelligence operations. Naturally the Department would wish to know it if this analysis is
       correct in your view, and would wish promptly to take remedial action if legitimate
       intelligence activities are inhibited by the actions of Foreign Service or Departmental
       officers.</p>

        <pb n="726" xml:id="pg_726" facs="0755"/>paper, i.e. a representative of the Secretary of

       <item>Defense (<persName>Charlie Sullivan</persName>) questioned whether in Par. 3 of the
        memorandum to the Chairman of <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> it is sufficient to state
        that the original objectives of the <gloss target="#t_PCG1">PCG</gloss> continue valid and
        other means should be sought to achieve these objectives. <persName>Sullivan</persName>
        thought the <gloss target="#t_PCG1">PCG</gloss> might consider suggesting some alternative
        means. I took the line and was supported by <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Nelson</persName>
        and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> that that statement went far enough for the time
        being and we should not consider alternative mechanisms now.</item>
      </list>
      <p>One additional point was raised by <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Nelson
        Rockefeller</persName>, namely to explain the reason for his resignation as Vice Chairman of
       the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>. His explanation was that the Budget Bureau have
       never liked the idea of establishing a Vice Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_OCB1"
        >OCB</gloss>. He did not expand further on the matter.</p>
      <p>I took the general position on these points that in your absence I could not give
       Departmental approval but that we would consider them further when submitted.</p>

      <p>It is considered that the current security practices and the procedures for acting on
       adverse information essentially fulfill the objectives of these recommendations. Within the
       objectives, however, it is desirable to leave to each individual service reasonable latitude
       in the method of implementation. For example, it may in some cases aid the investigation not
       to alert the individual involved by suspending him. Measures are taken, of course, in such
       cases to insure that classified information is adequately safeguarded. This general subject
       is being reviewed in order to insure that the underlying objectives of these recommendations
       are adequately served.</p>

      <p>The collection of scientific intelligence is one of the most important intelligence

       and inefficient to give it or any other agency a monopoly in this field, nor does any one

       and allied activities. It and its elements have taken various measures during the past years
       to further such a program. But in the case of ROTC and reserves, the Department of Defense is
       reluctant to provide for additional language training if such training must be at the expense
       of training in primary military subjects. Specifically, the Task Force’s recommendation would

      <p>We have once again carefully reviewed Appendix II which deals with certain aspects of
        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>’s work.<note n="5" xml:id="d241fn5">Appendix II, which
        discussed the clandestine service of the Central Intelligence Agency, is not printed.</note>
       The pertinent portions of this report appear to be:</p>
      <p>“The allocation of funds for all projects of psychological warfare to specific areas, more
       particularly for propaganda, has been consistently influenced and too frequently interfered
       with by low-level State Department representatives since the beginning of the cold-war
       program. This intervention in the program by such representatives, whose interests are narrow
       and restricted to their assigned country areas, has at times in the past resulted not only in
       misdirected efforts on the part of the Clandestine Services, but in serious financial losses
       to the Government also, without a fair measure of gainful return. These might have been
       avoided had the <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> been given long-range national policy
       guidance at higher State Department level and had been permitted then to act on his own
       judgment, or, better still, had <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> more clearly defined the
       prerogatives of the <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> in carrying out his cold-war mission.
       To the surveying officer it is significant that <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> gave to
       the <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> the sole responsibility for carrying out cold-war
       operations aimed at the Communist bloc. Nowhere in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
       directives pertaining to this mission is it indicated that the <gloss target="#t_DCI1"
        >DCI</gloss>’s responsibility therefor may be delegated to, or shared with, any other
       Government agency.… While there is no evidence revealed in this survey concerning any serious
       disagreement between <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> officials and these same
       representatives with respect to psychological warfare, it is clearly indicated that, as far
       as the Office of the Secretary of State is concerned, such policy advice has come on a
       piece-meal basis and too often not from specifically designated representatives of that
       agency.”</p>
      <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (3½ lines) not declassified</hi>]</p>
      <p>I consider that there is no real basis of fact for the above allegations regarding the
       State Department’s attitude. As regards policy guidance, the Department has been wholly
       cooperative and I do not consider that there has been any improper “intervention” or
       “interference” in the carrying out by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> of cold war
       programs. [<hi rend="italic">3 lines not declassified</hi>]</p>

       at a cost of approximately $70,000,000, with personnel all over the world. The operation will
       probably produce intelligence data of considerable significance. Also, reasonable cover has
       been devised in that similar operations have, in fact, been conducted from a good many points
       in the United States and elsewhere, designed to obtain meteorological data. This cover will
       probably not fool the Soviets, but it will create a situation such that they cannot take any

       <item>Research on Psychochemicals</item>
      </list>
      <list>
       <label>1.</label>
       <item>For the past four years the Central Intelligence Agency has been actively engaged in
        research on a group of powerful chemicals affecting the human mind called psychochemicals.
        We have developed extensive professional contacts, experience and a considerable amount of
        information on many psychochemicals including in particular a material known as LSD. This
        Agency is continuing its interest in this field, and in the light of its accumulated
        experience offers its cooperation and assistance to research and development programs which
        the Department of Defense is considering at this time.</item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>The Agency became interested in the potential importance of psychochemicals, primarily
        because of the enthusiasm and foresight of Dr. <persName>L. Wilson Greene</persName>,
        Technical Director of the Chemical and Radiological Laboratories at the Army Chemical
        Center. Dr. <persName>Greene</persName>’s ideas were included in a report written by him in
        1949 entitled “Psychochemical Warfare, a New Concept of War”.</item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>Since 1951 this Agency has carried out a program of research which has provided
        important information on the nature of the abnormal behavior produced by LSD and the way
        this effect varies with such factors as size of dose, differences in the individual and
        environment. The behavioral effects of repeated doses given over a long time <pb n="737"
         xml:id="pg_737" facs="0766"/>has been studied. We have established that individuals may
        develop a tolerance to LSD. A search for possible antidotes is being made. It has been found
        that LSD produces remarkable mental effects when taken in exceedingly small doses. The
        foregoing became increasingly interesting when it was recently discovered that LSD could be
        synthesized in quantity.</item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item>There are many characteristics of LSD and other psychochemicals which either have not
        been studied or require further study. We are continuing to search for a satisfactory
        antidote for LSD as well as other defensive measures. More data should be accumulated if it
        is desired to predict the precise effect upon a given individual under given circumstances.
        It would appear to be important that field trials be made to determine the effects on groups
        of people or on individuals engaged in group activities.</item>
       <label>5.</label>
       <item>This Agency’s scientists who have been responsible for this research in psychochemicals
        have maintained close and effective liaison with various research and development groups in
        the Department of Defense who are aware of our interest and, in varying degrees, of our
        progress in psychochemicals. Some of these individuals are: <quote rend="blockquote">

       <label>6.</label>
       <item>In addition, this Agency has provided financial support for certain projects in the
        field of psychochemicals being conducted by the Chemical Corps and by the Office of Naval
        Research. We have noted with considerable interest the current Department of Defense study
        of the potential importance of certain psychochemical materials including LSD which is being
        carried out by the Ad Hoc Study Group on Psychochemicals under the Technical Advisory Panel
        on <gloss target="#t_CW1">CW</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_BW1">BW</gloss> of the Office of

      <p>1. The Planning Coordination Group was established within the framework of the <gloss
        target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> by letter of the President of March 10, 1955.<note n="2"

       Budget <pb n="740" xml:id="pg_740" facs="0769"/>Director’s memorandum to the President of
       March 3, which the President approved March 4, subject: “Coordination of Economic,

        xml:id="d246fn3"><ref target="#d210">Document 210</ref>.</note></p>
      <p>2. Paragraph 3 a of the Budget Director’s memorandum states that the Planning Coordination
       Group should report directly to the Chairman of <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>, who
       would from time to time transmit progress reports of the Group to the President through the
       National Security Council. Accordingly, this report is submitted with the request that it be
       so transmitted.<note n="4" xml:id="d246fn4"><ref target="#d248">Document

      <p rend="center">II. Report</p>
      <p>3. The Planning Coordination Group was established to aid in developing planning in both
       overt and covert fields and to advise and assist the responsible operating agencies in the
       coordinated development of plans and programs to carry out those national security policies
       appropriate to its functions. After seven months’ experience, it is clear to the four members
       of the Group that the Planning Coordination Group mechanism will not be able to accomplish
       these objectives. The Group therefore <hi rend="italic">recommends</hi> that the President
       abolish the Planning Coordination Group effective December 31, 1955.</p>
      <p>4. The Planning Coordination Group was also given specific responsibilities for being
       advised of and channeling support to major covert programs (<gloss target="#t_NSC1"

         229</ref>, <ref target="#d240">240</ref>, and <ref target="#d242">242</ref>.</note> was
       very hazy in his mind. He did not know how it had gotten started, although he did recall that
       it had been mentioned by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LEH1">Land</persName> in his office at the
       time of the <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> Report.<note n="3"
        xml:id="d249fn3">Headed by <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">James R. Killian</persName>,
        President of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Technological Capabilities Panel of
        the Science Advisory Committee prepared a study, issued on February 14, requested by the
        President on U.S. technological capability to reduce the threat of surprise attack. See <ref
         target="#d223">Document 223</ref>.</note> He now understood that it represents about a $75
       million investment, and that it is ready for initiation very soon. <persName
        corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
        Radford</persName> had stated that he had presented the matter to the President for
       consideration, and he also said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> had
       also stated that the matter had been presented to the President. He said that there is
       nothing in the records about this. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
       recalled that just prior to the Geneva meeting he had raised with the President the question
       whether it should be held in abeyance.<note n="4" xml:id="d249fn4">See <ref target="#d229"
         >Document 229</ref>.</note></p>
      <p>The President then said that regardless of how the matter progressed, it is timely to
       consider what should be done now. He understood that a plane that is being developed is
       coming along very well.<note n="5" xml:id="d249fn5">The U–2, a joint <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
         >CIA</gloss>–U.S. Air Force reconnaissance aircraft.</note> It also appeared that if the
       balloons were discovered, as they will be, certain questions become important—such as what
       will public reaction be in the UK and Japan, how many of them are likely to be shot down,
       whether their release will spur the development of higher altitude radar, etc. <persName
        corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName> said it is practically impossible to pick
       these up by radar. It is also practically impossible to intercept them—our Air Force has made
       extensive attempts to do so and has never succeeded.</p>
      <p>Replying to a question by the President, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GT1">Gardner</persName>
       said there are approximately 2500 of these balloons. It is expected that 500 to 600 would
       pass through to the Western coast of the Pacific. One-half would travel at about 40,000 feet
       and the other half could be sent much higher. The project is manned with 4400 people in the
       United States and 1400 overseas. The President asked whether the project should not be
       presented as meteorological, with pictures taken to show ground speed, etc. Secretary
        <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said a further question is whether to do it at
       all. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GT1">Gardner</persName> said that by late April or May four
       alternative items, with trained crews, should be available and capable of operating at <pb
        n="745" xml:id="pg_745" facs="0774"/>approximately 80,000 feet.<note n="6" xml:id="d249fn6"

       <persName corresp="#p_CGCP1">General Cabell</persName> viewed the present project as a
       supplement, and thought if the balloons were kept below 50,000 feet they would not stimulate
       a “crash” radar program. There was discussion whether possible political reaction might tend
       to prevent use of the alternative when it is ready—in that case it might be well to consider
       delaying the whole project a year. The President said that there is a natural tendency toward
       reluctance for a bold program. If the results seem necessary, he would do it, but that is the
       question. He thought that an effort involving 2500 in a few months might cause alarm, where a
       dozen or so a week would not have a “crash” significance (Secretary <persName
        corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> asked what would be lost if the action were delayed for
       a year—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GT1">Gardner</persName> said that the force will have to be
       largely disbanded and material would crack and disintegrate).</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GT1">Gardner</persName> said that low altitude winds are
       satisfactory throughout the year except in July and August, and that if the lower altitudes
       were used—which seem desirable—the release could be phased out. The President thought they
       should be released at a number of points throughout the world. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> felt an agreed news release will be extremely important,
       and the President said it must tell a good story. <persName corresp="#p_CGCP1">General
        Cabell</persName> suggested that other countries be approached to ask them to return the
       equipment gondolas when they come down. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>
       agreed that it made a great difference if they were released a few at a time and in many
       places all over the world. The President thought that the announcement should be on the basis
       that when the winds are right, we will get off a number from all stations. He thought that if
       this is presented as a meteorological operation, it would be all right; he did not feel it
       could be done just in January and February, i.e., it should not be a “crash” program. Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> suggested the following as points on which to
       agree: Launchings should be spread over time; medium altitudes should be used—50 to 55
       thousand feet; some should be released from Japan, Honolulu and Alaska; notice should be
       given to other countries and to the world at large. The President indicated agreement and
       suggested that this notice bring out that we would like to have the items returned; that if
       any country wanted to develop the prints, they should take care not to destroy the negatives;
       that all languages should be used on the request for return, including Russian; that State
       Department should review the cover plan (Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
        >Dulles</persName> to get a little group together to look at this); that the long-term
       aspect of the thing should be emphasized, bringing out that efforts in the past have been too
       intermittent and relating it to the “jet stream” shift responsible for the recent floods in
       California. To a question by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> as to
       how the photographing operation is to be <pb n="746" xml:id="pg_746" facs="0775"/>explained,
       it was indicated that operations are well advanced to inform the authorities of the
       International Geophysical Year<note n="7" xml:id="d249fn7">The International Geophysical Year

       as a means of mapping cloud formations (which is, in fact, all that most photographs will

         >Eisenhower</persName> was given a technical briefing on December 27. On the next day

        approved the operation subject to “certain modifications,” which included slowing down the

      <p><hi rend="italic">Agency Comment:</hi>
       <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> opposes the recommendation on the grounds that: (1) “the
       experience of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> during the period of separate operation
       prior to 1952 proved the operational disadvantages of attempting to conduct, on a secure and
       efficient basis, two world-wide clandestine organizations, each compartmented from the
       other”; and (2) organizations of separate supporting elements for each of the clandestine
       services would be duplicative, costly and ineffective.</p>

      <p><hi rend="italic">Observation:</hi>
       <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>’s view should be adopted since the majority proposal of
       the Task Force has been tried previously and found less satisfactory than present
       organizational arrangements which combine the covert and cold war functions of <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. (The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> view is consistent

        xml:id="d251fn2"><ref target="#d192">Document 192</ref>.</note> whose survey of <gloss

      <p><hi rend="italic">Recommendation 2</hi> (page 73): That <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>

      <p><hi rend="italic">Agency Comment:</hi>
       <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> concurs in the creation of, and has established, an
       Office of Basic Intelligence. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> notes that the balance of
       this recommendation consists of suggesting that the names of four of the offices under the
       Deputy Director of Intelligence be changed. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> will change
       the name of one of these offices shortly, but believes that little will be accomplished in
       effecting the other name changes suggested.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Additional Action Required:</hi> None.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Recommendation 3</hi> (page 73): That <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>

      <p><hi rend="italic">Agency Comment:</hi>
       <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is opposed on the grounds that the interposition of

      <p><hi rend="italic">Recommendation 4</hi> (page 73): That the status of the three major

      <p><hi rend="italic">Agency Comment:</hi>
       <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> concurs in the recommended pay increases but thinks it

       remainder of the Defense comment thereon is quoted in full: <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“<gloss target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss> No. 5 has been interpreted as assigning to
          <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> the exclusive right to control and conduct covert
         foreign intelligence operations. Such activities as the services have been allowed to
         conduct during the past 7 or 8 years in this important field even in war theaters have been
         essentially on the sufferance of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. Meanwhile, however,
          <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>’s record of performance in covert intelligence
         operations of direct interest to the mission of the Armed Services has been disappointing,
         particularly against primary Soviet orbit intelligence targets. The services, which
         consider that they have generally a longer record of experience in this work, are convinced
         that they can produce through covert operations more effectively than <gloss
          target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> various needed categories of intelligence related to their
         particular missions and requirements. They point out moreover that <gloss target="#t_CIA1"

         satisfactory to the services. It provides for a measure of participation by them in covert
         operations on a best-qualified basis. The services believe their right to participate
         should be explicit in a <gloss target="#t_NSCID1">NSCID</gloss> and not dependent on a
         subsidiary agreement.</p>
        <p>It is too early to judge whether this agreement will prove workable. First steps have
         been taken by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to function under the agreement, and the
         services are proceeding to strengthen their covert collection resources. Each side tends to
         be wary of the other; and more generosity and good will than has been shown in the past
         will be necessary if the present tentative arrangement is to work.</p>
        <p>Monitorship over this problem has been assigned to the Assistant to the Secretary of

       intelligence agencies are not satisfied with the quality or quantity of intelligence gained

       State reports that “this recommendation requires no implementation in the Department of

      <p><hi rend="italic">Observation:</hi> State has missed the point of this recommendation. All
       agencies now have the authority to suspend employees under the circumstances indicated in the
       recommendation. The point the Task Force appears to be making is that some of the agencies
       fail to suspend when there is sufficient cause and it is the Task Force’s view that in the
       intelligence organizations of our government in particular, such suspension should occur
       pending final determination of the employee’s case.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Recommendation 2</hi> (page 283): That the “findings and proposed

       status of such cases is available to the President, through the executive agencies he has
       designated, to report on the implementation of Executive Order 10450.</p>
      <p>State advises that detailed reports concerning the very small percentage of such employees
       in its Intelligence Area have been made available to the Civil Service Commission, and that

       of the intelligence agencies concerned report the findings and disposition of alleged

      <p><gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> considers that its current security practices

       it is unsound. In lieu of subjecting employees to reinvestigations at least every 5 years a
       good counterintelligence program is what is needed. When employees are initially brought on
       board they should be exhaustively checked. Thereafter they should not be harassed by
       reinvestigations, but should be accepted as loyal, bona fide Americans unless
       counterintelligence discloses reasons for contrary views. Wholesale investigations of the
       type called for by the Task Force would constitute unjustifiable use of manpower and money,
       would not be productive of substantial results, and would be harmful to the morale of the
       employees concerned. Reinvestigations should be made on a selective, rather than wholesale,
       basis and only when there is reasonable cause therefor.</p>

      <p>The recommendations discussed below are from Appendix I of the Task Force Report. The
       Department of Defense comments are supplementary to those submitted by the Director of
       Central Intelligence for the United States Communications Intelligence Board (<gloss

      <p>“That the National Security Council direct <gloss target="#t_USCIB1">USCIB</gloss> to
       establish <gloss target="#t_COMINT1">COMINT</gloss> realities and consideration of
       capabilities of other intelligence sources. This operational guidance to <gloss

        >USCIB</gloss> fails after a reasonable length of time to provide more adequate guidance to
       the Director, <gloss target="#t_NSA1">NSA</gloss>, then the latter should be made a member of
       the Intelligence Advisory Committee.”</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Department of Defense Position:</hi></p>
      <p>1. Concur, subject to comment.</p>
      <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi></p>
      <p>It is doubtful that <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> membership for the Director, <gloss
        target="#t_NSA1">NSA</gloss>, would solve the problem; it would probably raise additional
       complications.</p>
      <p>In this connection, the Department of Defense considers that the present status and
       membership of the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> give rise to ambiguity which this
       particular recommendation would only sharpen. The <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> is
       unique in being neither a policy nor an operational body, but a mixture of the two. This is
       the result partly of unforeseen evolution within the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss>, and
       partly of significant changes which have occurred within the Department of Defense since the
        <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> was established.</p>
      <p>To the extent that the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> intended the <gloss
        target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> to serve as a policy body, its Defense membership (the three
       Services and <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>) is at once diffuse and incomplete in that
       the Service representation is largely at an operating rather than a policy level and the
       Secretary of Defense is not directly represented, although the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
        >JCS</gloss> representative (Chairman, Joint Intelligence Committee) coordinates with the
       appropriate elements of OSD. On the other hand, to the extent that the <gloss
        target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> serves as a body concerned with the coordination and
       formulation of intelligence estimates and the coordination of operational intelligence
       matters, its present formalized structure may not be entirely necessary. The three Service
       intelligence chiefs are suitable representation in this context, and although the Chairman,
        <gloss target="#t_JIC1">JIC</gloss>, does not conduct operations, he is the appropriate
       indirect representative of the Secretary of Defense for these matters. In its dual capacity
       the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> works, but in an unnecessarily complicated and
       probably uneconomical context of differing levels of activity.</p>
      <p>The Department of Defense considers that a more desirable ultimate organization of the top
       structure of U.S. intelligence would <pb n="774" xml:id="pg_774" facs="0803"/>involve a
       single board with policy cognizance over all aspects of intelligence. The Secretary of
       Defense’s representative would be an appropriate civilian official, competent to act for him.
       Under this board would be several specialist committees to deal with operational matters; one
       concerned with communications and electronics intelligence and communications security (as
       recommended by the <persName corresp="#p_CGRM1">Clark</persName> Task Force); another with
       intelligence operations; a third with intelligence production; and possibly others.
       Representation on these committees would be provided by the Service intelligence chiefs and
       other operators (such as the Director, <gloss target="#t_NSA1">NSA</gloss>) when
       appropriate.</p>
      <p>The following main points summarize the views that are crystallizing in the Department of
       Defense on the general subject of intelligence: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense must assume final responsibility
         for guidance and control over all aspects of intelligence.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>The Director of Central Intelligence as the actual executive agent must have adequate
         and clearly defined coordinative powers under the Secretaries of State and Defense.</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>National intelligence policy is under the cognizance of the National Security Council.
         However, because of the sensitive nature of important elements of intelligence,
         intelligence matters might most appropriately be dealt with by a Special Committee of the
          <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> (which is now the case, to the satisfaction of all
         concerned, with respect to <gloss target="#t_COMINT1">COMINT</gloss> and COMSEC matters:
         the Secretaries of State and Defense, and the Attorney General for matters under his
         cognizance, with the advice of the Director of Central Intelligence, constitute the Special
         Committee of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>).</item>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item>The concept behind <gloss target="#t_USCIB1">USCIB</gloss> has proved to be the most
         satisfactory solution so far in one important intelligence area. Appropriately modified, it
         could usefully be applied to the entire intelligence field.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>The changes which this general concept would involve do not require legislation. Internal
       reorganization within the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> and probably an executive order
       to establish the new organization would suffice.</p>
      <p>The Department of Defense proposes to discuss this subject further with the Director of
       Central Intelligence and the Department of State, and hopes in due course together with them
       to arrive at an agreed proposal for submission.</p>

      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Department of Defense Position:</hi></p>
      <p><gloss target="#t_USCIB1">USCIB</gloss> considered that this recommendation pertains to an
       internal problem within the Department of Defense, and has accordingly referred it to this
       Department for comment.</p>
      <p>The Department of Defense has long recognized that high professional standards and
       opportunity for a rewarding career for military and civilian personnel engaged in the
       communications intelligence effort must be strengthened if we are to deal successfully with
       the increasingly difficult technical problems confronting that effort. One means of achieving
       this objective is to constitute the Service cryptologic agencies as major commands. These
       should be subordinate neither to the intelligence nor to the communications elements within
       the Services, but should in each case report directly to the chief of staff. Adequate
       recognition of cryptology as a major operational career field cannot be otherwise
       achieved.</p>
      <p>The Air Force cryptologic agency, the Security Service (<gloss target="#t_AFSS1"
        >AFSS</gloss>), has been so constituted for approximately seven years. The <gloss
        target="#t_AFSS1">AFSS</gloss> is responsible for <gloss target="#t_COMINT1">COMINT</gloss>
       production [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] and COMSEC activities,
       and in addition operated the Air Force’s ground-based <gloss target="#t_ELINT1">ELINT</gloss>
       stations and its SSO (Special Security Officer) system for the dissemination of <gloss
        target="#t_COMINT1">COMINT</gloss>. Largely because of its status as a major command, the
        <gloss target="#t_AFSS1">AFSS</gloss> has developed a dynamic and promising <pb n="776"
        xml:id="pg_776" facs="0805"/>program for recruiting, developing and holding on to
       technically qualified military career personnel.</p>
      <p>Until recently the Army cryptologic agency (the Army Security Agency (<gloss
        target="#t_ASA1">ASA</gloss>)) was responsible for <gloss target="#t_COMINT1">COMINT</gloss>
       production [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] and for COMSEC. It was
       subordinate to <gloss target="#t_G21">G–2</gloss>. On 23 June 1955, the <gloss
        target="#t_ASA1">ASA</gloss> was designated as a major command responsible to the Chief of
       Staff, with virtually complete cognizance over all Army aspects of <gloss target="#t_COMINT1"
        >COMINT</gloss>, COMSEC, <gloss target="#t_ELINT1">ELINT</gloss> and communications
       electromagnetic countermeasures (<gloss target="#t_ECM1">ECM</gloss>). It is anticipated that
       this action will facilitate development of an energetic Army cryptologic career program
       paralleling that of the Air Force.</p>
      <p>The Navy cryptologic activity, the Navy Security Group (<gloss target="#t_NSG1"
       >NSG</gloss>), is not so constituted. It operates at a lower echelon and under divided
       intelligence and communications cognizance. The <gloss target="#t_NSG1">NSG</gloss> does not
       nominally have a commanding officer; it functions under the Chief of Security Branch who in
       turn reports to the Director, Naval Communications. The responsibilities of the <gloss
        target="#t_NSG1">NSG</gloss> include <gloss target="#t_COMINT1">COMINT</gloss> production
        [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] COMSEC, and <gloss
        target="#t_ELINT1">ELINT</gloss>.</p>
      <p>The Secretary of Defense proposes in the near future to ask the Secretary of the Navy to
       review the placement of the Navy cryptologic organization to determine whether a
       subordination and structure more closely paralleling that of the Army and the Air Force might
       not be advantageous.</p>

       is careful to conform to policy established by the Council, and to request Council
       authorization for any proposed action which is not covered by existing policy. In addition it
       is the practice of <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> to keep the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"

       <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> does not concur. It notes that cover employed by <gloss

       is a natural and essential adjunct to the defector program, provided their activities are

       <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> concurs and has in effect a number of measures the

      <p><hi rend="italic">Agency Comment:</hi>
       <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> observes that this recommendation is based on a
       separation of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> “cold war” and “covert intelligence
       functions” with which <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> does not concur. It notes, however,

      <p><hi rend="italic">Agency Comment:</hi>
       <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> concurs. This action is being taken as rapidly as

      <p><hi rend="italic">Agency Comment:</hi>
       <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> concurs. It has been working toward the objective of this

       fleeing from persecution. Under present conditions, and with due regard for the effects of
       such action on the diplomatic and political interests of the United States, it is also in the
       important interests of national security that defectors be welcomed and assisted in obtaining
       a degree of personal and economic security and made to feel that there is a place for them in
       a free society. The best sources of information and intelligence on the Soviet world,
       necessary in the interests of the national security, are defectors from Soviet control. The
       most effective agents to destroy the communist myth of the Soviet paradise are defectors who
       are able to tell the truth about conditions of life behind the Iron Curtain.</p>
      <p>2. The term “defectors” is here employed to denote individuals who escape from the control

       the diplomatic and political interests of the United States. Any overt publicity and
       propaganda exploitation of a defector shall be coordinated with the Department of State.</p>
      <p>5. The Central Intelligence Agency shall be responsible for the covert exploitation of
       defectors, and shall, within the framework of paragraph 4, coordinate all matters concerned
       with the handling and disposition of declared defectors from the Soviet Union and the
       satellite states in order to assure the effective exploitation of all defectors for
       operational, intelligence, or psychological purposes by the U.S. Government.</p>
      <p>6. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> shall seek the guidance of the appropriate

        There were three changes. First the sentence in parentheses at the end of preambular
